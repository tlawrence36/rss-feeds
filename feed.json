      "A previously unknown musical work written by composer Frederic Chopin appears to have been found in a library in New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: \u201cChopin.\u201d",
      "A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan.",
      "The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan.",
      "Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century.",
      "But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand.",
      "The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its \u201cvery stormy, brooding opening section\u201d before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained.",
      "\u201cThis is his style. This is his essence,\u201d he said during a recent visit to the museum. \u201cIt really feels like him.\u201d",
      "McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school.",
      "McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity.",
      "The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name \u201cChopin\u201d written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else.",
      "Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis.",
      "He\u2019s buried among a pantheon of artists at the city\u2019s famed P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland.",
      "Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris.",
      "Musically, the piece evokes the \u201cbrilliant style\u201d that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style,\" Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month.",
      "He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise.",
      "Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a \u201clittle gem\u201d that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance.",
      "\u201cMany of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short \u2013 kind of like \u2018appetizers\u2019 to a full-blown work,\u201d Kallberg said in an email. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift.\u201d",
      "David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cIt has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well,\u201d said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document.",
      "But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin\u2019s shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin\u2019s works were intended.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn\u2019t matter because it sparks our imaginations,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cA discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form.\u201d",
      "The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.",

      "It was mostly Chris Stapleton\u2019s night at the Country Music Association Awards",
      "Chris Stapleton took home four Country Music Association Awards and hardly left the stage on Wednesday night, while an absent Morgan Wallen was shut out all evening until taking the night's biggest prize, entertainer of the year.",
      "Stapleton's wins included song of the year and single of the year for \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d and he took the stage at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, three times to perform during the ABC telecast, including a show-opening duet with Post Malone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really honored for this, thank you very much,\" the always subdued country traditionalist Stapleton said as he accepted the male vocalist of the year award for a record-extending eighth time.",
      "For much of the night it seemed the leading nominee Wallen, up for seven, would be shut out, until presenter Jeff Bridges gave a botched rendering of his name as \"Morgan Waylon\" when he announced entertainer of the year.",
      "Four of Wallen's nominations came for his hit collaboration with Malone, \u201cI Had Some Help,\" though the song, and the first-time nominee Malone, went winless.",
      "But the rapper-singer Malone was all smiles all night at the CMAs after releasing his first country album earlier in the year. With Stapleton, he sang his song \u201cCalifornia Sober\u201d in full cowboy regalia, including a bolo tie as big as a belt buckle. He later took the stage solo to sing the emotional \u201cYours,\u201d which he dedicated to his young daughter.",
      "Stapleton later performed his own \u201cWhat Am I Gonna Do\u201d with his wife Morgane, and performed yet again as part of an all-star tribute to George Strait, who received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s entertainer of the year, Lainey Wilson, hosted the show along with Luke Bryan and NFL great Peyton Manning, and won two CMAs \u2014 female vocalist of the year, and best music video for \u201cWildflowers and Wild Horses.\u201d",
      "For a while it seemed Stapleton would get a sweep, but he lost out on album of the year to a surprised Cody Johnson, who took the trophy for \u201cLeather.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought Chris Stapleton or Jelly Roll was going to win,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Old Dominion won vocal group of the year for a record seventh straight time, surpassing the six won by Little Big Town.",
      "The Stapleton-Malone opening and much of the night were a celebration of a time of crossover and collaboration in country.",
      "The telecast, available on Hulu for streaming Thursday, featured performances from artist combos including Brooks & Dunn, representing the 1990s and 2000s, with Jelly Roll, representing country's current moment. They gave an emotional gospel-style performance of Brooks & Dunn's 2005 song \u201cBelieve.\"",
      "Brooks & Dunn followed it up by winning vocal duo of the year for the 15th time and the first time since 2006.",
      "Shaboozey brought the crowd to its feet with a solo performance that began with a bit of his more sober single \u201cHighway\u201d before launching into one of the year's defining hits, \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\"",
      "But he lost out on best new artist to Megan Moroney, who won minutes after her own performance.",
      "\u201cThank you Jesus for putting this dream on my heart,\u201d Moroney, a 27-year-old from Georgia, said with misty eyes as she accepted the award.",
      "Wilson opened the tribute to Strait by singing part of his best remembered hit, \u201cAmarillo by Morning.\u201d",
      "She was followed by Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Parker McCollum, Stapleton and Strait contemporary Clint Black, who performed pieces of Strait hits including \u201cTroubadour\u201d and \u201cHonky Tonk Hall of Fame\u201d",
      "Stapleton handed the 72-year-old Strait the award previously won by Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Charley Pride and Nelson himself, calling Strait \u201ctrue country music royalty, the king of country.\u201d",
      "A smiling Strait thanked everyone for the strong renditions of his songs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad I got 'em first,\u201d he said.",
      "The CMA Awards are nominated and voted on by members of the Country Music Association, which includes music executives, artists, publicists, songwriters and other industry professionals."

Jason De Le\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cSoldiers and Kings: Survival and Hope in the World of Human Smuggling\u201d won for nonfiction, where finalists included Salman Rushdie's memoir about his brutal stabbing in 2022, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "The prize for young people's literature was given Wednesday night to Shifa Saltagi Safadi\u2019s coming of age story \u201cKareem Between,\u201d and the poetry award went to Lena Khalaf Tuffaha\u2019s \u201cSomething About Living.\u201d In the translation category, the winner was Y\u00e1ng Shu\u0101ng-z\u01d0\u2019s \u201cTaiwan Travelogue,\u201d translated from the Mandarin Chinese by Lin King.",
      "Judging panels, made up of writers, critics, booksellers and others in the literary community, made their selections from hundreds of submissions, with publishers nominating more than 1,900 books in all. Each of the winners in the five competitive categories received $10,000.",
      "Everett\u2019s win continues his remarkable rise in the past few years. Little known to general readers for decades, the 67-year-old has been a Booker Prize and Pulitzer Prize finalist for such novels as \u201cTrees\u201d and \u201cDr. No\u201d and has seen the novel \u201cErasure\u201d adapted into the Oscar-nominated \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d",
      "In taking on Mark Twain\u2019s classic about the wayward Southern boy Huck and the enslaved Jim, Everett tells the story from the latter's perspective and emphasizes how differently Jim behaves and even speaks when whites are not around. The novel was a Booker finalist and last month won the Kirkus Prize for fiction.",
      "\u201cJames\u201d has been nicely received,\u201d Everett noted during his acceptance speech.",
      "\u201cDemon Copperhead\u201d novelist Barbara Kingsolver and Black Classic Press publisher W. Paul Coates received lifetime achievement medals from the National Book Foundation, which presents the awards.",
      "Speakers praised diversity, disruption and autonomy, whether Taiwanese independence or the rights of immigrants in the U.S. Two winners, Safadi and Tuffaha, condemned the year-old Gaza war and U.S. military support for Israel. Neither mentioned Israel by name, but both called the conflict \u201cgenocide\u201d and were met with cheers \u2014 and more subdued responses \u2014 after calling for support of the Palestinians.",
      "Tuffaha, who is Palestinian American, dedicated her award in part to \u201cto all the deeply beautiful Palestinians that this world has lost and all those miraculous ones who endured, waiting for us, waiting for us to wake up.\u201d",
      "Last year publisher Zibby Owens withdrew support for the awards after hearing that finalists were planning to condemn the Gaza war. This year the World Jewish Congress was among those criticizing Coates\u2019 award, citing in part his reissue of the essay \u201cThe Jewish Onslaught,\u201d which has been called anti-Semitic.",
      "National Book Foundation Executive Director Ruth Dickey said in a recent statement that Coates was being honored for a body of work rather than any individual book, and added that while the foundation condemns anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, it also believes in free expression.",
      "\u201cAnyone examining the work of any publisher, over the course of almost five decades, will find individual works or opinions with which they disagree or find offensive,\u201d she added.",
      "The National Book Awards have long taken place in mid-November, shortly after the elections, and they're an early snapshot of the book world's reaction: Hopeful after Barack Obama's victory in 2008, when publisher and honorary winner Barney Rosset anticipated \u201ca new and uplifting agenda\u201d; grim but determined in 2016, after Donald Trump's first victory, with fiction winner Colson Whitehead urging the audience to \u201cbe kind to everybody, make art, and fight the power.\u201d",
      "This year, as hundreds gathered for the dinner ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan for the awards' 75th anniversary, the mood was one of sobriety, resolve and willed good cheer.",
      "Host Kate McKinnon joked that she was recruited because the National Book Foundation wanted \u201csomething fun and light and to distract from the fact that the world is a bonfire.\u201d Musical guest Jon Batiste led the audience in a round of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d and sang a few lines from \u201cHallelujah,\u201d the Leonard Cohen standard which McKinnon somberly performed at the start of the first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after the 2016 election.",
      "Kingsolver acknowledged feeling \u201csmacked down, at the moment,\u201d but added that she has known despair before.

The writer's job is to imagine \u201ca better ending than the one we've been given,\" she said.",
      "At a Tuesday night reading by awards finalists, some spoke of community and support.

    "story": [
      "When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted",
      "NEW YORK -- When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted.",
      "Cole, one of the most important chroniclers of apartheid-era South Africa, was by then mostly forgotten and penniless. Banned by his native country after the publication of his pioneering photography book \u201cHouse of Bondage,\u201d Cole had emigrated in 1966 to the United States. But his life in exile gradually disintegrated into intermittent homelessness. A six-paragraph obituary in The New York Times ran alongside a list of death notices.",
      "But Cole receives a vibrant and stirring resurrection in Raoul Peck\u2019s new film \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d narrated in Cole\u2019s own words and voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, is laced throughout with Cole\u2019s photographs, many of them not before seen publicly.",
      "As he did in his Oscar-nominated James Baldwin documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d the Haitian-born Peck shares screenwriting credit with his subject. \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is drawn from Cole\u2019s own writings. In words and images, Peck brings the tragic story of Cole to vivid life, reopening the lens through which Cole so perceptively saw injustice and humanity.",
      "\u201cFilm is a political tool for me,\u201d Peck said in a recent interview over lunch in Manhattan. \u201cMy job is to go to the widest audience possible and try to give them something to help them understand where they are, what they are doing, what role they are playing. It\u2019s about my fight today. I don\u2019t care about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is a movie layered with meaning that goes beyond Cole\u2019s work. It asks questions not just about the societies Cole documented but of how he was treated as an artist, drawing uncomfortable parallels between apartheid and post-Jim Crow America. In the U.S., Cole was given a Ford Foundation grant to capture Black life in rural and urban areas, but he struggled to find a foothold professionally. Some editors said his images lacked \u201cedge.\u201d",
      "In 2017, more than 60,000 of Cole\u2019s 35mm film negatives were discovered in a bank vault in Stockholm, Sweden. Much of that material, including thousands of photographs Cole took in the U.S., was believed lost. Answers for how they had gotten there, and why they hadn't been known about earlier were hard to come by. \u201cLost and Found\u201d portrays the struggle of Cole's estate to acquire the collection. Only on the eve of the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere in May did the bank finally announce the handover of most materials to the estate.",
      "What those photographs reveal is an artist who made much more than indelible images of apartheid life. Cole\u2019s early photographs, published in 1967, offered one of the most illustrative and damning portraits of apartheid to Western eyes, including a widely reproduced photograph of a middle-aged woman sitting on a park bench that read \u201cEuropean\u2019s only.\u201d But he was an equally astute and sensitive observer of the segregations, and multicultural joys, of American life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d Stanfield narrates as Cole. \u201cSteal every moment.\u201d",
      "For Peck, the themes of \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d are deeply personal. The 71-year-old filmmaker, a former minister of culture in Haiti, has spent much of his artistic life also away from his native country, in Berlin, Paris and New York. He dedicates the movie \u201cto those who died in exile.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I say that, that\u2019s most of my friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI recognize all the steps. When you take a contact sheet, I see myself.\u201d",
      "For some four decades, Peck has made some of the most urgent films, in both fiction (including 2000\u2019s \u201cLumumba,\u201d about the exiled Congo leader) and non-fiction (including last year\u2019s \u201cSilver Dollar Road\u201d ). But he has rarely not employed both narrative and documentary elements in films that take their own shape \u2014 movies less interested in genre distinctions than they are pursuing unexamined truths.",
      "That\u2019s made Peck an increasingly exceptional figure in a documentary world that\u2019s become more and more dominated by glossier, less probing films for streaming platforms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse. There\u2019s less money so young people are desperate and accept stuff that my generation would never accept,\u201d Peck says. \u201cThe whole industry has changed. I knew another world, and I recognize it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d",
      "Peck is currently editing a documentary on George Orwell. Like \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d it will be told totally in Orwell\u2019s words. A few days after the U.S. election, Peck was working to update a moment in the film that touches on President-elect Donald Trump. Peck has been astonished at how prescient Orwell was on so many current issues \u2014 misinformation, AI, social media, the refugee crisis.",
      "\u201cHe was a really incredible critic of history and how history is even told,\u201d says Peck. \u201cBefore plunging into it, I did not realize how sharp he was about what\u2019s going on today.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me,\u201d he adds, \u201ca film has value if it\u2019s talking to us today.\u201d"

      "Two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their names \u2014 MSNBC and CNBC \u2014 will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News once a spinoff formally takes effect in about a year",
      "Comcast's corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News.",
      "How that affects viewers of those networks, along with the people who work there, still needs to shake out. Their new corporate leader, Mark Lazarus, visited the set of MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as the plan was being announced on Wednesday and spoke to network staff members during a morning conference call to address concerns.",
      "Comcast is spinning off most of its cable networks, also including USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel, into a separate company. That recognizes how streaming is considered the future and the cable networks are a drag on the bottom line.",
      "In the space of a lifetime, the networks went from upstarts aside a legacy operation like NBC to profitable superstars to castoffs.",
      "Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Universal Media Group, is becoming CEO of the newly-formed company of cable networks, temporarily dubbed \u201cSpinCo.\u201d Cesar Conde, who as NBC Universal News Group chairman had oversight of CNBC and MSNBC, will lose those networks from his portfolio, yet remain in charge of NBC News, NBC News Now streaming, Telemundo and the news operations of the NBC-owned local stations.",
      "The presence of Lazarus and Anand Kini, who will be chief operating officer and chief financial officer of SpinCo, is a good sign for the new company, said Jessica Reif Ehrlich, research analyst for the Bank of America. \u201cYou can't dismiss it as getting rid of the crappy assets, because these are talented executives,\u201d she said.",
      "At MSNBC, questions about the future range from the simple \u2014 will it even keep its name? \u2014 to the complex.",
      "MSNBC's staff and studios are based in the same Rockefeller Center offices as NBC News, and it was unclear on Wednesday whether they will remain or move elsewhere, Lazarus told MSNBC employees.",
      "MSNBC's relationship with NBC News has caused some awkwardness, particularly as the network has become known for its stable of liberal commentators while still attached to a news division that stresses impartiality. For much of MSNBC's broadcast day, NBC News journalists like Katy Tur, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chris Jansing and a host of reporters appear on the network.",
      "It's unclear whether arrangements could be made for that cross-pollination to continue \u2014 where will Steve Kornacki land, for example? \u2014 or if MSNBC will bear the expense of building out its own newsgathering operation or lean more heavily into commentary.",
      "It's a nervous time at MSNBC for other reasons. The network has seen a dramatic drop in viewership since Donald Trump's election victory, although it is common that news networks that appeal primarily to one side of a political divide lose viewers when their candidates are defeated. History shows most viewers return, and MSNBC executives anticipate that.",
      "Less clear is whether a second Trump administration will make life difficult. Trump ally Steve Bannon, on his radio show last week, sent out a specific warning to the network's anchors and producers. \u201cYou better be worried,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better lawyer up.\u201d",
      "CNBC launched in 1989, while MSNBC started in 1996. They have seemed inextricably bound with the broadcast network since, and the sharing of legal, promotional, technical and other support is something else that needs to be worked out.",
      "With its financial concentration, CNBC has been more independent of NBC News than its cable brethren. With offices in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., its operation is even physically separate. However, NBC News often taps CNBC reporters for their business expertise on broadcast and its streaming service.",
      "\u201cI completely empathize with people who think this would be a bittersweet thing,\u201d Lazarus said, according to MSNBC. \u201cI think it's exciting because very few times in life you get to have the opportunity to be part of what I'll call a \u2018well-funded startup.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the old-school nature of a company of cable properties, Comcast executives are bullish on its prospects, noting that many of them produce profits individually. And there's the potential for buying other networks undervalued by big media companies.",
      "Andrew Ross Sorkin, host of CNBC's \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday that the two cable news networks produce \u201dextraordinary profits\" for Comcast that are not being reinvested in cable properties.",
      "\"If you could take that money that's coming off of these channels and invest in the businesses as an independent entity, what will that ultimately look like\"?\" Sorkin asked. \u201cCould you use that money to go make other acquisitions? Could you make investments in the business itself? That's the big question.\u201d",
      "One piece of advice from Bank of America's Ehrlich: Keep the names. \u201cThose are pretty big brand names,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not advise them to change.\u201d",

      "The Illinois Supreme Court has overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lied to Chicago police",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in downtown Chicago in 2019 and lied to police was overturned Thursday over prosecutorial issues in an Illinois Supreme Court decision that did not address his claim of innocence.",
      "The state's highest court found that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the Cook County state\u2019s attorney initially dropped charges against Smollett in exchange for him forfeiting his $10,000 bond and conducting community service.",
      "Smollett, who is Black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him, spouted racial and homophobic slurs and tossed a noose around his neck, leading to a massive search for suspects by Chicago police detectives and kicking up an international uproar. Smollett was on the television drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio\u2019s response to hate mail he received.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\u201d Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the court's 5-0 opinion. \u201cNevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\u201d",
      "Smollett\u2019s attorneys argued that the case was over when Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped an initial 16 counts of disorderly conduct. The deal prompted immediate backlash, with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it \u201ca whitewash of justice.\u201d A special prosecutor was appointed, and a grand jury restored charges, leading to Smollett's 2021 conviction on five counts of disorderly conduct.",
      "\u201cThis was not a prosecution based on facts, rather it was a vindictive persecution and such a proceeding has no place in our criminal justice system,\" Smollett's attorney, Nenye Uche, said in a statement. Uche said \u201crule of law was the big winner today\u201d and thanked the court for \"restoring order to Illinois\u2019 criminal law jurisprudence.\u201d",
      "The special prosecutor, Dan Webb, said he disagreed with the court's ruling while noting that it \u201chas nothing to do with Mr. Smollett\u2019s innocence.\u201d",
      "\"The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct,\" Webb said.",
      "A spokesperson said Foxx would be available to comment later Thursday. Eileen O\u2019Neill Burke, the incoming Cook County state's attorney who was elected this month to replace Foxx after she decided not to seek a third term, declined to comment.",
      "Testimony at trial indicated Smollett paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from \u201cEmpire\u201d to carry out the attack. Prosecutors said he told them what slurs to shout, and to yell that Smollett was in \u201cMAGA country,\u201d an apparent reference to the Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign slogan.",
      "Smollett testified that \u201cthere was no hoax\u201d and that he was the victim of a hate crime in his downtown Chicago neighborhood.",
      "He was sentenced to 150 days in jail \u2014 six of which he served before he was freed pending appeal \u2014 and was ordered to pay about $130,000 in restitution.",
      "Webb noted that Chicago officials can still pursue their civil case against Smollett that seeks to recoup the $130,000, the amount police say they paid in overtime to pursue Smollett's accusations.",
      "Smollett, a child actor who appeared in 1992 movie \u201cThe Mighty Ducks,\u201d has credited his role as a singer on the hip-hop drama \u201cEmpire\u201d for turbocharging his career. This year, he starred in the movie \u201cThe Lost Holliday\u201d with Vivica A. Fox.",

      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is clearly prizing experience on television as he chooses people to serve in his new administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- There's a common trait that President-elect Donald Trump is clearly prizing as he selects those to serve in his new administration: experience on television.",
      "Trump loves that \"central casting\" look, as he likes to call it.",
      "Some, like his choices for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, were until recently TV hosts on Trump's favorite network, Fox News. Mike Huckabee, his pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, hosted the Fox show \u201cHuckabee\u201d from 2008 to 2015 after his time as Arkansas governor.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former syndicated talk show host and heart surgeon, was tapped Tuesday to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees health insurance programs for millions of older, poor and disabled Americans. He would report to Trump's choice for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., himself a regular on the cable news circuit.",
      "Trump, a former reality television star himself, has made no secret of his intention to stack his administration with loyalists after his decisive 2024 election win \u2014 including some whose lack of relevant experience has raised concerns among lawmakers. But he's also working to set up a more forceful administration in this term, and in his eyes, many of those people happen to intersect with celebrity.",
      "The trend was not lost on Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, who posted on social media after the Oz nomination: \u201cWe are becoming the world\u2019s first nuclear-armed reality television show.\u201d",
      "For good measure, Himes added: \u201cJust spitballing here, but what if the Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS fight each other in an octagonal cage?\u201d That was a reference to Trump's affinity for the UFC fighters who do battle in the octagon.",
      "Choosing TV personalities isn't that unusual for the once-and-future president: A number of his first-term choices \u2014 John Bolton, Larry Kudlow, Heather Nauert and Mercedes Schlapp, were all on TV \u2014 mostly also on Fox. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a confrontational first-season member of Trump's NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice,\" was briefly at the White House before she was fired.",
      "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who ran Trump\u2019s 2016 transition team until he was fired, said that eight years ago, Trump held \u201cApprentice-like interviews at Bedminster,\u201d summoning potential hires to his club in New Jersey.",
      "On a call on Tuesday organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Christie said this year\u2019s Cabinet choices are different than 2016\u2019s but it\u2019s still \u201cDonald Trump casting a TV show.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s casting,\u201d Christie said.",
      "Trump has readily highlighted the media experience of his choices as he's announced them. He said Duffy, a former lawmaker and onetime cast member of MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World,\" was \u201ca STAR on Fox News.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, a military veteran, \u201chas been a host at FOX News for eight years, where he used that platform to fight for our Military and Veterans,\u201d Trump said. He also noted that Hegseth's book \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d spent nine weeks on The New York Times \u201cbest-sellers list, including two weeks at NUMBER ONE.\u201d",
      "As for Oz, Trump said: \u201cHe won nine Daytime Emmy Awards hosting \u2018The Dr. Oz Show,\u2019 where he taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.\"",
      "It's also true that those seeking positions in Trump's orbit often take to the airwaves to audition for an audience of one. Tom Homan, Trump's choice for \u201cborder czar,\u201d is a frequent Fox contributor. Ohio Sen. JD Vance was chosen as Trump's running mate in part because of how well he comes across on air.",
      "Trump's choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, upped his profile when he took to Fox News to argue that a pre-election appearance on NBC's \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was a violation of the \u201cequal time\u201d rule governing candidate appearances on television.",
      "The White House-to-cable news pundit pipeline tends to cut across administrations of both parties, to some extent. President Joe Biden had three MSNBC contributors on his transition team and his former press secretary went to the network after she left the White House. Biden, though, looked to career diplomats, longtime government workers and military leaders for key posts like the Defense Department.",
      "Trump's affinity for Fox News is well-documented, though the romance cooled for a time after Fox made an early call of Arizona for Biden in 2020, a move that infuriated Trump and many of the network\u2019s viewers. Trump suggested viewers should migrate to other conservative news outlets.",
      "While the Arizona call ultimately proved correct, it set in motion internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "But Trump is still an avid watcher \u2014 the network provides Trump a window into conservative thinking, with commentary from Republican lawmakers and thinkers who are, often, speaking directly to the president-elect.",

      "NEW YORK -- Pamela Hayden, the longtime voice actor behind Milhouse Van Houten \u2014 Bart Simpson's very uncool friend \u2014 is stepping away after 35 years of whining.",
      "Hayden, 70, who voiced Milhouse, Jimbo Jones, Rod Flanders, Janey and Malibu Stacy, will sign off from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d on Nov. 24 in a \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d episode.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and a joy to have worked on such a funny, witty, and groundbreaking show,\u201d Hayden said in a statement.",
      "\u201cPamela gave us tons of laughs with Milhouse, the hapless kid with the biggest nose in Springfield. She made Milhouse hilarious and real, and we will miss her,\u201d said \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d creator Matt Groening.",
      "Casting for her characters is planned.",
      "Milhouse first appeared in a Butterfinger commercial in 1989 and was named for the former U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon. Groening said he adopted it \"because that was the most unfortunate name a kid could have.\u201d",
      "The nearsighted character was often the butt of most jokes and bullied mercilessly by Nelson. In one episode, Bart got Milhouse placed on the America\u2019s Most Wanted list, but in another he traded Bart's soul to the guy at the comic book store."

      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture. But, more than a year later, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make \u201cGlicked\u201d \u2014 or even \u201cBabyratu\u201d \u2014 happen.",
      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "\u201cComedian,\u201d by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point, another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it.",
      "The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.",
      "Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby\u2019s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it \u201cComedian.\u201d",
      "The piece attracted heavy attention at the busy auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana.",
      "Bidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked \u201cDon't let it slip away.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity,\" Barker said. \u201cThese are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana.\u201d",
      "The final hammer price announced in the room was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.",
      "In a statement, Sun said the piece \u201crepresents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.\u201d But he said the latest version of \u201cComedian\" won't last long.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s calls Cattelan \u201camong Contemporary Art\u2019s most brilliant provocateurs.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has persistently disrupted the art world\u2019s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways,\u201d the auction house said in a description of \u201cComedian.\u201d",
      "The sale came a day after a painting by the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte sold for $121.2 million, a record for the artist, at a separate auction.",
      "\u201cThe Empire of Light,\u201d an eerie nighttime streetscape below a pale blue daytime sky, sold Tuesday as part of Christie\u2019s sale of the collection of interior designer Mica Ertegun, who died last year at age 97.",
      "The sale lifts Magritte into the ranks of artists whose works have gone for more than $100 million at auction. Magritte is the 16th member of the club, which also includes Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, according to the market analyst firm Artprice.",
      "\u201cThe Empire of Light,\u201d executed in 1954, was one of 17 versions of the same scene that Magritte painted in oil. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, called the sale \u201ca historic moment in our saleroom.\u201d",
      "The $121.2 million price included the auction house\u2019s fees. The buyer was a telephone bidder whose identity was not disclosed."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:26:27 -0500",
    "summary": "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

    "summary": "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
    "story": [
      "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

      "Wednesday is Transgender Day of Remembrance, which focuses on trans people who have lost their lives because of violence. Here is what to know.",
      "Transgender Day of Remembrance is marked every Nov. 20 and began in 1999 to honor Rita Hester, a trans woman who was killed in Massachusetts.",
      "The day marks the end of Transgender Awareness Week, which is used to raise public knowledge about transgender people and the issues they face.",
      "The Williams Institute at UCLA Law estimates that 1.6 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older identify as transgender. And it says transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violence, including rape and assault.",
      "Candlelight vigils, memorials and other events are held to mark the day. The Human Rights Campaign also released its annual report on deaths of transgender people in conjunction with the day.",
      "International Transgender Day of Visibility, which is designed to bring attention to transgender people, is commemorated in March.",
      "At least 36 transgender people have died from violence in the 12 months since the last Day of Remembrance, the Human Rights Campaign said in its annual report. Since 2013, the organization has recorded the deaths from violence of 372 victims who were transgender and gender-expansive \u2014 which refers to someone with a more flexible range of gender identity or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system.",
      "The number of victims is likely higher because many deaths often aren't reported or are misreported, or misgendering of the victims leads to delays in their identification.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign said there was a slight increase from the previous year, when it identified at least 33 transgender victims of violence.",
      "A large number of the victims tracked over the past year were young or people of color, with Black transgender women making up half of the 36 identified. The youngest victim identified was 14-year-old Pauly Likens of Pennsylvania.",
      "Two-thirds of the fatalities involved a firearm, the organization said. Nearly a third of the victims with a known killer were killed by an intimate partner, a friend or a family member.",
      "This year\u2019s remembrance follows an election where advocates say victories by President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican candidates who focused on issues like transgender athletes dealt a setback to trans people\u2019s rights.",
      "It also follows a wave of measures enacted in Republican states this year restricting the rights of transgender people, especially youth.",
      "Half the states have banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a lawsuit challenging Tennessee's ban.",
      "Advocates say the legislation and rhetoric is creating fewer safe spaces for transgender people, and they worry it could spur more violence against trans people.",

      "Hamid Jafari, the WHO director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said last week the forced repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan was a major setback to polio eradication and has led to a \u201cmassive and unpredictable movement\u201d of people within the two countries and across borders.",

Period. I am not equivocating, and I have not equivocated about that. The way to solve this is through legislation.\"",
      "A bill to end casino smoking has been stalled in the state Legislature for years without the state's Democratic leadership allowing it to progress to full votes in the Senate and Assembly.",

      "A competing bill that would keep the current 25% limit of the casino floor on which smoking can occur, but impose other limits is also bottled up in the Legislature.",
      "That measure would allow smoking in unenclosed areas of the casino floor that contain slot machines and are designated as smoking areas that are more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from table games staffed by live dealers. It also would allow the casinos to offer smoking in enclosed, separately ventilated smoking rooms with the proviso that no worker can be assigned to work in such a room against their will.",
      "Ricky Foster, a supervisor-dealer at the Borgata for 21 years, said the frustration among workers is palpable.",

      "Experts say people shopping for health insurance right now should look beyond price when searching for coverage for next year",

      "Shoppers also should consider doctor networks and coverage limits to avoid getting stuck with big bills after care.",
      "Millions of Americans are looking for 2025 coverage now during annual enrollment windows for Medicare Advantage plans and individual insurance. Plus, many employers are telling their workers about their coverage plans for next year too.",
      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",
      "This is the annual amount a patient pays for many covered services before the insurer starts paying a portion of the bill. Plans with low premiums can come with deductibles well over $1,000 for individuals and a few thousand dollars for families.",
      "Shoppers should look at the size of the individual deductible and understand where it applies. Regular visits to a specialist can lead to some hefty patient bills.",
      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",
      "The federal government\u2019s website for finding insurance plans makes it easy to filter for covered doctors and hospitals when looking for plans, said Emily Bremer, president of a St. Louis-based independent insurance agency, The Bremer Group.",
      "Bremer says shoppers should think about more than whether their doctors are in the network. They also should also consider which hospital system they would want to visit if a big emergency happens.",
      "Insurance plans come with formularies, or lists of covered drugs, that vary by plan. Those lists often group drugs in tiers with different costs for the patient.",
      "Shoppers should check to see how a plan will cover the regular prescriptions they already take.",
      "Don\u2019t immediately rule out the plan if the bill would be too high. Help may be available. Drugmakers often have coupons or discount programs that can cover patient costs as long as the drug has coverage, Bremer said. Websites like GoodRx also may be an option for getting a price break.",
      "\u201cIf you take a lot of stuff and see a lot of doctors \u2026 it can be really hard to find one perfect plan that\u2019s going to cover everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have to make choices.\u201d",
      "This is the portion of a bill the patient is responsible for after meeting the deductible. It\u2019s a percentage that can vary. Usually plans with lower premiums leave patients with bigger coinsurance.",
      "Coinsurance payments can hurt, so it\u2019s important to know the percentage and the risk you face.",
      "For instance, a childbirth by cesarean section may generate a $25,000 bill. A patient responsible for a $1,000 deductible and then 20% of the remaining bill through coinsurance could pay $5,800 of that total.",
      "\u201cMost people will focus on the deductible and forget about the coinsurance, and they should not,\u201d Bremer said. \u201c(It) can really sneak up on you when you have a large claim.\u201d",
      "People with low incomes may qualify for help with some of these out-of-pocket expenses through cost-sharing reductions found in the ACA marketplaces.",
      "Health insurers will start handling all costs for covered, in-network care once you reach a plan\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum for patient spending. That can vary by plan.",
      "For coverage sold on the ACA marketplace, that annual maximum cannot be more than $9,200 for individuals and $18,400 for families next year.",
      "Those who reach this level of spending may only see temporary relief. Patient spending totals that count toward that out-of-pocket maximum generally reset at the start of every calendar year or if you switch plans during the year.",

      "The final 131-page measure, which also includes setting aside additional funds for Hurricane Helene relief, became public roughly an hour before the GOP-controlled House met to debate it during a lame-duck General Assembly session this week. The House voted largely along party lines Tuesday night for the measure, which the Republican-controlled Senate was expected to take up on Wednesday.",
      "With Republicans likely to lose their veto-proof majority in the next two-year session following electoral losses in the House, this week could be the last best chance for them to enact legislation containing sharp partisan changes. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper leaves office at year's end and will be succeeded by Democrat Josh Stein.",
      "Currently the State Board of Elections' five members are appointed by the governor based on recommendations by the Democratic and Republican parties. The governor's party always holds three of the seats. Republican legislators have tried for years to wrest away those appointment powers but have been thwarted by courts. Judges have blocked for now a 2023 law that would move board appointment authority from the governor to the General Assembly.",
      "Even with litigation pending, Tuesday's measure would move the independent state board to the State Auditor's Office starting next summer. At that time the new auditor \u2014 Republican Dave Boliek, who was elected this month \u2014 would make appointments. These changes likely would mean Republican control of the board.",
      "In a likely response to complaints about slow vote-counting this month, the bill also would require in 2025 that county election boards count all provisional ballots by three days after Election Day.",
      "Some counties did not complete this year's provisional ballot count until days after last Friday's canvassing date. The measure also would move up the deadline by which some people who lack a photo identification card while voting must show they have one for their ballot to count.",

      "Tuesday\u2019s bill contains additional Helene-related provisions and locates an additional $227 million from the state\u2019s reserves but orders the money to remain unspent for now. It does give $50 million more to help Cooper\u2019s administration address a shortfall to complete housing projects still left over from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.",
      "State lawmakers previously set aside over $900 million toward Helene relief and recovery in two measures approved this fall and signed by Cooper. Cooper has asked for legislators to provide much more, and quickly.",
      "Democrats from western North Carolina said Republicans were more interested in power grabs than helping businesses and residents damaged by Helene. Republicans used a procedure by which Democrats could not offer amendments.",
      "\u201cThis bill makes it pretty clear that the body is prioritizing political priorities over the very real need for rapid assistance in the western part of our state,\u201d Buncombe County Rep. Eric Ager said. Three Republicans from the west ended up voting no on the bill \u2014 a development that could scuttle a potential Cooper override.",
      "Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican who only handled the spending provisions, said lawmakers are receiving Helene spending requests daily.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work still that needs to be done ... and still, quite frankly, a lot of money that\u2019s going to have to be spent,\u201d Lambeth said.",
      "The legislation also would immediately weaken the governor's authority to fill vacancies on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court by limiting choices to three candidates offered by the political party of the outgoing justice or judge.",
      "Stein, who is currently attorney general, is being succeeded by fellow Democrat Jeff Jackson. The bill would limit the attorney general in part by barring him in litigation that challenges a law's validity from taking legal positions contrary to the General Assembly. Stein has recently declined to defend in court portions of laws that restrict surgical abortions and abortion pills.",
      "\u201cInstead of stepping up, the Republicans in the General Assembly are grabbing power and exacting political retribution,\u201d Stein said Tuesday on the social platform X.",
      "And the bill also will prevent the superintendent of public instruction \u2014 a post that is switching party control in January, to Democrat Mo Green \u2014 would now be barred from appealing decisions by a state board that reviews charter school applications.",
      "The Republican attempt to erode Democrats' powers recalls similar measures passed in late 2016 that were designed to weaken Cooper, who was about to succeed Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. Those bills led to loud demonstrations in the Legislative Building and dozens of arrests.",

      "The reason? A recent federal judge\u2019s decision that ordered U.S. regulators to consider the risk that fluoride in water could cause lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to look at and just say \u2018Ah, screw it. We\u2019ll keep going on,\u2019\u201d said the town supervisor, Ed Lachterman.",
      "Yorktown isn\u2019t alone. The decision to add fluoride to drinking water rests with state and local officials, and fights are cropping up nationwide.",
      "Communities in Florida, Texas, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and elsewhere have debated the idea in recent months \u2014 the total number is in the dozens, with several deciding to stop adding it to drinking water, according to Fluoride Action Network, an advocacy organization against water fluoridation. In Arkansas, legislators this week filed a bill to repeal the state\u2019s fluoridation program.",
      "The debates have been ignited or fueled by three developments:",
      "\u2014In August, a federal agency reported \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure \u2014 more than twice the recommended limit \u2014 and lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u2014In September, the federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.",
      "\u2014This month, just days before the election, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared that Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day as president. Trump later picked Kennedy to run the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In Durango, Colorado, there was an unsuccessful attempt to stop fluoridating the water during Trump\u2019s first term in office. A new push came this year, as Trump saw a surge of political support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of the ebb and flow of politics on the national level that ultimately affects us down here,\u201d said city spokesman Tom Sluis.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and the addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data.",
      "There is a recommended fluoridation level, but many communities exceed that, sometimes because fluoride occurs naturally at higher levels in certain water sources.",
      "Opposition is nothing new, though for decades it was considered a fringe opinion. Adherents included conspiracy theorists who claimed fluoridation was a plot to make people submissive to government power.",
      "Health officials could point to studies that showed that cavities were less common in communities with fluoridated water, and that dental health worsened in communities without it.",
      "But fluoride isn't just in water. Through the years it became common in toothpaste, mouthwash and other products. And data began to emerge that there could be too much of a good thing: In 2011, officials reported that 2 out of 5 U.S. adolescents had at least mild tooth streaking or spottiness because of too much fluoride.",
      "In 2015, the CDC recommended that communities revisit how much they were putting in the water. Beginning in 1962, the government recommended a range of 0.7 milligrams per liter for warmer climates where people drink more water to 1.2 milligrams in cooler areas. The new standard became 0.7 everywhere.",
      "Over time, more studies pointed to a different problem: a link between higher levels of fluoride and brain development. The August report by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program \u2014 summarizing studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico \u2014 concluded that drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter was associated with lower IQs in kids.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that fluoride prevents cavities,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the CDC when the agency changed the recommended fluoride levels. \u201cThere\u2019s also no question we\u2019re getting more fluoride than we were 50 years ago, through toothpaste and other things.\u201d",
      "Frieden said \u201ca legitimate question\u201d has been raised about whether fluoride affects brain development, and studies making that link \u201cneed to be looked at carefully.\u201d",
      "Many people in health care strongly embrace water fluoridation. The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed their endorsement of current CDC recommendations in the wake of the federal report and the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "Colorado\u2019s health department, which weighed in during a Nov. 5 Durango city council meeting, said in a statement that it \u201cseeks to align its public health recommendations with the latest scientific research. The facts of this court ruling are not sufficient\u201d to revise current fluoridation levels.",
      "Durango officials are waiting to see what the EPA does in reaction to the recent court decision, said Sluis, the city spokesman.",
      "\u201cWe follow the science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be in the best interest of the city to stop fluoridation based on one judge\u2019s interpretation.\u201d",
      "In Yorktown, Lachterman concluded the judge\u2019s decision was enough to halt fluoridation. He recalled a community discussion several years ago in which most people in the room clearly favored fluoridation, but recently it seems public comment has reversed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a total 180,\u201d he said.",
      "But not all public pressure these days is against the idea.",
      "In September, Buffalo, New York, announced it would resume water fluoridation after not having it for nearly a decade. News reports had described an increase in tooth decay and families sued, seeking damages for dental costs.",
      "The Buffalo Sewer Authority\u2019s general manager, Oluwole McFoy declined to discuss the decision with The Associated Press, citing the litigation.",
      "For its part, the EPA \u201cis in the process of reviewing the district court\u2019s decision,\u201d spokesman Jeff Landis said this week.",
      "In Monroe, Wisconsin, fluoridation \u201chas become a very hot issue,\u201d said its mayor, Donna Douglas.",
      "The small city, near Madison, started fluoridating its drinking water in the early 1960s. But in the late summer, some residents began calling and emailing Douglas, saying she needed to do something about what they saw as a public health danger. The first call \u201cwas more like a threat,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Douglas said she did not take a position on whether to stop, but decided to raise it to the city council for discussion. The discussions were unusually emotional.",
      "Few people tend to speak during public comment sessions at council meetings, said Douglas. But more than two dozen people spoke at a city council meeting last month, most of them in favor of fluoridation. At a subsequent meeting, about a dozen more people \u2014 all opposed to fluoridation \u2014 came out to speak.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had any debates at all\u201d like this, Douglas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be such a heated discussion.\u201d",

      "Mashal Husain, chief operating officer of The World Food Prize Foundation, will become president, replacing Terry Branstad, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa governor, who will retire, the organization announced in a news release.",
      "The food prize was founded by Normal Borlaug, an Iowa native awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his part in the \u201cGreen Revolution,\u201d which dramatically increased agricultural production and reduced the threat of starvation in much of the world.",
      "Husain, who was born in Pakistan and later lived in Tanzania, Thailand and the Philippines, said her international background was in keeping with Borlaug's work and the foundation's efforts to expand its efforts in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. She has worked at the foundation for 16 years.",
      "\u201cI grew up all over the world and many of these places are places where Normal Borlaug spent a lot of his time, so I feel a deep connection to him,\u201d Husain said in an interview. \u201cHaving lived all over the world, I've witnessed poverty and hunger. I've been surrounded by it since I was a little girl.\u201d",
      "As part of an effort to expand its efforts in other countries, the foundation has created a new chief executive position. The new hire will, among other duties, enhance connections with international leaders in agriculture, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.",
      "The organization also has been focusing more on youth education efforts in which high school students, teachers and food experts study global hunger and food security issues. Events have been held in 24 states as well as The Netherlands and Honduras.",
      "Each spring, the World Food Prize awards a $500,000 prize to someone who has helped food security. This year, Cary Fowler and Geoffrey Hawtin split the prize for their work to create a global seed vault built into the side of a mountain in Norway.",
      "The prizewinners speak in the fall at a weeklong gathering of lectures, meetings and networking in Des Moines.",
      "The foundation's work comes as some people are more skeptical about issues surrounding science and food production, but Husain said their work would hew to Borlaug's belief in innovation and promoting big ideas.",
      "\u201cWorld hunger is not a political issue. It's a moral right,\u201d Husain said. \u201cDr. Borlaug always said food is the moral right of those who are born into this world.\u201d"

      "Mehmet Oz, a celebrity heart surgeon turned talk show host and lifestyle guru, is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the massive federal health care bureaucracy that covers more than a third of Americans.",
      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",
      "The program aired for 13 seasons and made Oz a household name.",
      "Oz stopped doing surgeries in 2018 but his physician license remains active in Pennsylvania through the end of this year, according to the state's online database.",
      "Oz is an author of New York Times bestsellers, an Emmy-winning TV show host, radio talk show host, presidential appointee, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.",
      "He also guest hosted the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d game show and helped save a dying man at Newark Liberty International Airport.",
      "Oz was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a heart surgeon who emigrated from Turkey.",
      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show. Several of the companies he has promoted are structured as multilevel marketing businesses whose practices have repeatedly drawn the attention of federal regulators.",
      "Oz had a net worth between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed in 2022, which gives dollar values in ranges but does not provide specific figures.",
      "Oz ran for U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2022, one of the highest-profile races of that year's midterms. Though he was a longtime resident of New Jersey and worked in New York City, Oz ran in Pennsylvania, citing ties to the state through his wife's parents.",
      "His campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity. Its logo looked just like his TV show logo. His themes \u2014 \u201ca dose of reality\u201d or \u201cthe doctor is in\u201d \u2014 spun off his TV doctor reputation.",
      "He ran in a crowded Republican primary and won Trump's eagerly sought endorsement.",
      "\u201cWomen, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\u201d Trump said when he endorsed Oz.",
      "Following a court battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Oz narrowly won the primary over McCormick by 951 votes but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.",
      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "In a 2016 appearance on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, was \u201ca big fan\u201d of the show.",
      "Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during his first term.",

      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring Thanksgiving tradition for many experienced runners and novices alike",
      "Thanksgiving morning is often a blur of last-minute meal preparation and frenzied chores. But for Beth Thomas, who typically hosts her family at her Boston-area home, most of the work in the kitchen is already done.",
      "Instead, she laces up her sneakers and warms up for a 5K Turkey Trot run with her two sons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing for us to do, knowing probably seven hours later, everyone\u2019s going to be passed out on the couch after having overindulged appropriately. It\u2019s a high point for us to be out there,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWhy not start the day doing something that we really love and then eat a lot of good food later?\u201d",
      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring tradition for many people on and around Thanksgiving. There are thousands of races, ranging from about 1 mile to a full marathon.",
      "Run Signup, a platform where runners can register and fundraise for races, calls Thanksgiving \u201cthe biggest US running day of the year.\u201d More and more people are joining in, it said; 2023 saw the highest number of turkey trotters ever registered on the site, with almost 1 million runners across the country.",
      "Some do it for fitness, others for family and community, and many are also raising money for charities. The races attract both novices and serious runners.",
      "There are also Turkey Trots that go by other names: Gobble Wobbles, Drumstick Dashes and Huffing for Stuffings. While most races are held on Thanksgiving Day, some take place the weekend before or after.",
      "Thomas and her sons have run in Thanksgiving races for several years. Sometimes other relatives join them. Still others cheer them on from the sidelines.",
      "Thanksgiving exercise events are by no means a novel idea. Just ask the 14,000 participants in the upcoming Turkey Trot in Buffalo, New York, which will be the local YMCA\u2019s 129th annual race.",
      "Mike Baggerman, the communications director at the YMCA Buffalo Niagara, said Buffalo\u2019s race \u2014 officially a year older than the Boston Marathon \u2014 has become a hallmark for the community.",

      "Children and people who use wheelchairs are frequent participants, Baggerman said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most memorable races,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun run.\u201d",
      "Many beginning runners train in the weeks and months leading up to Thanksgiving to compete in a Turkey Trot. Even for those who don\u2019t run regularly, the jolt of activity \u2014 perhaps a mix of walking and running \u2014 can feel good.",
      "Prioritizing exercise and movement during a week when many have long to-do lists and multiple stressors is often difficult, said dietician and Michigan-based fitness instructor Casey Young. To her, Thanksgiving races can not only help people reach their physical activity goals but also help stabilize their mood and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cHolidays tend to be such a stressful time for a lot of people, and sometimes people are traveling, and that can add some additional stress and get you out of your typical routine,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo, anytime we have an opportunity to move our body is a positive thing.\u201d",
      "Exercise may prompt people to be \u201cmore mindful and intentional\u201d when plating up later, Young said, but she warns against the mentality that the purpose of the exertion is to earn a decadent Thanksgiving meal or to burn it off afterward. That could foster an \u201cunhealthy relationship with food.\u201d",
      "Turkey trotters should instead emphasize the physical activity and its health benefits, she said.",
      "Beyond the physical and mental benefits, many turkey trotters lean into the holiday\u2019s spirit of thankfulness and giving back.",
      "Some of the races are organized as fundraisers in partnership with local organizations. Registration fees for participants and donations on their behalf often benefit causes like food banks, homeless shelters and community programs.",
      "Baggerman said the Buffalo Niagara YMCA\u2019s turkey trot is the organization\u2019s largest fundraiser of the year, raising money for affordable childcare, community classes, health and wellness programs, and efforts to combat food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a fun 5-mile run on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s something that helps the YMCA achieve its mission, which is to strengthen the western New York community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Buffalo people to step up every single year and sell this race out at 14,000, it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d"

      "Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants to settle a federal lawsuit filed over defendants waiting months for evaluations of whether they were fit for a trial.",
      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

He was arrested in 2020 in a political crackdown following massive anti-government protests in 2019. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "The testimony highlighted WhatsApp conversations between Lai and Apple Daily\u2019s ex-associate publisher Chan Pui-man.

      "Lai said Thursday he did not write that message and had just copied and pasted the text he received from a person he suspected was connected with the White House. He said he did not read the full text thoroughly before forwarding it. He said the text \"sounds so foreign to me.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:34:18 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,500 migrants have formed a new caravan in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border",
    "story": [
      "About 1,500 migrants have formed a new caravan in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border",
      "TAPACHULA, Mexico -- About 1,500 migrants formed a new caravan Wednesday in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border. The migrants are mainly from Central and South America. Some say they are hoping to reach the United States before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, saying they think it might be more difficult after that. They started out walking from the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, where thousands of migrants are stranded because they do not have permission to cross further into Mexico.",
      "Migrant caravans began forming in 2018, and they became a final, desperate hope for poorer migrants who do not have the money to pay smugglers. If migrants try to cross Mexico alone or in small groups, they are often either detained by authorities and sent back to southern Mexico, or worse, deported back to their home countries. In that sense, there is safety in numbers: it is hard or impossible for immigration agents to detain groups of hundreds of migrants. So police and immigration agents often try to pick off smaller groups, and wait for the main body of the caravan to tire itself out. Usually the caravans stop or fall apart within 150 miles (250 kilometers).",
      "There is no safety in numbers, however, against threats, extortion or abduction by drug cartels in Mexico, which have become heavily involved in migrant trafficking. The cartels charge migrants or their smugglers for permission to cross their territories along the border. In addition, the gangs often kidnap migrants, hold them in terrible conditions or torture them until they call relatives to send money for their release. The biggest obstacle, though, is the searing heat, dehydration and distance: it is over 1,100 miles (1,780 kilometers) from Tapachula to the nearest border crossing at Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. And that is the shortest, but also one of the most dangerous routes. It would mean 16 days of straight walking even for an adult with no rest stops; many of the migrants come with their children.",
      "Since migrants usually cannot find work to support themselves in Tapachula, most of the foreigners trapped there are desperate to leave. Some feel a sense of urgency, hoping to reach the border before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be more difficult, that's why we are going in hopes of getting an appointment quicker so we are able to cross before he (Trump) takes office,\u201d said Yotzeli Pe\u00f1a, 23, a migrant from Venezuela. \u201cThat would be easier.\u201d",
      "This year, in a bid to stop people from gathering at the border to claim asylum, the U.S. government expanded areas where migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to a large swath of southern Mexico.",
      "The CBP One cellphone app was instituted to make asylum claims more orderly. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. But the service was only available in northern and central Mexico.",
      "By extending the app south to Tapachula, officials hoped it would stem the rush north. But some migrants still want to be close to the border so that if they do get one of the cherished appointments, they can get to it quickly and not risk missing it. Trump has promised to end the app, reduce legal pathways to the U.S. and organize mass deportations.",
      "The biggest caravans formed in 2018 and 2019, and back then Mexican officials helped out some of the migrants by arranging buses to border cities, but that created a backlash in those communities. Groups from those original caravans did eventually reach the border.",
      "In caravans since then, most participants have sought out as many hitch-hiking or paid rides as they can, and often swarm empty trucks to hitch a ride on empty freight platforms. But that has become much harder as Mexican authorities discouraged buses, taxis and trucks from stopping to pick up migrants. In recent years, authorities have eventually offered temporary transit permits to dissolve the caravans."

      "Politically significant Maharashtra is India\u2019s wealthiest state and home to the financial and entertainment capital, Mumbai. It is currently ruled by a coalition of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party and a Hindu nationalist ally. An opposition alliance, including the Congress party, is in power in eastern Jharkhand state.",
      "Modi has held big rallies in the two states. The challenge comes barely four months after his party suffered a setback and returned to power in national elections for a third term without a parliamentary majority. He formed the government with the help of regional partners.",
      "Modi, in a post on social platform X ahead of the state elections, wrote: \"On this occasion, I appeal to all the youth and women voters to vote in large numbers.\u201d",
      "Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst who wrote a Modi biography, said a reversal in these state elections would negatively impact Modi\u2019s leadership style.",
      "\u201cIt will have repercussions for the BJP in coming elections in Delhi and Bihar states next year,\" he said.",
      "Votes in the two states will be counted on Saturday.",
      "After suffering a setback in national elections, the BJP regained momentum in October as it won Haryana state elections, where pollsters had predicted an easy victory for the opposition Congress party.",
      "Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Congress party won a consolation victory in alliance with the regional National Conference party in local elections in India\u2019s insurgency-wracked Jammu and Kashmir after a 10-year gap.",
      "The BJP is trying to wrest power from the Congress party and its allies in Jharkhand, a state rich in iron ore, coal and other minerals.",
      "The BJP\u2019s use of slogans like \u201cIf you divide, then you will die\u201d and \u201cIf we are united, then we are safe\u201d to attract Hindu votes has prompted opposition parties to accuse the BJP of trying to polarize the voters along Hindu-Muslim religious lines.",
      "Hindus constitute nearly 80% and Muslims 11.5% of Maharashtra state\u2019s estimated 131 million people.",
      "Mukhopadhyay saw a tendency from top BJP leaders to communalize the elections, saying, \"It shows the growing desperation of the party, and it looks like their reading is they are not doing very well in Maharashtra and Jharkhand states.\"",
      "Election surveys on the eve of polling put the opposition alliance comprising the Congress party and two truncated regional groups, the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress party, ahead of the BJP and its allies currently governing the state. The Congress party defeated the BJP and its allies in the June national elections by winning 30 out of 48 seats in the state. The BJP and its regional partners won 17 seats.",
      "The Congress party and its allies hope to capitalize on the simmering disaffection with high youth unemployment, inflation and low crop prices during the BJP\u2019s rule.",
      "The BJP hopes to attract women voters with a scheme that provides 1,500 rupees ($18) a month to over 20 million women aged 21-65 whose annual family income is less than 250,000 ($3,010). If the Congress party is voted to power in the state, it has promised women double that amount and free transportation in government buses."

      "The police did not identify the suspects, only saying that a dual Finnish-Nigerian citizen, born in the 1980s, was under criminal investigation.",
      "However, Simon Ekpa, a Nigerian linked to the Biafran separatist movement, lives in Lahti, where the P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me District Court will consider a request from the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation to keep the suspects in custody.",

      "The secessionist campaign in southeastern Nigeria dates back to the 1960s when the short-lived Republic of Biafra fought and lost a civil war from 1967 to 1970 to become independent from the West African country. An estimated 1 million people died in the conflict, many from starvation.",
      "Nigerian authorities have accused Ekpa of using social media to instigate violence by his followers in Nigeria, many of them young people.",
      "Police in Finland said the investigation involves international cooperation.",
      "Nigerian authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "For many years Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with at least 210 million people, has been wracked by violence related to the activities of armed extremist groups. Most recently, social protests were held over a worsening cost-of-living crisis and alleged bad governance."

      "The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and is likely to further isolate them and complicate efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to end the 13-month conflict.",

      "BAGHDAD -- Iraq began its first nationwide population census in decades Wednesday, a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions.",
      "The act of counting the population is also contentious. The census is expected to have profound implications for Iraq\u2019s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning.",
      "Minority groups fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.",
      "The count in territories such as Kirkuk, Diyala and Mosul -- where control is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government in the north -- has drawn intense scrutiny.",
      "Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning, said agreements on how to conduct the count in the disputed areas were reached in meetings involving Iraq\u2019s prime minister, president and senior officials from the Kurdish region.",
      "\u201cResearchers from all major ethnic groups \u2014 Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians \u2014 will conduct the census in these areas to ensure fairness,\u201d he said.",
      "The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region.",
      "The new census \u201ccharts a developmental map for the future and sends a message of stability,\u201d Planning Minister Mohammed Tamim said in a televised address.",
      "The census will be the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq\u2019s demographic, social, and economic landscape, offiials say. Some 120,000 census workers will survey households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days.",
      "The Interior Ministry announced a nationwide curfew during the census period, restricting movement of citizens, vehicles and trains between cities, districts and rural areas, with exceptions for humanitarian cases.",
      "Shops were closed in Baghdad on Wednesday and streets were empty except for checkpoints set up to enforce the curfew. In some neighborhoods, people sat in chairs on the sidewalks drinking tea and talking to the census workers.",
      "Among them was Aqeel Al-Rubaie, a father of three who provided his information to the workers.",
      "\u201cThe census is important, but I do not trust politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may exploit the census for political conflict.\u201d",
      "Census worker Ali Amer, wearing a brown jacket with the logo of the Ministry of Planning, said people asked him, \u201cWill the census cause us harm? And what kind of harm?\u201d He said he tried to reassure them.",
      "The count will be carried out using the \u201cde jure\u201d method, in which people are counted in their usual area of residence, Saleh said.",
      "That means that people internally displaced by years of war will be counted in the areas where they have since settled, not in their original communities. The census will not include Iraqis residing abroad or those forcibly displaced to other countries.",
      "Saleh estimated Iraq\u2019s population at 44.5 million and said the Kurdish region\u2019s share of the national budget \u2014 currently 12% \u2014 is based on an estimated population of 6 million. The census will also clarify the number of public employees in the region.",
      "By order of Iraq\u2019s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian.",
      "\u201cThis approach is intended to prevent tensions and ensure the census serves developmental rather than divisive goals,\u201d Saleh said. The census will be monitored by international observers who will travel across Iraq\u2019s provinces to assess the data quality, he said.",
      "Hogr Chato, director of the Irbil-based Public Aid Organization, said the census will reshape the map of political thinking and future decision making.",
      "\u201cEven though some leaders deny it, the data will inevitably have political and economic implications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also fair to allocate budgets based on population numbers, as areas with larger populations or those impacted by war need more resources.\u201d",

      "Anti-government protesters sought to block a courthouse in Novi Sad, where the roof collapse at the station on Nov. 1 killed 15 people and injured two others. Riot police pushed the protesters away from the building.",
      "A similar opposition action on Tuesday resulted in an hourslong standoff.",
      "The collapse in Novi Sad has triggered a wave of protests against the populist authorities and arrests of several activists who have taken part. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption led to sloppy renovation work at the station and consequently to the roof collapse.",

      "Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies, simplifying the rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes.",
      "The Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Wednesday published details of the updated liturgical book, which Francis approved April 29 and which replaces the previous edition that was last published in 2000.",
      "Francis turns 88 in December and, despite some health and mobility problems, appears in fine form. On Wednesday, he presided over a spirited general audience that featured children who spontaneously rushed the stage.",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that will elect their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites became seemingly necessary after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022.",
      "The Vatican had to work out a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years, and a few months later Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Monsignor Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the papal funeral rites to simplify them.",
      "In that 2023 interview with Mexican Televisa broadcaster N+, Francis also revealed that he had decided he would be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter\u2019s Basilica where most popes are buried.",
      "Ravelli said the new reform simplifies the funeral rites, including eliminating the requirement that the pope be placed on an elevated bier in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing. Rather, he will be on view in a simple coffin, and the burial no longer requires the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The simplification, Ravelli was quoted as saying, is meant \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "Since his 2013 election, Francis has eschewed the pomp often associated with the papacy to emphasize his role as the bishop of Rome and a servant of the \u201cchurch of the poor.\u201d The Argentine Jesuit lives in the Vatican hotel, not the Apostolic Palace, and travels in small Fords or Fiats, not fancy SUVs.",
      "His desire to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every trip, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",

      "The policy will take effect next May and aims to expand the country's aging workforce. Spain has remained largely open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers.",
      "Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at \u201ccultural wealth and respect for human rights, it\u2019s also prosperity.\u201d",

      "After allowing Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles to launch strikes deeper into Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington\u2019s policy on antipersonnel land mines for Ukraine was needed to counter changing Russian tactics.",
      "The war, which reached its 1,000-day milestone on Tuesday, has largely been going Russia\u2019s way. Moscow's bigger army is slowly pushing Ukraine\u2019s forces backward in the eastern Donetsk region, while Ukrainian civilians are being maimed and killed by Russian drones and missiles often fired from inside Russia.",
      "Individual ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading the Russian battlefield advance, so Ukraine has \u201ca need for things that can help slow down that effort,\u201d Austin said during a trip to Laos.",
      "The announcement comes two months before Donald Trump replaces Joe Biden in the White House. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war and has criticized the amount the U.S. has spent on supporting Ukraine.",
      "Biden administration officials say they are determined to help Ukraine as much as possible before he leaves office, and they announced Wednesday that the U.S. intends to cancel half of the debt \u2014 some $4.6 billion \u2014 Ukraine owes to the country. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said U.S. lawmakers were informed of the move this week, and that he doesn't expect them to pass a resolution of disapproval to try to stop the loan forgiveness because of the bipartisan support for Ukraine in the current Congress.",
      "The steps taken to help Ukraine \u2014 along with unconfirmed reports Wednesday of Ukraine firing a certain British cruise missile at Russia for the first time \u2014 were likely to vex Moscow.",
      "The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv temporarily closed on Wednesday in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital.",
      "Humanitarian groups have long criticized the use of antipersonnel mines because they present a lingering threat to civilians. Amnesty International called the U.S. decision \u201creckless\u201d and a \u201cdeeply disappointing setback.\" And Norway\u2019s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, called it \u201cvery problematic\u201d because Ukraine is a signatory to an international convention opposing the use of land mines.",
      "Austin pointed out that Ukraine already makes its own antipersonnel mines, and that the U.S. has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines. He also tried to allay concerns about the new mines the U.S. is giving Kyiv, saying they are not persistent, meaning troops can control when they would self-detonate.",
      "\u201cThat makes it far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own,\u201d Austin said.",
      "The mines are are electrically fused and powered by batteries so that when the battery runs out, they won\u2019t detonate. They can become inert in anywhere from four hours to two weeks.",
      "Russia already uses land mines in Ukraine, but those don\u2019t become inert over time.",
      "The United States also sought commitments from the Ukrainians on the use of the mines to limit harm to innocent civilians, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine would use the mines in its own country and would not put them in civilian populated areas.",
      "The mines are contained in a $275 million package of new military assistance announced by the Biden administration Wednesday. Also included in the package are High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, as well as 155 mm and 105 mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor munitions, and other equipment and spare parts.",
      "The war has taken on a growing international dimension with the arrival of North Korean troops to help Russia on the battlefield \u2014 a development that U.S. officials said prompted Biden\u2019s policy shift on allowing Ukraine to fire longer-range U.S. missiles into Russia and that angered the Kremlin.",
      "Britain had been quietly pressing the U.S. to ease restrictions on how Western-supplied missiles are used, and unconfirmed news reports Wednesday said Ukraine had fired British-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles at Russia for the first time. British and Ukrainian officials didn't confirm the reports.",
      "Officials with France's military and president\u2019s office, meanwhile, declined to say whether Ukraine is using French long-range SCALP missiles to strike targets in Russia, citing France's military secrecy policy. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for such a step for months.",
      "After the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to attack Russia with longer-range American-made ATACMS missiles, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal, with the new doctrine announced Tuesday permitting a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.",
      "That could potentially include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.",
      "The American diplomatic mission in Kyiv said Wednesday that it had received a warning about a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital and closed the embassy for several hours before reopening. The Spanish, Italian and Greek embassies also closed, but the U.K. government and France said that their embassies remained open.",
      "Western leaders dismissed the Russian reaction to the U.S. missile decision as an attempt to deter Ukraine\u2019s allies from providing further support to Kyiv, but the escalating tension weighed on stock markets after Ukraine fired ATACMS missiles for the first time at a target inside Russia.",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia been stockpiling powerful long-range missiles, possibly in an upcoming effort to crush the Ukrainian power grid as winter approaches.",
      "Military analysts say the U.S. decision on the range over which American-made missiles can be used isn't expected to be a game-changer, but it could help weaken the Russian war effort, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "\u201cUkrainian long-range strikes against military objects within Russia\u2019s rear are crucial for degrading Russian military capabilities throughout the theater,\" it said.",

      "In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines.",
      "EV sales however have lagged as consumers weary of inflation have held back on spending and after major car market Germany dropped government purchase incentives for EVs. Electric vehicles sales fell by 5.8% in the first nine months of the year in an overall shrinking market for cars. Carmakers are also facing increasing competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles.",
      "The company said that it would also reduce working time for workers at its Cologne, Germany, plant where it makes the Capri and Explorer electric vehicles.",
      "Ford sales fell 15.3% in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The company's market share shrank to 3% from 3.5% The Dearborn, Michigan, headquartered automaker saw companywide net profit fall by 26% to $892 million in the third quarter as it took $1 billion in accounting charges to write down assets for a canceled three-row electric SUV. The company cited higher warranty and other costs.",
      "Ford is an established brand in Europe and will mark its 100th anniversary of doing business in Germany next year. Its main plant in Cologne started production in 1931; the groundbreaking was attended by Henry Ford and then-Mayor Konrad Adenauer, later Germany\u2019s chancellor.",
      "Ford is not alone in suffering from headwinds. Volkswagen has said it is contemplating closing as many as three of its German plants, according to its chief employee representative. European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association has called for a speedier review of lower C02 limits slated for 2026.",
      "Ford said company vice chairman and CFO John Lawler had written a letter to the German government reiterating Ford's commitment to climate goals but urging action to improve market conditions and ensuring the industry\u2019s future success.",
      "\"What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives to help consumers make the shift to electrified vehicles, improving cost competitiveness for manufacturers, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets,\u201d Lawler said."

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "But he soon realized that he was recruited by Kremlin-backed Wagner forces to spread Russian propaganda in the country, the crown jewel in Moscow's operations on the African continent.",
      "Despite threats and intimidation, Yalike-Ngonzo fled and made it to Europe several months ago with the help of The Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa. On Thursday, he became the first person to tell the story of the Russian disinformation machine in Central African Republic from the inside.",
      "\u201cIt is important for me to share this story so that justice can be done,\u201d he told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cTo denounce the disrespect of human rights, and to expose the disinformation system which can be replicated in other countries.\u201d",
      "Yalike-Ngonzo said that for three years he was tasked with writing stories praising the activities of the Russian forces and the army and military government of the Central African Republic and placing them in local media outlets. He was also asked to organize anti-Western demonstrations and suppress voices critical of the government.",
      "He started asking himself questions when he was told to write an article containing false information about the situation in the country in a bid to silence dissent.",

It is one of the first countries in which Kremlin-backed Wagner mercenaries established their operations on the pledge of fighting back rebel groups and bringing back peace.",
      "But instead of stabilizing the country, Wagner forces have been accused of gross human rights violations and defending the brutal military regime of Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, in power since March 2016. Moscow has also put in place a multi-faceted disinformation strategy in Africa, Western diplomats said, with the aim of promoting a positive image of Kremlin, while spreading anti-Western sentiment and destabilizing democratic institutions.",

The AP was unable to verify the information provided by Yalike-Ngonzo in the interview.",

Two years ago in Mali, the group and the country's army were accused of executing about 300 men \u2014 some suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians \u2014 in what Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the country\u2019s decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic, mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to cut hands, remove nails, throw fuel and burn people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis is warning that the Vatican's troubled pension fund faces a &ldquo;serious imbalance&rdquo; and cannot guarantee future obligations without &ldquo;urgent structural&rdquo; reforms",
    "story": [
      "Pope Francis is warning that the Vatican's troubled pension fund faces a \u201cserious imbalance\u201d and cannot guarantee future obligations without \u201curgent structural\u201d reforms",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis, who has imposed a series of cost-cutting measures across the cash-strapped Vatican, warned Thursday that the city state\u2019s troubled pension fund needs urgent reform to guarantee future obligations.",
      "Vatican employees responded by expressing concern that their compensation might be targeted in any further cost-cutting to shore up the pension system, and asked for the fund's finances to be made public.",
      "In a letter to Vatican department heads and cardinals, Francis said he had named a top economic adviser Cardinal Kevin Farrell as a special administrator for the fund, suggesting that decisive, immediate action was necessary.",
      "The letter was the latest evidence of the Vatican\u2019s precarious financial situation, after years of mismanagement, financial scandals and budget deficits -- all worsened by COVID-19 and the months-long closures of a key source of revenue, the Vatican Museums.",
      "Already, Francis has cut the salaries of cardinals by 10%, suspended some seniority bonuses, trimmed special stipends for Rome-based cardinals and begun charging some market-rate rents for their apartments.",
      "The pension fund has long been the source of particular concern, and in the new letter Francis acknowledged that the current analysis \u201cindicates a serious prospective imbalance in the fund, the size of which tends to expand over time in the absence of intervention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn concrete terms, this means that the current system is unable to guarantee in the medium term the fulfillment of the pension obligation for future generations,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, voiced alarm at Francis\u2019 warning about their pensions, insisting that lay employees had already sacrificed enough in his cost-cutting initiatives and that the Vatican leadership should listen to workers\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cSalaries have not been indexed to the cost of living, while rent increases for Vatican properties have been related to inflation,\u201d the group said in a statement that also called for the Vatican to make public the pension fund\u2019s balance sheet.",
      "Noting that Francis frequently preaches about the need to give workers dignified wages and pay special attention to the needs of families, the union said employees were \u201cexhausted by cuts and especially by the lack of responses to their legitimate request to be heard.\u201d",
      "The Vatican has some 4,500 employees, around 3,100 of whom work for the Holy See bureaucracy and the rest for the Vatican city state itself, in the museums and other offices that run the territory. The union counts some 700 lay employees.",
      "While Vatican salaries are typically low, the benefits can be attractive to Italian laypeople, including tax-free income and access to a private health system, below-market rents and a tax-free supermarket, gas station, pharmacy and department store.",
      "Lay employees, however, have increasingly been raising their voices about cost cuts and overwork. Earlier this year 49 museum employees filed a class-action lawsuit in the Vatican tribunal about labor woes.",
      "The Holy See ended 2023 with a profit of 45.9 million euros, according to the latest financial statement.",
      "As recently as 2015, the pension fund had insisted it was in sound financial health, and that it was expected to top 500 million euros by the end of 2015 after having started out with the equivalent of 5 million euros in 1993.",
      "Farrell, an Irish-born American who heads the Vatican\u2019s laity and family office, has increasingly been entrusted with the Vatican\u2019s most sensitive financial and administrative issues under Francis. He is the camerlengo, who runs the Holy See after the death of a pope, and heads the investment committee, the commission that deals with the most sensitive \u201creserved\u201d matters facing the church and is the president of the Vatican city state\u2019s supreme court.",

      "\u201cNigeriens, wake up, we don\u2019t want the French army on our land anymore,\u201d sang Sarki, referring to the French troops asked to leave in the wake of the military takeover in Niger and other countries in the region.",

      "\u201cArgentina is not a great power and it is in a very difficult situation economically,\" said Roberto Goulart Menezes, a professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia. That pressure, he added, was \u201cenough for Argentina to finally reduce its opposition.\u201d",
      "During Milei's first-ever meeting with Xi on Tuesday, the leaders discussed their \u201ccurrent trade and financial ties\" and \u201cdesire to continue exploring new opportunities to expand and improve,\u201d the Argentine presidency said in a statement, along with a photo of the presidents sharing a warm handshake. It said the leaders had invited each other to visit.",
      "With Argentina highly reliant on China as a market for its soybeans and other crops, the cordial tone made clear that the crisis-stricken South American nation has no desire for relations with its second-largest trading partner and crucial source of financing to further deteriorate.",
      "A statement from China's foreign ministry said Xi expressed his appreciation for Milei's \u201cwillingness to continue deepening bilateral cooperation.\"",
      "China has maintained strategic assets in Argentina, including stakes in lithium mines and a space station in Patagonia. Earlier this year, former Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, whom Milei recently fired, led a successful visit to China to patch up relations strained by Milei's colorful insults (\"Would you trade with an assassin?\" he asked on the campaign trail last August, accusing China of killing dissidents).",
      "After Mondino's trip, Beijing in June resumed a currency swap deal worth billions of dollars that boosted Argentina\u2019s depleted reserves.",
      "On Monday, as negotiations over the G20 draft grew increasingly tense, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira signed a memorandum of understanding that offered a new and important source of income to cash-strapped Argentina.",
      "The agreement to work toward shipping 30 million cubic meters of natural gas to Brazil from Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta, a vast shale oil and gas field in Patagonia, over the next five years, \u201cmight have helped\u201d Milei sign the joint G20 statement, Silveira told reporters.",
      "But it did nothing to dispel the chill between the leaders of South America's largest economies, who have opposite views on climate change, social issues and the role of governments.",
      "A set of official photographs that splashed across the front pages of local newspapers Tuesday showed Lula and other government leaders clasping hands amicably in sharp contrast to the Brazilian leader's photo-op with Milei \u2014 both men standing stiffly apart despite protocol demanding they shake hands, looking like they\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world.",
      "Some fear that Trump's election has further emboldened Milei and other far-right political figures to abandon U.N. commitments and ambitious multilateral agreements on issues like climate change.",
      "\u201cMilei has already taken a pro-Trump stance, thinking ... that the G20 could be emptied by President Trump,\" said Goulart Menezes, the international relations expert.",
      "Yet, he cautioned that \u201cmaking Argentina\u2019s foreign policy conditional on the future president of the United States\u201d carries risks.",
      "\u201cArgentina is putting itself in a position of international isolation,\" he said.",
      "Indeed, at the traditional G20 family photo \u2014 taken for a second time Tuesday because U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau failed to show up to the first \u2014 Milei was the only leader missing from the lineup.",
      "There would be no third attempt.",

      "South Korea's spy agency says that North Korea has recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine, while some of the thousands of North Korean troops deployed in Russia have begun engaging in combat, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "The South Korean assessment came after Russia warned Monday that U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles adds \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d of the war. U.S. officials said Biden\u2019s decision was triggered almost entirely by North Korea\u2019s entry into the war.",
      "In a closed-door briefing at parliament, the National Intelligence Service said that North Korea exported 170mm self-propelled guns and 240mm multiple rocket launch systems to Russia, according to lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.",
      "Lee told reporters that the NIS assessed those weapons are a type of artillery the Russian military doesn\u2019t operate so North Korea likely dispatched personnel to teach the Russians how to use them and handle their maintenance.",
      "Last week, Russian Telegram channels and other social media posts published photos apparently showing North Korean\u2019s \u201cKoksan\u201d 170mm self-propelled guns being moved by rail inside Russia. The Financial Times, citing Ukrainian intelligence assessments, reported Sunday that North Korea in recent weeks sent some 50 domestically produced 170mm self-propelled howitzers and 20 240mm multiple launch rocket systems to Russia.",
      "The artillery systems are the latest conventional weapons that North Korea is believed to have provided to Russia as the two countries are sharply expanding their military cooperation in the face of separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. Last month, the NIS said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",
      "During its Wednesday briefing, the NIS said that an estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late October were moved to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized parts of its territory this year, following their training in Russia's northeast, Lee said. He cited the NIS as saying the North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the frontlines.",
      "The U.S., Ukraine and others have similar estimates on the size of North Korea's troop deployment. They say the North Korean soldiers arrived in Russia in October and that some of them have since engaged in combat in the Kursk region. Observers say North Korea's participation in the almost 3-year war threatens to escalate the conflict.",
      "Park Sunwon, another lawmaker who was present at the NIS meeting, made similar comments on the briefing. He said the spy agency couldn\u2019t provide an assessment on possible North Korean casualties.",
      "Moscow said Tuesday that Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, in what would be Kyiv\u2019s first use of the weapon inside Russia. Ukraine\u2019s General Staff did not confirm whether the weapon was used, but said the armed forces struck an ammunition warehouse in the Bryansk region, which neighbors Kursk and was likely supplying Russian forces fighting there.",
      "Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia.",

      "Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai is testifying in his defense at his landmark national security trial",
      "HONG KONG -- Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai denied in his landmark national security trial on Wednesday he had asked then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against the city and China during the territory's anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "He testified about his meetings with former U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including Taiwan ex-President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten.",
      "The media tycoon, who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist, said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them.",
      "Lai\u2019s case is widely seen as a measure of media freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "Lai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong during a 2019 visit to the U.S. But he said he did not ask the U.S. government to take any action, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me.\u201d",
      "During the same trip Lai also met with Pompeo and had a similar discussion about the situation in Hong Kong, he said.",
      "When Lai\u2019s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something at that meeting, Lai said \u201cnot to do something but to say something. To voice out its support for Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "Beijing promised to retain the former British colony\u2019s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security.",
      "Authorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong\u2019s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \u201cunder the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "They pointed to Lai\u2019s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement.",
      "Dozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,\u201d said Wong, 64.",
      "Upon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city\u2019s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen.",
      "During the hearing, Lai said that he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Tsai, whom he called a friend.",
      "Lai said Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then President Donald Trump's administration, and knew he was \u201csupportive of Trump.\" She thought he was familiar with the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said.",
      "He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S., because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people.",
      "But Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a \u201ccrazy\u201d idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it.",
      "He said he broke into the media world \u201cto participate in delivering freedom.\"",
      "\u201cThe more you know, the more you are free,\u201d he said, adding that the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy",
      "In May 2020, a month before the security law took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily.",
      "The trial will continue on Thursday.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. governments and independent U.N. human rights experts have called for Lai\u2019s release.",
      "Asked before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai\u2019s release, Trump said: \u201c100%, I will get him out.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said that mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai\u2019s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s security minister Chris Tang maintained the prosecution was based on facts.",
      "Lai\u2019s son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father\u2019s treatment in prison is \u201cinhumane.\u201d \u201cMy father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,\u201d he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers.",
      "On Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates \u201chas been made at his own request\u201d and was approved by prison authorities. It added judges remain independent and partial when handling national security cases.",
      "Chinese foreign ministry's spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Wednesday that Lai is a major mastermind in the rise of anti-China sentiments in Hong Kong and a \u201cpawn of anti-China forces.\u201d He said China firmly opposes the interference of certain countries in its internal affairs.",
      "On the eve of the court hearing, some U.S. lawmakers gathered with the younger Lai in a restaurant near the U.S. Capitol in Washington in a show of support for the publisher.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in the U.K. has risen sharply to a six-month high in October, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing rates this year",
      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose sharply to a six-month high in October and back above the rate targeted by rate-setters at the Bank of England, official figures showed Wednesday, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing costs this year.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said higher domestic energy bills pushed up consumer price inflation up to 2.3% in the year to October from the three-year low of 1.7% recorded the previous month. Stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy, didn't help either.",
      "The increase, which was above forecasts for a more modest increase, took inflation above the bank's target rate of 2%.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank decreased its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 after inflation fell to its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "However, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey cautioned that rates wouldn't be falling too fast over the coming months, partly because last month's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done. Rate-setters will meet once more this year, on Dec. 19, by which time they will be armed with more monthly inflation readings.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-9.",
      "Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England.",
      "In her budget, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could push inflation higher than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The global inflation outlook has also become more uncertain since Donald Trump was reelected U.S. president. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, and thereby keeping interest rates higher than they otherwise would have been.",
      "\u201cWhile we think the Bank of England will continue to cut rates in 2025, the pace of rate cuts is expected to be slower than previously anticipated, and rates may stay elevated for longer,\u201d said Monica George Michail, an economist at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a think tank that now reckons inflation will push above 3% in early 2025.",
      "\u201cThis outlook reflects forecasted inflationary pressures stemming from the recently announced budget, in addition to heightened global uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump presidency,\u201d she added."

      "Residents of the Hawaii town devastated by last year's wildfire are awaiting the return of one of the nation's most prestigious basketball tournaments with mixed feelings",
      "HONOLULU -- Three generations of TJ Rickard\u2019s family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament.",
      "Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina\u2019s humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he says, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes.",
      "\u201cNot even a minute drive away from where they play, there\u2019s houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,\u201d said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School.",
      "Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there\u2019s also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day.",
      "\u201cPeople are in a weird state right now over here because there\u2019s so much displacement and loss of community,\u201d said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.\u201d",
      "Boosters coming to Lahaina should know \u201cit\u2019s been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,\" Conrad said.",
      "The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA\u2019s best men\u2019s teams \u2014 including two-time defending champion UConn \u2014 to Lahaina\u2019s 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days.",
      "Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,\u201d Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family.",
      "Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished.",
      "Rickard\u2019s experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents\u2019 house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too.",
      "Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family.",
      "Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said.",
      "University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said.",
      "Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames \u2014 Mala Ocean Tavern \u2014 eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope.",
      "\u201cLike, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it\u2019s back,\" Barberi said. \"That restaurant was gone. Now it\u2019s back. That house was gone, now it\u2019s being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.\u201d",
      "Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said.",
      "Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal.",
      "Being around the teams helped her \u201cdream big,\u201d her father said.",
      "Tickets to the games this year range from $56 to $236 depending on the game and seat location, but local residents get about a 28% discount. Tournament organizers and teams will hold basketball clinics for local students.",
      "Organizers have reminded participating schools and their teams to be respectful, and the tournament website has the same message for fans. The athletes and their coaches say they understand.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s where you try to remind guys that we\u2019re very fortunate to be able to travel and do the things the way we do, and we\u2019re going to a community that had a huge devastation that none of us would want anyone go to through,\u201d said North Carolina assistant coach Sean May. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to have some compassion.\"",
      "\"But I think at the end, they\u2019re happy we\u2019re there, we\u2019re happy to be there, it\u2019s great for the community. And to me, it brings so much excitement.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:42:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Target has reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items",
    "story": [
      "Target has reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items",
      "NEW YORK -- Target on Wednesday reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "The Minneapolis retailer fell short of Wall Street expectations for the quarter, and its profit and sales outlook for the final three months of the year also disappointed industry analysts. Costs related to a U.S. dockworkers\u2019 strike in October also dragged on Target's results at a time when Americans are spending more selectively, the company said.",
      "\u201cWe encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance,\u201d Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said.",
      "The weak August through October period at Target stood in stark contrast to the third quarter of low-price rival Walmart, which reported another quarter of stellar sales Tuesday and released optimistic projections for the holiday season.",
      "Target's outlook was particularly concerning because the discount merchandiser reduced prices on more than 2,000 products for the holidays and rolled out a Thanksgiving dinner deal that put the cost of the holiday meal below last year's total.",
      "Target\u2019s shares plummeted Wednesday, ending down more than 21%. Walmart's share rose nearly 3% after posting its results Tuesday.",
      "The disappointing quarter at Target may have reflected the financial circumstances and mood of U.S. consumers in the months before Election Day. Even as the overall inflation rate came down, voters told pollsters they were unhappy with the state of the economy when the costs of housing, food and other essentials remained so high compared to before the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Customers are \u201cbeing very patient, shopping for promos, looking for great value on those essential items that they need for their pantry,\u201d Cornell told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they\u2019re shopping very conservatively and have been in discretionary categories throughout the year.\u201d",
      "That consumer sentiment wasn't aligned in Target\u2019s favor. Groceries account for about 60% of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business, according to the Arkansas-based company\u2019s most recent annual report. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories because less than a quarter of its sales come from food and beverages.",
      "\u201cAll these things undermine the Target model, which partly relies on a robust consumer who is comfortable loading their cart with things that they want but do not absolutely need,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData, said.",
      "Walmart\u2019s size also makes it difficult for its competitor to prevail on price. Walmart operates nearly 5,000 stores in the U.S. and generated annual sales of $611.3 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2024. In contrast, Target operates 1,900 stores and generated sales of $107.4 billion in the latest fiscal year.",
      "And even if Target has prices that are lower than or equal to Walmart's on some items, it has always battled a perception of being more expensive, Saunders said.",
      "Their marketing slogans reinforce that perception: Target's is \u201cExpect More. Pay Less.\u201d Walmart's is \u201cEvery Day Low Prices.\u201d",
      "Target recorded its lackluster quarterly sales even as it has moved aggressively to cut prices. For the summer, it lowered prices on thousands of necessities ranging from diapers to milk. By the end of December, the company said it will have reduced the prices of over 10,000 items during the year.",
      "Analysts also say that Target has faced stiffer competition from Walmart when it comes to discretionary items like home goods and apparel. Over the past few years, Walmart has added mannequins in its fashion departments and spruced up its fashion selection with more stylish items.",
      "While Target has refreshed its food offerings, Walmart recently launched Bettergoods, its biggest store-label food brand in 20 years in terms of the breadth of items, seeking to appeal to younger customers who are not loyal to grocery brands and want chef-inspired foods that are more affordably priced. The colorfully packaged products include pistachio nut butter and smokey vanilla ground coffee.",
      "Walmart said it's been gaining market share, especially among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online shopping services, which included curbside order pickups, and its paid membership shipping program, Walmart +, also have helped attract wealthier customers.",
      "In response, Target has tried to step up its game. In April, it unveiled a paid membership program called Target Circle 360, which comes with unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 and free two-day shipping for all orders.",
      "Saunders noted that Target has also struggled with operational issues.",
      "Target, like other retailers, had to reroute some merchandise when 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for the first time since 1977. For Walmart, the walkout seemed to cause a hiccup. But the strike took a toll on Target's profits as it struggled with inventory buildup in its warehouses.",
      "Target posted net income of $854 million, or $1.85 per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, far short of the $2.30 analysts were looking for, according to FactSet, and down from $971 million, or $2.10 per share, in the year-ago period.",
      "Sales rose to $25.67 billion, up from $25.4 billion last year, but fell shy of Wall Street expectations.",
      "Target said that it now expects its earnings per share to be in the range of $1.85 to $2.45 for its fiscal fourth quarter. That\u2019s below the $2.65 per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "The retailer reported that its comparable sales \u2014 those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months \u2014 rose 0.3% during the third quarter. That\u2019s below the 2% gain posted in the second quarter. The increase in the April-June period reversed months of declines, including a 3.7% drop in the first quarter and a 4.4% decline during the company\u2019s final quarter of 2023.",
      "There were some bright spots. Target said quarterly customer traffic increased 2.4%. Target executives said that translates to 10 million more sales transactions from a year ago. Digital comparable sales also increased 10.8%, reflecting a 20% increase in same-day delivery.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from other countries will create challenges for Target and other retailers. Retailers have warned they would be forced to pass the costs of higher tariffs on to shoppers.",
      "\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to what will happen, and we\u2019ll use our agility to adjust accordingly, \u201d Cornell told reporters Tuesday."

      "WASHINGTON -- Russia's third largest bank, Gazprombank and its six foreign subsidiaries were hit with U.S. sanctions on Thursday \u2014 in a move intended to curtail Russia's ability to evade the thousands of sanctions imposed on the nation since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and \u201cwill make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.\u201d",
      "In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions.",
      "The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war.",
      "In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. \u201cremains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u201d",
      "Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them.",
      "Canada and the United Kingdom have previously sanctioned Gazprombank.",
      "Treasury states that Gazprombank is a means for Russia to fund its military to continue its war effort against Ukraine, using the bank to pay soldiers and compensate families of Russian soldiers killed in the fighting.",
      "Gazprombank played a role in remaining Russian natural gas supplies to Europe by handling payments from foreign customers.",
      "Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis.",
      "European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe\u2019s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria\u2019s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere. The EU has set a nonbinding goal of ending all Russian gas imports by 2027.",

    "story": [
      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "Federal water officials have made public what they call \u201cnecessary steps\u201d for the seven states and multiple tribes that rely on the Colorado River to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Federal water officials made public on Wednesday what they called \u201cnecessary steps\u201d for seven states and multiple tribes that use Colorado River water and hydropower to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future.",
      "\u201cToday we show our collective work,\u201d Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said as she outlined four proposals for action and one \u201cno action\u201d alternative that she and Biden's government will leave for the incoming Trump Administration \u2014 with formal environmental assessments still to come and just 20 months to act.",
      "The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles.",
      "Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take the any of the proposals,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cThe federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.\u201d",
      "One alternative would have the government act to \u201cprotect critical infrastructure\u201d including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. \u201cBut there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,\u201d the announcement said.",
      "A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with \u201cfederal and non-federal storage\u201d to boost system sustainability and flexibility \u201cthrough a new approach to distributing\u201d water during shortages.",
      "The third, dubbed \u201ccooperative conservation,\u201d cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid \u201cshared contributions to sustain system integrity.\"",
      "And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and \u201cafford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno action\u201d option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said.",
      "In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do.",
      "\u201cWe still have a pretty wide gap between us,\u201d Tom Buschatzke, Arizona\u2019s main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights.",
      "Buschatzke said he saw \u201csome really positive elements\u201d in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. \u201cI think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives \u201cunderscore how serious a situation we\u2019re facing on the Colorado River.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,\u201d he said. \"Otherwise, we\u2019ll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas.",
      "Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said \u201csnapshots\u201d offered in the announcement \u201cunderscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement \u201cshows an expectation of continuity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,\u201d she said.",

      "The Adani group had also been awarded a deal to construct power transmission lines in Kenya, East Africa's business hub.",
      "Also Thursday, Energy Minister Opiyo Wandayi told a parliamentary committee there was no bribery or corruption involved on Kenya's part in signing that deal.",
      "U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani this week on charges he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. He was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud."

Only the Grand Touring trim level slides in under our $40,000 price cap, but it\u2019s well equipped with leather upholstery, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors. Though the Miata\u2019s low-to-the-ground design limits winter drivability during heavier storms, the car\u2019s playful handling can be a delight to experience following a light snowfall.",

      "Subaru has earned a reputation for building vehicles that are well suited for winter. And among the brand\u2019s current lineup, the most fun to drive for the winter is the WRX. This rally-bred sport sedan pairs a 271-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual transmission and standard all-wheel drive to provide impressive traction and acceleration on any road surface.",
      "Most WRX versions are priced under our $40,000 limit. We\u2019d go with the Premium trim for overall value. It comes with cloth upholstery, heated front seats, heated side mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icer, and all-weather floor mats are an option. You can also get it with an automatic transmission.",

      "The chief executive of Delta Air Lines says the incoming Trump administration will be a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d for airlines after what he calls government \u201coverreach\u201d under President Joe Biden.",
      "The airline industry has chafed under consumer-protection regulations imposed by the Biden administration. And Delta is facing a federal investigation into its slow recovery from a global technology outage this summer.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian made the comment as he and fellow Delta executives prepared to host Wall Street analysts at an investor day Wednesday in Atlanta.",
      "Bastian noted that President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to reform the federal government and reduce its size.",
      "The airline executive said Trump promised \u201cto take a fresh look at the regulatory environment, the bureaucracy that exists in government, the level of overreach that we have seen over the last four years within our industry. I think that will be a breath of fresh air.\u201d",
      "Southwest Airlines CEO Robert Jordan struck a similar tone after a speech last week in Dallas.",
      "\u201cI think there is a general thought that the new administration could be a little more business-friendly,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWe are hopeful for a DOT (Department of Transportation) that is maybe a little less aggressive in terms of regulating or rule-making.\u201d",
      "Delta used its investor day to build support for the company, which reported a profit of $2.6 billion in the first nine months of this year after earning an industry-leading $4.6 billion last year.",
      "The airline stood by its previous forecast that adjusted profit in the fourth quarter will be between $1.60 and $1.85 per share. The company said its 2025 revenue will rise by a mid-single-digit percentage over 2024. Analysts expect a 6% increase, according to a FactSet survey.",
      "Consumer advocates are wary of a second Trump administration, fearing that it could try to roll back a rule requiring automatic refunds after canceled flights and another that requires airlines to advertise the full price of fares upfront, including mandatory fees and taxes.",
      "On Monday, the airline industry trade group praised Trump's pick for transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin and reality-TV star who is a co-host of \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d on Fox Business. Duffy lobbied for U.S. airlines and their unions during a dispute with Persian Gulf carriers.",
      "But Accountable.US, a watchdog nonprofit group, said putting Duffy in charge of the department that oversees airlines was a sign that Trump is \"putting his friends and their corporate special interests ahead of American consumers.\u201d",

      "The group Airlines for America said the rule would confuse consumers by giving them too much information. An appeals court panel blocked enforcement of the rule while the airlines' lawsuit goes ahead.",
      "Airlines also oppose an inquiry that the administration recently launched into their frequent-flyer programs. Delta has received more than $2.4 billion in revenue from its loyalty program so far this year.",
      "But the hardest blow against Delta could come from a Transportation Department investigation into the airline's slow recovery from a technology outage in July. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said investigators were focusing on whether Delta\u2019s treatment of passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights violated federal consumer-protection rules.",
      "Southwest Airlines reached a $140 million settlement after a Transportation Department investigation into a similar but larger breakdown in service in December 2022.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:14:35 -0500",
    "summary": "A supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants has announced a $60 million expansion in Tennessee, promising more manufacturing of high-tech centrifuges there to enrich uranium",
    "story": [
      "A supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants has announced a $60 million expansion in Tennessee, promising more manufacturing of high-tech centrifuges there to enrich uranium",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- A supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants announced a $60 million expansion in Tennessee on Wednesday, promising to resume and grow its manufacturing of high-tech centrifuges there to enrich uranium at its facility in Ohio.",
      "The expansion by Centrus Energy at its massive facility in Oak Ridge comes as the U.S. ramps up its reliance on nuclear power as a climate change solution. The Tennessee facility, which stretches 440,000 square feet, is where they make and test 40-foot-high centrifuges that will be transported to the company's enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio. The company gave reporters a tour Wednesday, showing off the centrifuges but covering other classified equipment with tarps.",
      "Centrus is one of several companies working on enriching uranium in the U.S., which is currently dependent on foreign providers. Russia has about 44% of the world\u2019s uranium enrichment capacity, supplying some 35% of U.S. imports for nuclear fuel, according to the Department of Energy. Just last week, Russia announced it would temporarily limit its exports of enriched uranium to the U.S. in response to the U.S. deciding to ban Russian uranium starting in 2028.",
      "Western nuclear operators have been looking for suppliers of nuclear fuel other than Russia since it invaded Ukraine in 2022, S&P Global Commodity Insights said Wednesday.",
      "Centrus President and CEO Amir Vexler told reporters Wednesday that the expansion was not due to Russia's decision-making, saying that the company's board approved the plans a few weeks ago. But he said the move illustrates why the U.S. can't depend on other countries for its nuclear fuel.",
      "\u201cNuclear is one of the key essential stabilizers in our sources on the grid. And nuclear fuel is a key essential element of that,\u201d Vexler said. \u201cWhy would you not worry about the security of supply of that key ingredient to our grid?\u201d",
      "The company partners with the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, known for its role as one of the labs that helped develop the atomic bomb. Centrus is expanding in hopes of tapping into a fund of $3.4 billion from the Department of Energy set aside for domestic uranium enrichment. Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, the company currently has about 300 employees, including about 120 in Oak Ridge. The expansion could add 300 more in Oak Ridge.",
      "In the same city, another company, Orano USA, plans to build a uranium enrichment facility.",
      "The Biden administration set a target this month of at least tripling nuclear power in the United States by 2050 to help avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The United States will aim to add 200 gigawatts of new nuclear energy capacity, according to the administration\u2019s new strategy. One gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 to 1 million homes for a year, though the exact amount varies by region and depends on energy use.",
      "The United States currently has 94 operating reactors that produce power without emitting planet-warming greenhouse gases. Nuclear power has provided about one-fifth of the nation\u2019s electricity since the 1990s.",
      "Among the steps to expand nuclear power, the strategy recommends building large gigawatt-scale reactors, constructing small modular reactors and microreactors, extending the lifespan of some existing reactors and working to restart ones that retired for economic reasons. It also recommends improving licensing and developing the nuclear workforce.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he is also interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors.",
      "For a company like Centrus, the business strategy includes producing uranium enriched to levels that are standard in the nuclear power plants operating today, plus at a higher level for the type of commercial small reactors that are being developed in the U.S., though none are under construction yet. Centrus' subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating, was one of four companies awarded a Department of Energy contract aimed at growing the higher-level uranium enrichment.",
      "Some advocates have raised concerns about the more highly enriched uranium.",
      "Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said his group thinks the uranium is enriched enough in the process to make nuclear weapons, and worries about the security of keeping the material from getting into the wrong hands either at enrichment facilities, en route elsewhere or at some of the small reactors still in the works.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that we believe that this material is more dangerous than is currently widely accepted,\u201d Lyman said.",
      "Asked about those kind of concerns, Vexler praised the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as \u201cthe best regulator in the business,\u201d saying regulators ensure the material is safeguarded properly.",

      "North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation at talks in Pyongyang this week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, the North\u2019s state media said Thursday, as they continue to align in the face of their confrontations with Washington.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency didn\u2019t elaborate on the details of the agreement signed Wednesday between its senior trade officials and a Russian delegation led by Alexandr Kozlov, the country\u2019s minister of natural resources and ecology. The Russian news agency Tass on Tuesday said officials following an earlier round of talks agreed to increase the number of charter flights between the countries to promote tourism.",
      "Kozlov, who arrived in North Korea on Sunday, met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his top economic official, Premier Kim Tok Hun, before returning home on Wednesday, KCNA said. During Kozlov\u2019s visit, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s gifted Pyongyang\u2019s Central Zoo with more than 70 animals, including lions, bears and several species of birds, according to Tass, in another display of the countries\u2019 growing ties.",
      "Kim Jong Un in recent months has prioritized relations with Moscow as he attempts to break out of international isolation and strengthen his footing, actively supporting Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine while portraying the North as a player in a united front against Washington.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its fighting against Ukraine. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing on Wednesday that an estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late October were moved to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized parts of its territory this year, following their training in Russia\u2019s northeast.",
      "The spy agency believes the North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the frontlines, said Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have claimed that the North has also been supplying Russia with artillery systems, missiles and other equipment.",
      "North Korea would be possibly getting anywhere between $320 million to $1.3 billion annually from Russia for sending its troops to Ukraine, considering the scale of the dispatch and the level of payments Russia has been providing to foreign mercenaries, according to a recent study by Lim Soo-ho, a South Korean analyst at an NIS-run think tank.",
      "While that would be meaningful income for North Korea\u2019s crippled and heavily sanctioned economy, it could be lower than the money the North earns from illicit coal exports or supplying military equipment to Russia, Lim said. This suggests that North Korea\u2019s troop dispatch is less about money than acquiring key Russian technologies to further advance its nuclear weapons and missile program, which is a major concern in Seoul, Lim said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked. He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:50:28 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly",
      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade.",
      "The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels.",
      "Here's what it all means:",
      "Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's \u201cwildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. \u201cIt would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond search \u2014 that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency\u2019s antitrust division.",
      "Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work.",
      "Justice lawyers called Chrome a \u201cgateway to the internet\u201d that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.",
      "Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge.",
      "Chrome is the world\u2019s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple\u2019s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%.",
      "Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices.",
      "While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open.",
      "The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google\u2019s own general search services.",
      "Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market.",
      "Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It\u2019s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies \u2014 aside from Apple \u2014 have it pre-installed.",
      "The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google.",
      "The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages.",
      "Other key recommendations:",
      "1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",

      "4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",
      "Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day.",
      "The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues.",
      "Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts."

      "The rate rose to 6.84% from 6.78% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. That\u2019s still down from a year ago, when the rate averaged 7.29%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also ticked up this week. The average rate rose to 6.02% from 5.99% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.67%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "When mortgage rates increase they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, reducing homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power at a time when home prices remain near all-time highs, even though U.S. home sales are on track for their worst year since 1995.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to a two-year low of 6.08% in late September but it\u2019s been mostly rising since then, echoing moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which has mostly hovered around 4.4% since last week and was below 3.70% in September, has been rising in recent weeks following mixed reports on inflation and the economy. It also surged after the presidential election, reflecting expectations among investors that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed economic policies may widen the federal deficit and crank up inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates slid to just above 6% in September following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. The central bank\u2019s policy pivot is expected to eventually clear a path for mortgage rates to generally go lower. But that could change if the next administration\u2019s policies send inflation into overdrive again.",
      "September's pullback in mortgage rates helped drive a pickup in sales of previously occupied U.S. homes last month. However, the recent climb in rates has put a damper on the housing market in the near term, said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cMortgage rates reached the high-6% range in late October, and have remained elevated since, much to the disappointment of buyers hoping to find some relief in the late-fall housing market,\u201d she said.",
      "Forecasting the trajectory of mortgage rates is difficult, given that rates are influenced by many factors, from government spending and the economy, to geopolitical tensions and stock and bond market gyrations.",
      "Economists predict that mortgage rates will remain volatile this year, but generally forecast them to hover around 6% in 2025.",

      "Six of the Bengals losses have come by seven points or fewer thanks to some missed field goals in key spots, defensive breakdowns and no go-ahead TD drives by Burrow and the offense in the fourth quarter.",
      "Burrow became the second QB in NFL history to lose consecutive starts when throwing for at least 350 yards and three TDs without an interception in a 34-27 loss to the Chargers on Sunday night. The Bengals rallied from 27-6 down to tie the score in the fourth before Evan McPherson missed two field goals and the Bengals punted in the final minute to set up the Chargers' game-winning drive.",

Goff had his second career game with at least 400 yards, four TDs and the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3, having also done it for the Rams against Minnesota in 2018.",

      "The Steelers became the second team in the last 20 seasons to win multiple games in a season without a TD, joining the 2016 Rams.",
      "In all, Tomlin has won five games in his career in the regular season or playoffs when his team doesn't score a touchdown, one shy of Marv Levy for the most by any coach since 1972. Tomlin's .333 win percentage when his team doesn't score a touchdown ranks first in that span among the 73 coaches who have had at least 10 games without a TD.",

Hill became the first player in NFL history to rush for at least 100 yards and three TDs, have at least 50 yards receiving and throw for at least 10 yards.",
      "He did it by lining up all over the Saints offense with 10 snaps from the slot, eight at quarterback, six as a running back, four as a wide receiver and four as a tight end, according to NFL NextGen Stats. He became the first player in the NGS era beginning in 2016 to have at least four snaps at all five of those positions.",
      "Hill's best work came out of the backfield as he had TD runs of 10, 33 and 75 yards. Only three players since the merger older than Hill (34 years, 86 days) rushed for more yards in a game with John Riggins gaining 165 and 140 in two games at age 35 for Washington in 1984, and 36-year-old MacArthur Lane rushing for 144 yards for Kansas City at Buffalo in 1978.",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is on injured reserve, and the Washington Capitals are coming to grips with playing without their superstar captain for the coming weeks.",
      "Ovechkin is considered week-to-week with a lower left leg injury, and going on IR rules him out for at least the next three games. The absence puts a pause on his pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record and takes the best pure scorer of this generation off the ice until further notice.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the hottest guy in the league, and he\u2019s chasing something bigger than hockey,\u201d longtime teammate Tom Wilson said after practice Wednesday. \u201cI think everyone in the hockey world just feels that bit of letdown, that emotion that you\u2019re just pulling for him and he\u2019s putting everything he has into it. He feels all that pressure. The whole world of hockey is just rooting him on. So, to come in (to the locker room) and see that he was hurt, it hurt a little bit as a teammate, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was injured in a shin-on-shin collision with Utah's Jack McBain on Monday night. The 39-year-old winger went down in obvious pain, then tried to skate and test out the leg minutes later before limping down the tunnel.",
      "Coach Spencer Carbery confirmed it was not a season-ending injury and expects a more specific diagnosis and timeframe to be available Thursday after further evaluation by doctors. Carbery described Ovechkin's initial reaction as \u201cbummed,\" while veteran defenseman John Carlson said Ovechkin was handling it \u201clike a human being,\u201d with plenty of emotions attached.",
      "Even Washington's next opponent isn't thrilled.",
      "\u201cYou never want to see players go down,\u201d said Colorado coach Jared Bednar, whose Avalanche face the Capitals on Thursday night for their second of two meetings over the past week. \"But then you put in a situation like Ovi where he\u2019s chasing greatness, and you want to see him healthy and be able to pursue that: a great start to the season, even getting to the night that he got hurt. Hopefully it\u2019s not long and that he\u2019s able to get back. Injuries are part of it. I think everyone has to deal with them, but I\u2019d certainly like to see him get healthy and continue to pursue that goal.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin scored 15 goals in his first 18 games this season to take the league lead and move 27 back of passing Gretzky. Before the injury, he was on pace to break the record sometime in February.",
      "That likely will have to wait until the spring or perhaps early next season after this injury, which could lead to Ovechkin's longest absence of his two-decade NHL career. He has missed just 59 games total and only 35 because of injury since debuting in 2005.",
      "\u201cI was having a little deja vu about just being in the locker room before we go on the ice and \u2014 almost every time \u2014 he\u2019s there,\u201d Carlson said. \"There\u2019s minutes to be played and goals to be scored.\u201d",
      "The Capitals put Ovechkin on IR and injured winger Sonny Milano on long-term IR with an undisclosed upper-body injury and recalled young Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from Hershey of the American Hockey League. Carbery does not want Miroshnichenko to think he has to fill in for Ovechkin and is still deciding how to proceed with the lineup moving forward.",
      "One possibility on the top line is Jakub Vrana, who along with Ovechkin, Wilson, Carlson and recent trade reacquisition Lars Eller is among the few players remaining from the 2018 Stanley Cup championship team. But it will take more than one player to make up for Ovechkin being out for however long.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to face the reality,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s hard. He\u2019s our captain and everything. But at the same time, it is what it is. And we\u2019re going to prepare on winning games without him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball will test robot umpires as part of a challenge system during spring training at 13 ballparks hosting 19 teams, which could lead to regular-season use in 2026.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 but is still working on the shape of the strike zone.",
      "An agreement for big league use would have to be reached with the Major League Baseball Umpires Association, whose collective bargaining agreement expires Dec. 1.",
      "\u201cI would be interested in having it in \u201826,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday after an owners\u2019 meeting. \u201cWe do have a collective bargaining obligation there. That\u2019s obviously a term and condition of employment. We\u2019re going to have to work through that issue, as well.\u201d",
      "Manfred said the spring training experiment will have to be evaluated before MLB determines how to move forward.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s two sides to that test,\" he said. \"It\u2019s what the clubs think about it and also what do the players think about it? And we\u2019re going to have to sort through both of those.\u201d",
      "Triple-A ballparks used ABS this year for the second straight season, but there is little desire to call the strike zone as the cube defined in the rule book and MLB has experimented with modifications during minor league testing.",
      "The ABS currently calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone was increased to 53.5% of batter height this year from 51%, and the bottom remained at 27%.",
      "After splitting having the robot alone for the first three games of each series and a human with a challenge system in the final three during the first 2 1/2 months of the Triple-A season, MLB on June 25 switched to an all-challenge system in which a human umpire makes nearly all decisions.",
      "During the second half of the season, each team had three challenges in the Pacific Coast League and two in the International League. A team retains its challenge if successful, similar to the regulations for big league teams with video reviews.",
      "\u201cI think we will have a spring training ABS test that will provide a meaningful opportunity for all major league players to see what the challenge system will look like,\u201d Manfred said. \"It won\u2019t be in every single ballpark but we actually have a plan where every team will get meaningful exposure.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The streaking Cleveland Cavaliers tested themselves against the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics and came away with a loss \u2014 and a lot to work on",
      "BOSTON -- This one wasn\u2019t about their perfect season or a 15-game winning streak or even the NBA Cup.",
      "This was a chance for the undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers to see where they stood against the defending champions.",
      "\u201cThis was a great test for us, and unfortunately we didn\u2019t get the win,\u201d said Donovan Mitchell, whose 35 points couldn\u2019t prevent the Cavaliers from picking up their first loss of the season, 120-117 to the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a measuring stick,\u201d said Mitchell, who scored 18 points in the fourth quarter, including 14 straight Cleveland points in the final four minutes. You want to see where you\u2019re at, but not hold too much weight on it. ... We\u2019re not going to be the same team now that we are in April.\"",
      "The Celtics won an unprecedented 18th championship last spring -- rolling over the Cavaliers in five games in the Eastern Conference semis \u2013 and entered the season as the favorites to repeat, or at least make it back to the NBA Finals. Cleveland, which won a playoff series last year for the first time since LeBron James left the second time in 2018, wasn\u2019t expected to be a contender.",
      "But it was the Cavaliers who shot to the top of the standings this fall, with a franchise-record 15-game winning streak that left them as the last unbeaten team in the league. Coach Kenny Atkinson was the first NBA coach ever to win his first 15 games with a new team.",
      "\u201cYou want to be a part of history in that regard. But it\u2019s a thing of the past. It\u2019s over with. And, you know, it was a good run,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt was fun. When you\u2019re playing basketball, good basketball, and obviously winning games -- whether it\u2019s blowouts, close games, come-from-behind wins -- you enjoy these moments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to be part of history. We wish we had kept it going,\u201d he said. \"But, like I said, there\u2019s no championships in November.\u201d",
      "The Celtics used a 3-point barrage on Tuesday night to open a 21-point lead, then watched as the Cavs cut it to two in the third quarter. Cleveland trailed by nine, 114-105, with 90 seconds left before Mitchell hit a floater and then another layup to cut the deficit to five points.",
      "With Boston up 117-110 and 25 seconds left, Mitchell hit a rainbow 3-pointer to make it a four-point game. After Jayson Tatum, who scored 33, hit one of two free throws, the Celtics star bowled Mitchell over while going for a steal.",
      "Mitchell stayed down on the court for a few minutes, but the play was not reviewed to determine if it was a potential flagrant foul that would give the Cavaliers a pair of free throws and the ball.",
      "\"I was just praying to God I didn\u2019t have a concussion. That\u2019s my only thing,\u201d said Mitchell, who watched the play again after the game and didn\u2019t think it should have been ruled a flagrant foul. \u201cIt was a play on the ball. He\u2019s got bony shoulders. So I hit his shoulder, and it is what it is.\u201d",
      "Atkinson blamed himself for not having an answer for a Celtics team that went 14 for 22 from 3-point range in the first half to open a 17-point lead. And he praised his team, which faced the Celtics without Issac Okoro (ankle), Caris LeVert (knee) and DeanWade (ankle), for erasing almost all of that deficit in the third quarter.",
      "\"They shot the heck out of it,\" Atkinson said. \u201cThat big second quarter, that was too much to overcome. Second half, we turned it up, but it\u2019s kind of too late.\u201d",
      "And the coach was already looking to their next matchup, in Cleveland on Dec. 1.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so good. We gave resistance in the second half, but ... a lot of stuff we can improve on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another shot at them soon.\"",

      "It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- As Rafael Nadal prepared to serve in what turned out to be the last tennis match of his career, a woman's voice broke the silence from the stands: \u201cYou make Spain proud!\u201d",
      "Not long after that, Nadal was wiping away tears from his face and waving goodbye to his fans.",
      "His farewell from tennis was as emotional as expected when it came in Malaga on Tuesday, too soon for most. Nadal deliberately set up his swansong on a home court but Spain was eliminated in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and he and they couldn't complete his exalted career with a win.",
      "It was also heart-wrenching for his fans across Spain as they saw one of the country\u2019s very best \u2014 arguably its greatest sportsperson ever \u2014 finally call it quits.",
      "\u201cIt's clear that Rafa is the best athlete ever in Spain. He is on a different level than everyone else, by far,\u201d Feliciano L\u00f3pez, a former tennis player and the tournament director of the Davis Cup Finals, told The Associated Press. \u201cNo disrespect to all other Spanish athletes, and we have very good ones, but no one has been able to inspire the fans the same way that Rafa did.\"",
      "L\u00f3pez, who was Nadal\u2019s teammate in the Davis Cup, compared him to the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, all athletes who transcended sports.",
      "\u201cThere is a very small group of athletes who, during their careers, were able to inspire people in a special way, going beyond sports,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cRafa belongs to this small group. People everywhere in the world will remember Rafa some 40 or 50 years from now.\u201d",
      "Unable to overcome a string of injuries in recent years, the 38-year-old Nadal retired from professional tennis after more than 20 years on tour and 22 Grand Slam titles, two more than Roger Federer and second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic, the only one of the Big Three still playing.",
      "The front pages of Spain\u2019s dailies all talked about Nadal following his farewell match \u2014 a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against No. 80 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cIt was an honor,\u201d the sports daily AS said.",
      "\u201cThank you, Rafa,\u201d Marca headlined.",
      "\u201cEternal,\u201d Mundo Deportivo said.",
      "It's hard to find any other Spanish athlete coming close to Nadal's fame and sporting achievements.",
      "Other Spaniards who have earned sporting greatness include five-time major golf champion Seve Ballesteros; five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Indur\u00e1in, two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol; two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso; six-time MotoGP champion Marc M\u00e1rquez; and four-time Dakar Rally winner Carlos Sainz.",
      "Spain also has a long list of successful soccer players, including World Cup winners Iker Casillas and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, but none with a status like a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have transcended sports like Nadal.",
      "Nadal is also a two-time Olympic champion, and was Spain\u2019s flag-bearer during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "He is adored in Spain just as much for his victories as he is for his passion and unwavering dedication, and is seen as an example for society in general for his values and humbleness on and off the courts.",
      "\u201cNadal makes us Spaniards feel proud. He represents the values of passion, camaraderie, solidarity. He will always be the image of sport in Spain,\" said Clara Garc\u00eda, a 35-year-old fan who was in Malaga to watch Nadal. \u201cIt's not easy knowing that he won't be playing and representing Spain on the courts around the world anymore.\u201d",
      "Federer gushed about his friend and longtime foe's retirement in an open letter. \u201cYou made Spain proud, you made the whole tennis world proud. You have always been a role model for kids around the world.\u201d",
      "Nadal told the crowd in his farewell ceremony after Spain's loss that he always \"strived to be better and achieve my goals from a place of respect, humility, and I valued all the good things that happened to me.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be a good person, which was what mattered the most to me, and I hope that you have noticed that.\"",
      "Fellow tennis pros Djokovic and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer stars David Beckham and other athletes praised Nadal.",
      "\"Thank you for so many incredible moments and memories as a tennis fan and for everything that you have done to inspire young people around the world,\u201d former England and Real Madrid player Beckham said.",
      "\u201cMy goodness, you will be missed,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Carlos Alcaraz, regarded as Nadal's heir in Spanish tennis \u2014 he already has four Grand Slam titles at 21 \u2014 said it will be hard to avoid the inevitable pressure that will come along with following in the footsteps of his idol.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we have to continue his legacy. I don\u2019t want it to be a frustration if we don\u2019t reach the level that he reached,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cIf I achieve half of what he achieved, I will be happy. His legacy is going to be eternal.\u201d",
      "It wasn't quite clear what the future would hold for Nadal, who is an avid golfer and who has always been linked to Real Madrid. He has said in the past he would probably enjoy being the club's president one day.",
      "\u201cMy life will change radically,\u201d Nadal said on Wednesday after arriving home in Mallorca, where he also has the Rafa Nadal Academy. \u201cI have to accept this change as something normal, and accept that my life will be different now than it was for the last 30 years or so. I'm excited about it, there is no doubt.\u201d",
      "One thing was certain: Nadal will never be too far away from tennis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll retire from the sport but I will continue to be available for whatever is needed, and to being a good ambassador, which is what I have tried to do my entire life.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- There are three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen of Red Bull is close to a fourth consecutive world championship, which can wrap up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.",
      "All is not smooth sailing headed into this final month of racing:",
      "\u2014 There's a new race director following the firing of Niels Wittich that blindsided the Grand Prix Drivers' Association so badly that it created an Instagram account to rebuke the lack of FIA transparency.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody,\u201d said Mercedes driver George Russell, a GPDA director. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director (with) just three races left. Often, as drivers, we probably feel like we\u2019re the last to find out this sort of information.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, the company that holds the commercial rights to F1, said last week he was stepping down from his position. This followed months of speculation that owner John Malone was displeased with Liberty landing in two different Justice Department investigations, one surrounding F1's refusal to allow Andretti Global into the series and the other over allegations of a Live Nation concert ticket monopoly.",
      "The Andretti team is expected to receive F1 approval to join the grid, albeit without Michael Andretti, who has scaled back his role dramatically since the IndyCar season ended in September.",
      "\u2014 F1 denied over the weekend that Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Management, was also on the move amid rumors that the Italian would take over MotoGP if Liberty's purchase of the series is approved.",
      "\u2014 Renee Wilm, a longtime Liberty Media employee, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and potentially Domenicali's successor, told The Associated Press she will fulfill any role Malone tasks her with but has little desire to move from Colorado to London to replace Domenicali. Maffei's newly opened job? Who knows.",
      "Many drivers, particularly seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, have been at odds with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem since his election following the 2021 season finale. In the GDPA statement, they reminded the sanctioning body \u201cour members are adults\u201d who don't need lectures and fines on foul language or jewelry bans, and simply want fair and consistent race control.",
      "There's been no response from Ben Sulayem, and won't be this weekend since he does not attend the LVGP. He will be at Qatar and the finale in Abu Dhabi next month.",
      "Hamilton doesn't think all the behind-the-scenes changes will be a fan topic as the season comes to a close. But he noted that consistency from race control is all the drivers have asked for, while throwing his support behind Domenicali and the job Maffei has done in growing F1 since Liberty took over.",
      "\u201cI really hope Stefano is not leaving because he's been so instrumental in changes and progress to this whole thing,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cAnd he knows the sport as well as anyone. But all good things do come to an end, and whoever they put into place, I just hope they are like-minded. But sometimes you have to shake the trees.\u201d",
      "That's just what happened with the surprise departure of race director Wittich. Although drivers have been unhappy with race officiating this season and held a private GPDA meeting in Mexico City, Russell said they had no prior warning Wittich was out.",
      "The race director is the referee each weekend and Wittich has been in charge since 2022, when Michael Masi was fired following the controversial 2021 season-ending, championship-altering finale at Abu Dhabi. Now the man in charge for the final three races is Rui Marques, the Formula 2 and Formula 3 race director.",
      "Las Vegas, which overcame multiple stumbling blocks in last year's debut before putting on one of the best races of the season, is a difficult place to start. Verstappen can win his fourth title by simply scoring three points more than Lando Norris of McLaren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit weird with three races to go to do that,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re positive or negative about certain things. I thought in Brazil there was definitely room for improvement, for example. It\u2019s still a bit weird having to now then deal with a different race director.\u201d",
      "Charles Leclerc of Ferrari wondered why the move was made with only three races to go.",
      "\u201cTo do it so late in the season, at such a crucial moment of the season, it could have probably been managed in a better way,\u201d he said.",
      "The drivers have consistently asked for clearer guidelines in the officiating of races, specifically regarding track limits and racing rules. The drivers have no idea how Marques will officiate, highlighting a disconnect between the competitors and Ben Sulaymen's FIA.",
      "\u201cWe just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening,\u201d Russell said. \u201cAnd I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations.\u201d",
      "The GDPA statement made clear the drivers do not think their voice is being heard.",
      "\u201cIf we feel we\u2019re being listened to, and some of the changes that we are requesting are implemented, because ultimately we\u2019re only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a number of drivers who feel a bit fed up with the whole situation. It only seems to be going in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "He also said the relationship between the drivers and the FIA seems fractured.",
      "\u201cSometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to work together to improve the problem.\u201d",
      "Norris, who has battled Verstappen this year with mixed officiating rulings, said \u201cobviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want.\u201d",
      "Marques has his first driver meeting ahead of Thursday night's two practice sessions and then three weeks to prove to the competitors he is up for the job.",
      "Carlos Sainz Jr., who will leave Ferrari for Williams at the end of the season, hopes the drama doesn't distract from the momentum F1 has built over the last five years.",
      "\u201cI think Formula 1 is in a great moment right now and all these rumors, I think in every team, every job, there's job changes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not big drama. I'm a big fan of the people you mentioned, they've done an incredible job in Formula 1 and Formula 1 is what it is thanks to these people. But it's just so emotional, especially the Stefano one. The only one that has a real effect is the race director. But I think if he does a good job, it should be transparent and nothing big.\u201d",

They said the teens\u2019 school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.",
      "Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.",
      "The law, signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in July, bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students\u2019 birth certificates \u201cor other evidence.\u201d",
      "Sununu had said it \u201censures fairness and safety in women\u2019s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.\u201d About half of states have adopted similar measures.",
      "In the second case Thursday, a judge heard from parties involved in a school district dispute in Bow over a decision to bar parents from wearing pink wristbands with \u201cXX\u201d \u2014 representing the female chromosomes \u2014 at a girls high school soccer game in September. The parents sued the district.",
      "Parker Tirrell, one of the transgender girls challenging the state ban on participation, was playing on the opposing team that day.",
      "The district issued no-trespass orders banning two parents from school grounds because they wore the wristbands. Those orders have since expired, but at issue Thursday was whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re self-censoring, with good reason because they\u2019ve been censored before, and defendants say they\u2019re going to do it again,\u201d said the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, Endel Kolde. He pointed at a court document in which school district officials said they are justified in viewing the wristbands as targeting transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events.",
      "\u201cThis is viewpoint discrimination, and it\u2019s very clear they\u2019re proud of it,\u201d he said.",
      "Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech \u201cto some degree\u201d in order to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge\u2019s claim that yelling \u201ctransgender students out\u201d at a particular player would be subject to such regulation.",
      "\u201cIt might be,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to get you to concede the obvious,\u201d Judge Steven McAuliffe said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s less than obvious to me,\u201d Kolde said.",
      "The first witness was plaintiff Kyle Fellers, who said he purchased the pink wristbands thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said \u201cProtect women\u2019s sports for female athletes.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to support women\u2019s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,\u201d he said.",
      "His attorney played video recorded by a town police officer showing his interactions with Fellers at the game, including Fellers calling school officials \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201cNazis.\u201d Under questioning by his attorney, Fellers said had no problem with transgender people outside of the issue of their participation in sports.",
      "School district officials said they acted appropriately.",
      "The district \u201cproperly exercised its duty to protect Parker Tirrell from intimidation and harassment during the game,\u201d it said in a court document.",
      "It also said it issued reasonable sanctions\u201d against the two parents \u201cfor conduct they knew violated the school\u2019s policies governing athletic events.\u201d"

      "Rafael Nadal's retirement from tennis serves as a reminder that for all of his Grand Slam titles and other successes, his greatest legacy might be the qualities that inspired Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek and other younger players",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- Not surprisingly, Rafael Nadal couldn\u2019t take a step around the grounds of the Davis Cup Final 8 in recent days without hearing requests for a handshake or a selfie. And that was just from the other professional tennis players, to speak nothing of the fans.",
      "The significance of Nadal\u2019s retirement is lost on no one inside or outside the sport he is walking away from at age 38 after a litany of injuries, and for all of the well-documented success he enjoyed, his greatest legacy might be the way he inspired other players. The 22-time Grand Slam champion and all-time great of the game lost the last match of his career as Spain was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals as Tuesday turned to Wednesday.",
      "The last man to face \u2014 and beat \u2014 Nadal, 80th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, who is 29, spoke after his 6-4, 6-4 victory about idolizing the Spaniard. Many current players grew up watching Nadal, admiring him for his skill \u2014 from the big, topspin left-handed forehands to the pinpoint volleys and everything in between \u2014 and his relentless nature, his commitment to seeking improvement and, maybe most of all, his off-court humility.",
      "He set an example for others, from contemporaries Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic or Serena Williams, to members of the following generations, including heir apparent Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cI was a big Rafa fan. Used to wear all his kits, his shoes, everything. A lot of neon colors,\u201d said Ben Shelton, a 22-year-old member of the U.S. team that faces Australia on Thursday, when the other quarterfinal is defending champion Italy and No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner against Argentina. \u201cAnd being a lefty, he\u2019s a guy that I have always kind of watched and tried to learn things from. One of those perfect examples of how to do things on and off the court, how to handle the press, how to win with class, how to lose with class.\u201d",
      "That sentiment was echoed by player after player, many of whom were thrilled to be on-site for his farewell.",
      "\u201cFor him to have this as his finishing point, it\u2019s an honor for the event,\" said Yannick Hanfmann, part of the German squad that defeated Canada 2-0 on Wednesday and will meet the Netherlands in the semifinals on Friday. \"He\u2019s present everywhere. In the training area, when he\u2019s walking around, you see the people looking and trying to get some pictures, here and there. He\u2019s got this aura that already was big, but now that this is the end, it\u2019s maybe more important.\u201d",
      "Hanfmann and others were struck by Nadal's dedication to chasing every shot down. By a refusal to accept defeat, no matter the deficit. By his longevity and consistency \u2014 nearly 18 full years in a row ranked in the top 10; 10 consecutive years with at least one major title \u2014 and his dizzying peaks, including the 14 French Open championships that earned him the \u201cKing of Clay\u201d nickname.",
      "His unfailing politeness, seen in such gestures as when he would say goodbye to every volunteer on his way out of a tournament or, just this Monday, when he arrived at Spain\u2019s team news conference and made a beeline for the stenographer to shake the hand of the person who would be typing up the transcript of the Q-and-A session for reporters.",
      "\u201c The titles, the numbers, are there, so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is as a good person from a small village in Mallorca,\u201d Nadal said during a tear-filled post-match ceremony at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena, where thousands serenaded him with a chorus of \u201cRaaaa-faaa! Raaaa-faaa!\u201d",
      "\u201cJust a kid that followed their dreams,\u201d he said, \u201c (and) worked as hard as possible.\u201d",
      "No opponent, or any observer for that matter, could ever question his effort, even as injury after injury made things tougher, especially over the past two seasons.",
      "No one ever doubted his drive to get better.",
      "\"I really will miss watching him on court,\u201d said Iga Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion and long an unabashed fan of Nadal\u2019s. \u201cHonestly, he was the only player I watched, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to watch tennis at all now. He\u2019s a huge inspiration.\u201d",
      "That last word, or a variation of it, was used over and over again as tributes to Nadal were offered.",
      "So were \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cpassion,\u201d \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201crole model.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alcaraz, a 21-year-old Spaniard with four major trophies, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to accept that Rafael Nadal is going to retire, honestly.\u201d",

      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture. But, more than a year later, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make \u201cGlicked\u201d \u2014 or even \u201cBabyratu\u201d \u2014 happen.",
      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "Looking for a new social media platform",
      "LONDON -- Looking for a new social media platform because X, Threads and Mastodon just aren't cutting it? You could try Bluesky.",
      "People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls.",
      "The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk\u2019s X and similar platforms.",
      "If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works:",
      "Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem \u2014 you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public.",
      "You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.)",
      "If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social.",
      "You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away.",
      "Bluesky boasts that it gives users \u201calgorithmic choice\u201d to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system.",
      "\u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,\u201d it says.",
      "What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button.",
      "There's also the usual \u201cDiscover\u201d feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow.",
      "To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don\u2019t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online.",
      "Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts.",
      "What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky. But check before clicking the follow button to make sure it's not a different user using the same display name or handle.",
      "Ready to join the conversation? You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters \u2014 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too.",
      "You can still @ people by typing in their username, like posts by tapping a heart icon or use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a menu to hashtags, so when you click on one you'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on that topic.",
      "Bluesky's decentralization ethos extends to the content control options it offers.",
      "For starters, users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies, reposts or quote posts in their feed. Specific words or tags can be muted temporarily, or forever, while accounts can be muted or blocked individually, or in bulk by adding them a moderation list. You can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed.",
      "Bluesky has a team of content moderators to police the site for material that's illegal or breaks the rules. But it's also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says \u201clack transparency and user control.\u201d",
      "So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers. These labelers can be used to categorize content or users, which can then be blocked or hidden. But they could also be used for informational or creative purposes, like curating or verifying content.",
      "There are labelers to identify images generated by artificial intelligence or to fact check news posts. You can find lists of labelers online. After I subscribed to a U.S. politics labeler, some posts in my feeds were flagged \u201c!Donald Trump\u201d or \u201c!Democrat politician\u201d and hidden unless I click Show.",

    "story": [
      "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.",
      "For the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.",
      "Nvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.",
      "Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia\u2019s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.",
      "Analysts\u2019 were eyeing Nvidia\u2019s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.",
      "Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.",
      "On an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems \u201chave certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery customer is racing to be the first to market,\u201d Kress said. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\u201d",
      "The company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver \u201cmore Blackwells than we had previously estimated\u201d this quarter, Huang added.",
      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.",
      "Nvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was \u201ca little bit disappointing,\u201d said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had \u201ca tremendous quarter.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,\u201d Volpe said.",
      "Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.",
      "Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows \u201cthe AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBlackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.\u201d",
      "Through the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it\u2019s large and diverse.\u201d"

      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you've heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Crypto industry players have welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, recently pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "How of this will actually pan out \u2014 and whether or not Trump will successfully act quickly on these promises \u2014 has yet to be seen.",
      "\u201cThis is not necessarily a short-term story, it\u2019s likely a much longer-term story,\" Citi macro strategist David Glass told The Associated Press last week. \"And there is the question of how quickly can U.S. crypto policy make a serious impact on (wider adoption).\u201d",
      "Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, thinks the industry is craving \u201cjust some sort of clarity.\u201d Much of the approach to regulating crypto in the past has been \u201cenforcement based,\u201d he notes, which has been helpful in weeding out some bad actors \u2014 but legislation might fill in other key gaps.",
      "Gary Gensler, who as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden has led a U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry, penalized a number of crypto companies for violating securities laws. Gensler announced Thursday that he would step down as SEC chair on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.",
      "Despite crypto\u2019s recent excitement around Trump, McCarthy said that 2024 has already been a \u201chugely consequential year for regulation in the U.S.\u201d \u2014 pointing to January\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, which mark a new way to invest in the asset.",
      "Spot ETFs have been the dominant driver of bitcoin for some time now \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. According to Kaiko, bitcoin ETFs recorded $6 billion in trade volume for the week of the election alone.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. In theory, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term. Others note it may be too early to tell.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes. And in late 2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.",
      "While its been a big month for crypto \u2014 and particularly bitcoin, which McCarthy notes has set record highs for ten of the last 21 days \u2014 there's always risk for \u201ccorrection,\" or seeing prices fluctuate back down some. Some assets may also have more restrictions than others.",
      "\u201cI would say, keep it simple. And don\u2019t take on more risk than you can afford to,\" McCarthy said \u2014 adding that there isn't a \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d to know for certain what comes next.",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\u201d which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections",

    "summary": "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
    "story": [
      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:30:39 -0500",

      "Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought",
      "NEW YORK -- Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought.",
      "Astronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can't see it and they don't know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy.",
      "It is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe \u2014 while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%.",
      "But findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer.",
      "\u201cI did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,\u201d said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope southwest of Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe over 11 billion years to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading.",
      "The map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers' standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought \u2014 or that there may be something else altogether going on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research.",
      "The collaboration's latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein's general relativity predicted.",
      "The new findings aren't definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls.",
      "\u201cThe significance of this result right now is tantalizing,\u201d said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, \"but it's not like a gold-plated measurement.\"",
      "There\u2019s a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe\u2019s fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it\u2019s growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it\u2019ll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip.",
      "\u201cNot to panic. If this is what\u2019s going on, it won\u2019t happen for billions of years,\" he said. \u201cBut we'd like to know about it.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 19, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 20, 2024 to correct the location of the telescope used by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. It is southwest of Tucson, Arizona, not in Tucson. It also corrects the description of the instrument's three-dimensional map of the universe. The telescope mapped how the universe evolved over 11 billion years, but the universe is about 13.7 billion years old.",

      "GRINDAVIK, Iceland -- A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has roared back to life after eight centuries of silence has erupted for the seventh time since December, sending molten lava flowing towards the Blue Lagoon spa, a major tourist attraction.",
      "The eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. (2314 GMT) Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, according to Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity.",

      "While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindav\u00edk, which was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",

      "The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindav\u00edk, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and had a population before the eruptions of 3,800, have damaged infrastructure and property, forcing many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety.",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

      "The U.S. leads the world in developing artificial intelligence technology, surpassing China in research and other important measures of AI innovation, according to a newly released Stanford University index.",
      "There's no surefire way to rank global AI leadership but Stanford researchers have made an attempt by measuring the \u201cvibrancy\u201d of the AI industry across various dimensions, from how much research and investment is happening to how responsibly the technology is being pursued to prevent harm.",
      "\u201cThe gap is actually widening\u201d between the U.S. and China, said computer scientist Ray Perrault, director of the steering committee that runs Stanford's AI Index. \u201cThe U.S. is investing a lot more, at least at the level of firm creation and firm funding.\u201d",
      "The California-based university's Institute for Human-Centered AI \u2014 which has ties to Silicon Valley's tech industry \u2014 released the report Thursday as government AI officials from the U.S. and several allies met in San Francisco this week to compare notes on AI safety measures.",
      "Here's which countries made the top 10:",
      "The U.S. ranks No. 1 on Stanford's list and has consistently held that position since 2018 when it overtook China. It has far outpaced China in private AI investment, which hit $67.2 billion in the U.S. last year compared to $7.8 billion in China, according to the report. It also leads in publishing responsible AI research. It's no surprise that the home of commercial AI powerhouses such as Google and Meta, along with relative newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, has produced many notable AI models that have influenced how the technology is being developed and applied. The U.S. also gets some points for having a number of AI-related laws on the books, though Congress has yet to pass any broad AI regulations.",
      "China has requested far more patents than any other country regarding generative AI, the U.N. intellectual property agency said earlier this year. Stanford researchers counted that as one measure of China's strong growth in AI innovation but not enough to lead the pack. Still, the report says that \"China\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies and increasing its R&D investments has positioned it as a major AI powerhouse.\u201d China's universities have produced a large number of AI-related research publications and it has commercial leaders developing notable AI models, such as Baidu and its chatbot Ernie.",
      "Coming in at No. 3 is the UK, which also ranked high in research and development, and educational infrastructure due to top computer science universities churning out a skilled AI workforce. It's also home to Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind, whose co-founder recently won a Nobel Prize; and \u201chad more mentions of AI in parliamentary proceedings\u201d than any other country. Last year, the UK hosted the world\u2019s first international AI safety summit.",
      "Close behind the UK was India, thanks to a \u201cstrong AI research community,\u201d improvements in economic investments tied to AI and a robust public discourse about AI on social media, according to the report.",
      "The UAE's deliberate focus on AI appears to have paid off in the Middle Eastern nation's fifth-place score. It was one of the top locations for AI investments. Microsoft earlier this year said it was investing $1.5 billion in UAE-based tech firm G42, which is overseen by the country\u2019s powerful national security adviser. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers and has built what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 are France at No. 6, followed by South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore. France, home to the buzzy AI startup Mistral, ranked high in AI policy and governance. Both it and Germany are part of the European Union's sweeping new AI Act that places safeguards on a range of AI applications based on how risky they are. The EU also follows the U.S. in developing a plan to expand semiconductor production within the bloc.",

      "The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels.",
      "Here's what it all means:",
      "Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's \u201cwildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. \u201cIt would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond search \u2014 that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency\u2019s antitrust division.",
      "Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work.",
      "Justice lawyers called Chrome a \u201cgateway to the internet\u201d that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.",

      "The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google\u2019s own general search services.",
      "Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market.",

      "1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.4.

      "A sale of Chrome \u201cwill permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.",
      "Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct.",

      "Wary of Google\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google\u2019s AI training techniques.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn\u2019t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\u201d Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year\u2019s trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta\u2019s ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department\u2019s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google, and the recommendation that Android should be completely walled off from the company's own search engine.",
      "\u201cIt is probably going a little beyond,\u201d Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. \u201cThe remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.\u201d",
      "Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist.",
      "\u201cUndoing Google\u2019s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,\u201d Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "story": [
      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "Among the new objectives that were achieved: igniting one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines in space, which would be necessary when returning from orbit. There were also thermal protection experiments aboard the spacecraft, with some areas stripped of heat tiles to see whether catch mechanisms might work there on future flights.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:46:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Ukraine this week launched U.S.-made missiles at targets inside Russia.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. officials said it was an intermediate-range ballistic missile.",
      "LONDON and KYIV -- Russia on Thursday launched what officials in Kyiv said was an intercontinental ballistic missile toward southeastern Ukraine, but a U.S. official told ABC News that Russia launched \"an experimental medium-range ballistic missile against Ukraine\" near Dnipro.",
      "The official said the United States briefed Ukraine and other close allies and partners in recent days on Russia's possible use of this weapon in order to help them prepare. According to the official, Russia likely only possesses \"a handful\" of these experimental missiles.",
      "Two U.S. officials previously told ABC News it was not an ICBM but instead an intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM.",
      "The launch raises the prospect of nuclear weapons; IRBMs or ICBMs can both be equipped with nuclear warheads. A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the ballistic missile Russia fired at Dnipro contained MIRVs, or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, meaning it had multiple warheads that hit the target. MIRV technology is used in ICBMs to use multiple nuclear warheads atop the missile so they can strike multiple targets. The missile used Thursday did not carry nuclear warheads.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin, in remarks Thursday following the missile launch, said Russia has the right to use its weapons against the military facilities of countries employing their weapons against Russia.",
      "\"We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against military objects of those countries that allow to use their own weapons against our objects.\u00a0In the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond decisively and in a mirror manner,\" Putin said.",
      "Putin said Russia used \"one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems\" in an attack on Ukraine, adding that it was a \"ballistic missile with a non-nuclear hypersonic equipment\" and that the \"test was successful.\"",
      "Russia warned the U.S. 30 minutes before the launch of its new \"Oreshnik\" missile against targets in Dnipro, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news outlet TASS.",
      "The Kremlin announced earlier this week that Putin had updated the country's nuclear doctrine, a move that lowered the bar for Russia to respond with nuclear weapons. Russian ICBMs are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, although it appeared the missile fired on Thursday was not equipped with one.",
      "Ukraine's military was \"95% sure\" the strike on Thursday was with an ICBM, a Ukrainian official told ABC News, but added that they were still examining the missile parts on the ground and had not yet reached a final conclusion.",
      "\"Today it was a new Russian missile. All the parameters: speed, altitude -- match those of an intercontinental ballistic missile,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement on social media. \"All expert evaluations are underway.\"",
      "The Ukrainian Air Force announced Thursday morning it had tracked the launch of the ICBM, along with six additional missiles, all of which were targeting the Dnipro region. The ICBM appeared to have been launched from the Astrahan region, in Russia's southwest, Ukrainian military officials said.",
      "All of the missiles were launched in about two hours, beginning at about 5 a.m. local time, Ukraine said.",
      "All were targeted at businesses and critical infrastructure, but only the missile that Ukraine identified as an ICBM struck the city, Ukraine said. The six other missiles were shot down. There were no reports of casualties or significant damage, officials said.",
      "The U.S. officials said the assessment of the launch, the type of missile and warhead, and the damage in Dnipro was continuing.\u00a0The distance from what Ukraine said was the launch point to the strike location in Dnipro is about 600 miles, a distance shorter than what an ICBM would be expected to travel.",
      "Two experts told ABC News the projectile, seen in video circulating online, looks likely to be \"a ballistic missile with MIRV-ed capabilities.\"",
      "The launch of an ICBM, if confirmed as such, would arrive amid concerns that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could further escalate. This week, Ukraine's military for the first time launched U.S.-made ATACMS missiles toward targets within Russia, days after U.S. President Joe Biden allowed for such use of the long-range weapons.",
      "Putin, in his remarks Thursday, blamed the U.S. for escalating the conflict, saying: \"I would like to emphasize once again that it was not Russia, but the United States that destroyed the international security system. And by continuing to fight, cling to their hegemony, they are pushing the whole world into a global conflict.\"",
      "Kyiv on Tuesday launched six of the ATACMS at targets within Russian territory, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Zelenskyy\u00a0said he would not confirm if Ukraine had used ATACMS to conduct a strike on an ammunition depot in the Bryansk region of Russia, but said Ukraine has ATACMS and \"will use all of these\" against Russia.",
      "Within hours of Russia announcing it had struck down five of the ATACMS on Tuesday, the Kremlin announced that Putin had updated the country's nuclear doctrine.",
      "Following that warning, Ukraine on Wednesday fired long-range British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia for the first time, a Ukrainian military unit involved in the operation told ABC News. At least 10 of those missiles hit an estate in the village of Marino, the unit said.",
      "They were targeting a command post where North Korean army generals and officers were present, the unit said. More than 10,000 North Korean troops are said to be operating alongside Russian forces in the Kursk region.",
      "Ukraine's 413th Separate Unmanned Systems Battalion, which helped provide fire control for the strikes, told ABC News that there was intelligence showing high-ranking North Koreans were present.",
      "Zelenskyy cast the Russian strike on Thursday as a result of Russia and its leader being \"terrified.\"",
      "\"Obviously, Putin is terrified when normal life simply exists next to him. When people simply have dignity. When a country simply wants to be and has the right to be independent,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Putin is doing whatever it takes to prevent his neighbor from breaking free of his grasp.\"",

    "story": [
      "Brazil\u2019s federal police have indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people on charges of attempting a coup to keep him in office after his electoral defeat in the 2022 elections",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil\u2019s federal police said Thursday they indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people for allegedly attempting a coup to keep him in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections.",
      "Police said their findings were being delivered Thursday to Brazil's Supreme Court, which must decide whether to refer them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will either formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial, or toss the investigation.",
      "The former right-wing president has denied all claims he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his rival, leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has faced a series of legal threats since then.",
      "Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted \u201cto avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.\u201d The 700-page police document likely will take several days for the court to review, Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes said.",
      "Dozens of former and current Bolsonaro aides also were indicted, including Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who was his running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander Gen. Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno.",
      "The investigation started last year. On Tuesday, four military men and one federal police agent were arrested as part of the same probe.",
      "Other investigations focus on Bolosnaro's potential roles in smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil without properly declaring them, and in directing a subordinate to falsify his and others\u2019 COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement in either.",
      "Another probe found that he had abused his authority to cast doubt on the country's voting system, and judges barred him from running again until 2030.",
      "The far-reaching investigations have weakened Bolsonaro's status as a leader of Brazil's right wing, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cBolsonaro is already barred from running in the 2026 elections,\u201d Melo told the The Associated Press.",
      "\"And if he is convicted he could also be jailed by then. To avoid being behind bars, he will have to convince Supreme Court justices that he has nothing to do with a plot that involves dozens of his aids. That's a very tall order,\u201d Melo said.",
      "On Tuesday, the federal police arrested four military and a federal police officer accused of plotting to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections, including alleged plans to kill Lula and other top officials.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:41:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump is seeking to cash in on his election win by selling new merchandise like Trump Boots and Trump Coins, but experts say there could be conflicts of interest.",
    "story": [
      "Trump has made millions from licensing his name and image for profit.",
      "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump hawked apparel and keepsakes promoting his presidential bid in what experts ABC spoke with characterized as an unprecedented effort to commoditize his political platform.",
      "Now, after his triumph at the polls, the president-elect is again seeking to cash in on his personal brand with a fresh line of goods, from a pair of $299 \"Trump Landslide\" boots to a $69.99 special inaugural edition of his God Bless the USA Bible.",
      "As the former president prepares to return to the Oval Office, experts warned that the opaque structure of the companies that produce these items could create fresh conflicts of interest for Trump -- with few public details about who Trump is in business with and how much he profits.",
      "\"We've never seen a president merchandise like this,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"",
      "Compared to his $3 billion stake in his social media company and his multimillion-dollar buildings, Trump's licensing deals comprise only a fraction of his portfolio -- but his opaque deals can be ethical \"black boxes\" that escape outside scrutiny according to Libowitz.",
      "Without knowing who the president-elect is in business with, it's impossible to know if he might use the power of his office to help his bottom line or benefit his business partners or whoever is contributing money to him, Libowitz said.",
      "Trump has entered into the licensing agreements through two companies -- CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC -- that are fully owned by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. According to a 2023 financial disclosure, Trump made more than $7 million though CIC Digital LLC, which entered a licensee agreement for the sale of nonfungible tokens or NFTs.",
      "Trump used CIC Ventures LLC to make more than $5 million through bible and book sales, and information is not yet public about how much Trump has made from other deals like his watches and shoes.",
      "Those companies quickly launched new items following Trump's electoral victory. Trump Sneakers unveiled a full line of \"Trump Won\" footwear, including a gold pair of low-top sneakers for $499. Trump Coins unveiled a one-ounce \"Victory Gold Medallion\" -- with the president-elect's face and signature pressed in solid gold -- for $3,645.47, a thousand-dollar upcharge compared to the price of an ounce of gold. And Trump Watches unveiled a \"Victory Collection\" priced between $599 and $1,299.",
      "\"Donald Trump proved his greatest skill was as a salesman, selling mostly junk products, and he hasn't stopped,\" said Robert Weissman, co-president of the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump announced a new plan to sell electric and acoustic guitars with a company called \"Trump Guitars.\"",
      "The instruments -- which include the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" in pearl inlay -- start at $1,250. A limited version of the guitars signed by Trump is on sale for $11,250. Details about where the guitars are made and how much profit, if any, Trump makes from the sales, were not immediately available, and Trump Guitars did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Items like Trump sneakers and watches are distinct from the merchandise Trump sells through his campaign website, which offers everything from Make America Great Again hats to Christmas ornaments. The profit from those purchases goes toward Trump's joint fundraising committee, which is subject to rigorous reporting requirements for political contributions.",
      "But the external companies that Trump licenses to sell his other items aren't subject to oversight. It's an approach that Trump has taken for decades: Making money from his brand by selling everything from steaks to vodka with limited involvement, by outsourcing the design, production, and distribution of the goods under license to separate companies, about which little is often known.",
      "For someone in power, like the president, that arrangement can create \"areas of potential concern,\" according to Weissman.",
      "Details about the terms of Trump's agreements with the merchandise companies -- such as JBCZ Group LLC for his coins or TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC for his watches -- are not public, and the LLCs are registered in states that offer few details about the companies' ownership.",
      "Some of Trump's merchandise -- such as his NFTs or watches -- also sell for wildly high prices that create an avenue for individuals, including potentially foreign actors, to channel money to Trump, according to Libowitz. Trump Watches is currently offering a \"Trump Victory Tourbillon\" watch for $100,000.",
      "\"That kind of seems like it is a way to put money directly in his pockets,\" said Libowitz, who believes the watch is likely worth a fraction of its asking price. \"It's an opportunity to give money directly to him and let him know that.\"",
      "Trump Watches, Trump Coins, Trump Sneakers, and God Bless The USA Bible did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, and nor did a spokesperson for Trump's transition team.",
      "When Trump entered the White House in 2017, he resigned as the trustee of Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and passed control to his sons and a business partner to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The setup allowed Trump to still profit from his businesses while relinquishing control of day-to-day operations and decisions.",
      "While he regained control of the Trust when he left office in 2021, it's expected that he'll again hand over control when he returns to office in January -- although experts say the arrangement is unlikely to shed additional light on his licensing deals.",
      "\"He's not constrained by any norms or regulations,\" said Weissman. \"He'll disclose what he wants to disclose.\"",
      "And with Trump's presidency two months away, watchdog groups worry that weak enforcement of ethics rules could become pervasive throughout the federal government if Trump doesn't set a strong example.",
      "\"This kind of thing trickles down,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the nonprofit Project on Government Accountability. \"It would be great to lead from the top.\"",

      "At the confirmation hearing in 2009, she said education was her passion and that her work as CEO of the WWE taught her \"firsthand the skills Connecticut students need to obtain through education to be successful.\"",

      "According to his Agenda47 policy platform, Trump's top education priorities do include eliminating the Department of Education. They also include expanding school voucher programs and giving more power to parents in classrooms.",
      "School \"choice\" has been a key proponent of conservative education policy in recent years, aiming to expand \"education savings\" policies so that families can redirect public school funding toward private schools or homeschooling.",
      "Arizona passed the country\u2019s first of such program in 2011, and at least eight other states have followed its lead: Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia.",
      "However, voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of program.",
      "As head of the Department of Education, McMahon would oversee federal policies impacting millions of students in the U.S.",

      "Trump's recess appointments demand seems to be meeting resistance with senators.",
      "As controversy continues to cloud some of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks, his team has an ominous warning for Republicans who don't fall in line behind his nominees.",
      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reports that one senior Trump adviser said the message to lawmakers is, \"If you are on the wrong side of the vote, you're buying yourself a primary.\"",
      "\"That is all,\" the adviser told Karl. \"And there's a guy named Elon Musk who is going to finance it.\"",
      "\"The president gets to decide his Cabinet. No one else,\" the adviser added.",
      "The threat came as Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth (tapped for attorney general and defense secretary, respectively) made the rounds on Capitol Hill this week to shore up support. They were escorted by Vice President-elect JD Vance, the junior senator from Ohio.",
      "Gaetz announced Thursday afternoon he was withdrawing his name from consideration, stating his confirmation bid was \"unfairly becoming a distraction.\"",
      "Gaetz faces allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he's long denied, that was the subject of a federal investigation and a House Ethics Committee probe. Hegseth has been accused of sexual assaulting a woman in 2017, an encounter Hegseth told police was consensual.",
      "Trump stood firm with the selections, which also raised eyebrows for their relative lack of experience to lead the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense. Trump said it was ultimately Gaetz's choice to withdraw.",
      "Some of the president-elect's other picks have similarly faced scrutiny over their qualifications, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "Trump previously made a demand for Republican leadership to back so-called \"recess appointments\" to skirt the traditional confirmation process. That route would require lawmakers to adjourn and for senators to give up the \"advice and consent\" role they play in nominations, as laid out in the Constitution.",
      "But his demand is being met with some resistance from some Senate Republicans.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a senior Republican and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said recess appointments for Cabinet posts should be \"absolutely off the table.\"",
      "\"And quite honestly, any serious candidate for Cabinet-level position, I would really have to wonder if they would want it or be willing to accept it under a recess,\" Tillis said. \"These positions are too important. They carry too much weight internationally to take a short cut.\"",
      "Several senators have said they want the full \"process\" and vetting of candidates to play out.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley said on Wednesday his intention is to vote for all nominees.",
      "\"The Constitution gives us a role in personnel called advice and consent. My view is that's exactly what will unfold here when these nominees are actually sent forward, and we'll treat them like we've treated all others with the proper vetting,\" said longtime Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who recently stepped down from the role.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:25:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump tapped Dr. Oz to lead the CMS. Could changes be coming to Medicare and Medicaid, which are run by the federal government?",
    "story": [
      "Oz has supported Medicare Advantage, which is run by private insurers.",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump's recent announcement of former surgeon-turned-TV host Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), questions are swirling about whether changes could be coming to the government programs.",
      "If his nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Oz would, as CMS administrator, oversee Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. At least 145 million Americans are enrolled under one of the three programs, according to federal data.",
      "Oz has previously expressed support for an option that could lead to more Medicare privatization. Although Oz has not revealed his views on Medicaid, some Republicans in Congress have expressed support for changes that would slash the budget of the program.",
      "Making Medicare Advantage the default",
      "CMS\u00a0administers Medicare, the federal health insurance program for those mostly aged 65 and older. More than 66 million people in the U.S. receive coverage through Medicare, the program says.",
      "However, Oz has expressed support for Medicare Advantage, a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurance companies. The plan must follow rules set by Medicare, such as limiting out-of-pocket expenses and covering all services covered by traditional Medicare.",
      "\"Medicare Advantage has definitely become a much more important part of the Medicare program. It's now the most popular coverage option within the program,\" Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at the right-leaning think tank Paragon Health Institute, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's grown very rapidly in popularity over the past decade,\" he continued. \"And that's going change the way that the government interacts with Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries.\"",
      "In an op-ed co-written for Forbes in June 2020, Oz said Medicare Advantage offers better care due to there being competing plans. He said Medicare Advantage could also be expanded to all Americans who are not on Medicaid, which would be funded by a 20% payroll tax. He has also promoted Medicare Advantage on his show, \"The Dr. Oz Show.\"",
      "Trump, too, has promoted Medicare Advantage, touting new benefits for seniors who were enrolled in the plan. What's more, Project 2025 -- a plan of conservative policy proposals proposed by the Heritage Foundation -- has proposed Medicare Advantage be the default option for Medicare coverage.",
      "\"I don't know what plans would be for such a proposal in Congress or in this administration,\" Albanese said. \"I can say that some of the proponents of a default Medicare Advantage enrollment approach say that [Medicare Advantage] plans are typically able to offer comparable, if not lower costs.\"",
      "However, critics argue making Medicare Advantage the default option could privatize the program\u00a0and limit people's options when it comes to receiving care because many doctors and hospitals don't accept Medicare Advantage.",
      "\"To move to a default option, I think it'd be hard to get that, particularly in an administration [that] is in favor of less regulation because Medicare Advantage requires a strong partnership with regulators,\" Daniel Polsky, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News. \"It's making a lot of requirements to ensure that the private insurance companies are using federal dollars wisely and acting in the best interests of the patients that they're responsible for.\"",
      "If Medicare Advantage became the default option, Polsky said, it would increase spending, and the program would not be able to negotiate with as many providers as traditional Medicare can.",
      "\"You have to take the good with the bad with Medicare Advantage if you're going to lean into that program,\" he said. \"There are just going to be beneficiaries that will not be served by that program because they need specialized care with specialized providers that they can't access in that program.\"",
      "Work requirements for Medicaid",
      "Little is known about what Oz's views are on Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. CMS\u00a0works with state programs to administer Medicaid, under which more than 72.4 million people are enrolled.",
      "Some Republicans have called to make cuts to Medicaid, which makes up 9% of the federal budget, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, proposed implementing block grants, which are lump sums of money the government provides to states to cover medical expenses. This differs from the current method, in which the government contributes dollars for every dollar spent by the states.",
      "Polsky said there would be negative consequences of moving to a block grants program.",
      "\"To move to a block grants program, any marginal spending by states would be felt at a much higher level,\" he said. \"Medicaid is a really critical counter-cyclical program, so when we're in a recession or moving toward a recession, spending goes up in the Medicaid program that acts as an important kind of macro balance that would somewhat go away because states have to balance their budgets.\"",
      "He added that flexibility for spending to go up or down based on the needs of the patient population in a certain state would also be much harder if a block grants program is implemented, which he said could have \"negative health consequences.\"",
      "Some Republicans may also encourage Oz and the Trump administration to implement work requirements as a basis of eligibility for Medicaid, including working or volunteering for a number of hours or being involved in educational activities.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, a Republican from Texas, told reporters last week that he supports a \"responsible and reasonable work requirement.\"",
      "Polsky said it would be a deterrent to people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid signing up, but it also doesn't incentivize work.",
      "\"My familiarity with the evidence -- turns out there weren't too many that were implemented, but there [have] been some work requirements of other programs in the past -- with work requirements is that they don't incentivize or ... actual work doesn't increase for people who enroll in these programs,\" he said.",
      "Polsky said he has found in his research that such requirements create more of an administrative burden due to the added documentation that comes with new requirements.",

      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz -- Trump's controversial pick to for attorney general, who would lead the department that would enforce any ban -- voted against a ban of the app while he was a member of the House -- though he signaled some support for the initiative.",
      "\"Banning TikTok is the right idea. But this legislation was overly broad, rushed and unavailable for amendment or revision. This is no way to run a railroad (or the internet),\" Gaetz wrote on X, formerly Twitter, at the time.",
      "TikTok and its parents company, ByteDance, have sued the U.S. government over the potential ban, ABC News previously reported, saying it's unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment, while pushing back on claims about the app being security risk.",
      "\"Congress itself has offered nothing to suggest that the TikTok platform poses the types of risks to data security or the spread of foreign propaganda that could conceivably justify the act,\" TikTok's lawsuit said.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, Trump could try to stop the ban through a number of methods, including pushing Congress to repeal the law banning the app, refusing to enforce the ban, or helping TikTok find a U.S. buyer to comply with the law and render the issue moot.",
      "The ban of the app was spearheaded in Congress by former Rep. Mike Gallagher, who said in an April interview with the New York Times that TikTok posed an \"espionage threat\" and a \"propaganda threat\" and that China is \"America's foremost adversary.\"",
      "Responding to allegations regarding TikTok, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Nig last year said that China \"has never and will not\" direct companies to illegally collect data in other countries, according to The New York Times.",

      "Gallagher resigned early this year and took a job with software company Palantir Technologies. A spokesperson for Gallagher rebuffed questions raised at the time over his swift move to Palantir, a company that was vocal about its opposition to TikTok, according to Forbes magazine.",

Hegseth told police the encounter was consensual.",

      "After Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick, the Florida congressman resigned from the House, meaning the House Ethics Committee no longer has the jurisdiction to continue its investigation into him -- however Republicans and Democrats had argued whether a break in that precedent was necessary for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent to presidential nominations.",
      "The Justice Department also spent years probing sexual misconduct allegations against Gaetz, as well as allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges. Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing related to the allegations investigated during the congressional and Justice Department probes.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, John Kennedy and John Cornyn met with Vance and Gaetz on Wednesday.",
      "The former congressman said the meetings have \"been going great.\"",
      "\"Senators have been giving me a lot of good advice. I'm looking forward to a hearing. Folks have been very supportive, and they've been saying we are going to get a fair process so it's a great day of momentum for the Trump-Vance administration,\" Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz said he hasn't spoken to Trump on Wednesday, \"But I had a great time with the vice president-elect talking about how we are going to end weaponization at the Department of Justice, we are going to tackle fentanyl, we are going to ensure that we don't have the DOJ involved in censorship anymore, and make sure that we have the country back on track and are there for President Trump's total fulfillment of his promise on his immigration agenda.\"",
      "Asked if he was confident he could be confirmed, Gaetz replied, \"It was a great day.\"",
      "When asked how messy Gaetz's confirmation hearing could become, Sen. Cornyn joked to reporters it could be \"Kavanaugh on steroids\" -- a reference to the now-U.S. Supreme Court justice's contentious confirmation hearings in 2018.",
      "\"He's a smart guy,\" Cornyn added. \"I'm sure he realizes that.\"",
      "Sen. Graham told reporters that the meeting went well and that Gaetz deserves a fair nomination process.",
      "\"Here's what I told him, no rubber stamps and no lynch mob. I'm not going to be part of a process that leaks information that shouldn't be leaked,\" Graham said. \"I'm not going to legitimize the process to destroy the man because people don't like his politics. He will be held to account in the confirmation process. He deserves a chance to make his argument why he should be attorney general.\"",
      "Hawley defended Gaetz's nomination.",
      "\"My intention is to vote for all the president's nominees,\" Hawley said. \"I think for my colleagues who are -- who have concerns about the Attorney General nominee, my message would be, well, let's have a hearing on this. You can ask whatever -- if you're a member of the committee, you can ask whatever question you want, give Gaetz the opportunity to answer questions, lay out his vision, answer concerns.\"",
      "Hawley said Gaetz understands his job, if confirmed, is to \"serve at the pleasure of the president.\"",
      "\"You gotta remember that cabinet secretary is not an exercise in individuality. I mean, you're there to serve at the pleasure of the president. That's the job, and he has a sense of what the president wants to do in terms of prioritizing law enforcement, getting the department out of the business of political prosecutions. So he wants a chance to lay that out,\" Hawley said.",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday to request the complete evidentiary file in the bureau's closed investigation into Gaetz. Included in the ask is a request for forms that memorialize interviews conducted as part of the investigation.",
      "The Democrats argued in the letter that there is precedent for the FBI providing these sorts of documents to Congress, including instances when Republicans obtained these documents.",
      "As Vance and Gaetz met with senators, Trump attempted to blame Democrats for the allegations launched against some of his controversial Cabinet picks.",
      "\"They dirty them up, they destroy them, and then they spit them out. They are trying that right now with some great American Patriots who are only trying to fix the mess that the Democrats have made of our Country,\" Trump posted on his social media platform Wednesday afternoon.",

      "The total number of women who are state lawmakers has once again reached new heights, following a trend up in recent years",
      "Women will for the first time make up a majority of state legislators in Colorado and New Mexico next year, but at least 13 states saw losses in female representation after the November election, according to a count released Thursday by the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.",
      "While women will fill a record number of state legislative seats in 2025, the overall uptick will be slight, filling just over third of legislative seats. Races in some states are still being called.",
      "\u201cWe certainly would like to see a faster rate of change and more significant increases in each election cycle to get us to a place where parity in state legislatures is less novel and more normal,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the CAWP, which is a unit of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.",
      "As of Wednesday, at least 2,450 women will serve in state legislatures, representing 33.2% of the seats nationwide. The previous record was set in 2024 with 2,431 women, according to the CAWP.",
      "The number of Republican women, at least 851, will break the previous record of 815 state lawmakers set in 2024.",
      "\u201cBut still, Republican women are very underrepresented compared to Democratic women,\u201d Debbie Walsh, director of the CAWP, said.",
      "By the most recent count, 19 states will have increased the number of women in their state legislatures, according to the CAWP. The most notable increases were in New Mexico and Colorado where women will for the first time make up a majority of lawmakers.",
      "In New Mexico, voters sent an 11 additional women to the chambers. Colorado had previously attained gender parity in 2023 and is set to tip over to a slight female majority in the upcoming year.",
      "The states follow Nevada, which was the first in the country to see a female majority in the legislature following elections in 2018. Next year, women will make up almost 62% of state lawmakers in Nevada, far exceeding parity.",
      "Women in California\u2019s Senate will make up the chamber\u2019s majority for the first time in 2025 as well. Women also made notable gains in South Dakota, increasing its total number by at least nine.",
      "At least thirteen states emerged from the election with fewer female lawmakers than before, with the most significant loss occurring in South Carolina.",
      "Earlier this year, the only three Republican women in the South Carolina Senate lost their primaries after they stopped a total abortion ban from passing. Next year, only two women, who are Democrats, will be in the 46-member Senate.",
      "No other state in the country will have fewer women in its upper chamber, according to the CAWP. Women make up 55% of the state\u2019s registered voters.",
      "Half the members in the GOP dominated state were elected in 2012 or before, so it will likely be the 2040s before any Republican woman elected in the future can rise to leadership or a committee chairmanship in the chamber, which doles out leadership positions based on seniority.",
      "A net loss of five women in the legislature means they will make up only about 13% of South Carolina's lawmakers, making the state the second lowest in the country for female representation. Only West Virginia has a smaller proportion of women in the legislature.",
      "West Virginia stands to lose one more women from its legislative ranks, furthering its representation problem in the legislature where women will make up just 11% of lawmakers.",
      "Many women, lawmakers and experts say that women's voices are needed in discussions on policy especially at a time when state government is at its most powerful in decades.",
      "Walsh, director of the CAWP, said the new changes expected from the Trump administration will turn even more policy and regulation to the states. The experiences and perspectives women offer will be increasingly needed, she said, especially on topics related to reproductive rights, healthcare, education and childcare.",
      "\u201cThe states may have to pick up where the federal government may, in fact, be walking away,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd so who serves in those institutions is more important now than ever.\u201d",

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "The ICC does not have a police force and relies on cooperation from its 124 member states to enforce arrest warrants.",

      "Briefing the council by video from Libya, Khan said he met victims earlier Tuesday from Tarhuna who told him of their suffering. He said he walked \u201cin the areas where their loved ones were tortured and killed.\u201d One Libyan told him that \u201cevery household in Tarhuna has a victim,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Wednesday, though the modest moves for indexes masked some thrashing underneath the surface. Target lost more than a fifth of its value after the retailer gave a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season.",
      "The S&P 500 finished the day virtually unchanged after coming back from a loss of 1% during the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 139 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%.",
      "Target\u2019s 21.4% tumble followed its report showing weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The retailer also gave a forecast for profit in the upcoming holiday season that was below analysts\u2019 estimates.",
      "Target\u2019s performance stood in stark contrast to rival Walmart, which reported another quarter of stellar sales Tuesday and released optimistic projections for the holiday season.",
      "Hints about how U.S. consumers are doing are under particular scrutiny, given that they\u2019ll need to keep spending if the U.S. economy is to continue growing and avoid a recession. Shoppers are contending with high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates.",
      "\u201cI find the Target and Walmart earnings very interesting because we typically see a waterfall type effect when the economy begins to struggle, with shoppers trading down from stores such as Target to Walmart,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure if the move to Walmart is simply a matter of shoppers finding more items they like at Walmart or if this is a potentially concerning economic sign.\u201d",
      "Besides Target, several lower-priced retailers were among the biggest losers in the S&P 500. Dollar General fell 4.2%, and Dollar Tree sank 2.6%.",
      "On the winning end of Wall Street was Williams-Sonoma, which jumped 27.5% after the home retailer delivered better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

      "The headliner of the day, week and perhaps the rest of the year for Wall Street arrived after trading ended for the day. That\u2019s when superstar stock Nvidia unveiled its results for the latest quarter.",
      "The company has grown into a nearly $3.6 trillion behemoth because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. It\u2019s grown so fast, with its stock nearly tripling for the year so far, that pressure has grown for it to show it can keep leapfrogging past analysts\u2019 already high expectations.",
      "On Wednesday, Nvidia's profit again topped analysts' estimates.",
      "Trading in the options market suggests Nvidia\u2019s profit report was the most anticipated event left in 2024, more than even the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting on interest rates, according to Barclays Capital.",

      "Wells Fargo Investment Institute on Wednesday raised its forecasts for where Treasury yields will end next year, in part because of expectations that Trump\u2019s policies will drive faster U.S. economic growth and inflation. Strategists at the institute also raised their forecast for where the S&P 500 will end next year because of that faster growth, which should translate into bigger corporate profits, along with easier regulations.",

      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani have asked a judge to penalize him even more",
      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani asked a judge Wednesday to penalize him even further for continuing to falsely accuse them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, argued in a filing in a Washington, D.C. federal court that Giuliani has \u201cbrazenly\u201d violated an agreement he signed to stop repeating the falsehoods, The alleged violations came in statements he made during two recent broadcasts of his nightly show on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cThese statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,\u201d read the filing, which asked the judge to hold Giuliani in contempt and impose sanctions against him.",
      "A lawyer for Giuliani, Joseph M. Cammarata, said he had not seen the court filing and could not respond to its specific claims, but accused the women's attorneys of trying to intimidate the former New York City mayor. In a statement, Giuliani's spokesperson, Ted Goodman, called the new legal filing an attempt to \u201cdeprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\u201d",
      "Giuliani, a longtime Donald Trump ally, was found liable last year for defaming Freeman and Moss by accusing them of ballot tampering as he pushed then-President Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani falsely claimed they sneaked in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines.",
      "The $148 million judgment led to a failed bankruptcy attempt by Giuliani. He has since been ordered to turn over many of his assets to Freeman and Moss, including his $5 million Upper East Side apartment.",
      "In December, the women sued Giuliani again for continuing to repeat his ballot-tampering claims, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction in May that barred the former mayor from making any statements that suggest the women engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Lawyers for the two plaintiffs argued in Wednesday's court filing that Giuliani broke that agreement when he referred to the pair again on his recent video broadcasts on Nov. 12 and Nov. 14, including baselessly claiming that he was not allowed to show tapes of \"quadruple counting\" ballots during the trial.",
      "In his statement responding to the filing, Goodman argued that Giuliani \u201chas every right to defend himself.\u201d",
      "Giuliani has been critical of a judge\u2019s ruling that ordered him to turn over many prized possessions to Freeman and Moss \u2014 including the apartment, a Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and dozens of luxury watches. He said he should not have had to surrender his possessions until his appeal is decided.",
      "At a news conference in New York City on Wednesday, Cammarata said Giuliani has turned over \u201c90 to 95%\u201d of his possessions. Last week Giuliani surrendered the Mercedes and watches. Cammarata said the 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500, Giuliani's only vehicle, should be appraised to determine whether it's worth less than $5,500, an amount he said would exempt the car from the judgment.",
      "As for the New York apartment, Cammarata said it either has been turned over or is in the process of being turned over.",
      "Giuliani has remained defiant amid the collection efforts, which have stretched past an Oct. 29 deadline.",
      "\u201cWe will not relent,\u201d Cammarata said.",

      "Philadelphia\u2019s mass transit system has reached a tentative contract deal with its largest workers union",
      "Philadelphia's mass transit system has reached a tentative contract deal with its largest workers union, averting a potential strike that could have seen thousands of employees walk off the job.",
      "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and Transport Workers Union Local 234 announced the one-year agreement Wednesday. It calls for union members to receive a 5% raise and an unspecified pension adjustment. The contract also has language aimed at improving the personal safety of frontline workers, including installing bulletproof enclosures for drivers since many face violence and harassment.",
      "Union President Brian Pollitt said a ratification vote would be held Dec. 6.",
      "The agreement comes about two weeks after union members had voted to authorize a strike once their one-year contract with SEPTA expired Nov. 8. Union leaders, though, agreed to delay a strike as long as they felt progress was being made at the bargaining table.",
      "Local 234 has about 5,000 members, including bus, subway and trolley operators, mechanics, cashiers, maintenance people and custodians.",
      "Late Wednesday afternoon, officials at SMART-TD Local 1594, which represents about 350 SEPTA workers in several suburban counties, also announced a tentative agreement they said includes a wage increase and \u201ccritical safety improvements.\u201d",
      "Pollitt said Wednesday that avoiding a strike was a priority, noting that public transit is a \u201cnecessary need\u201d for many residents, including students who take SEPTA trains and buses to school and workers who rely on the agency to get to their jobs.",
      "\"We got a fair deal, and now we need to focus on making sure SEPTA stays strong for everyone who depends on it,\" Pollitt said.",
      "Scott Sauer, SEPTA's interim general manager, said both sides worked hard to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis agreement is fair to our hardworking frontline employees and responsible to the customers and taxpayers,\u201d he said.",
      "SEPTA, which has repeatedly said its financial health is uncertain, recently proposed an across-the-board 21.5% fare increase that would start New Year\u2019s Day as well as severe service cuts that would take effect next summer. The agency has scheduled a Dec. 13 public hearing on the plan.",
      "If approved by SEPTA\u2019s board, riders would pay the increase on top of a proposed interim average fare increase of 7.5% the panel is due to consider later this month. If passed, it would take effect Dec. 1. If both increases take effect, the single fare cost of riding the city bus and subway would go from $2 to $2.90. SEPTA key fares, where riders get discounts for using a prepaid card to pay fares that now range from $3.75 to $6.50, depending on the zone they use, would range from $5 to $8.75 on Jan. 1.",
      "SEPTA last raised fares in 2017, and the proposed increase would be expected to bring in an additional $23 million for this fiscal year and $45 million per year starting in 2026.",
      "The nation\u2019s sixth-largest mass transit system, SEPTA faces an annual structural budget deficit of $240 million as federal pandemic aid phases out. It lost out on about $161 million in state aid since the Republican-controlled state Senate declined to vote on Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s proposal for $283 million in new state aid to public transit. Instead, lawmakers approved a one-time payment to the state trust fund for transit systems, of which SEPTA got $46 million.",

    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

      "MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The cross-examination of a man who says he was raped as a teenager by youth center workers in New Hampshire turned acrimonious Wednesday, with the accuser at one point calling an opposing lawyer a \"sick man\u201d following a heated exchange.",
      "It was the second day in the trial of Bradley Asbury, who is accused of holding down 14-year-old Michael Gilpatrick on a staircase in 1997 with help from a colleague, while a third staffer raped the teen and a fourth forced him to perform a sex act.",
      "It\u2019s the second criminal trial to stem from a broad 2019 investigation into historic abuse at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. Asbury, now 70, is among 11 men who worked there or at an associated facility in Concord who were arrested.",
      "Gilpatrick, now 41, took the stand for a second day and was questioned by defense lawyer David Rothstein, who pointed out inconsistencies in his recollection of the events leading up to the alleged attack, including how many times he\u2019d been released home in the months beforehand, what time of day the incident occurred, and whether there were other children around.",
      "Gilpatrick said his recollection of details before and after the attack were hazy.",
      "\u201cWhat I won\u2019t forget, do you want me to continue to tell you?\u201d Gilpatrick said during one of several fiery exchanges with the lawyer. \u201cThat your client held me down while another man raped me.\"",
      "\u201cGo ahead and say it again, in case they didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d the lawyer responded. \u201cSay it again.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe held me down and raped me,\u201d Gilpatrick said loudly, as he leaned into the microphone.",
      "\u201cSay it again,\u201d the lawyer responded.",
      "\u201cYou want me to keep saying it? You\u2019re a sick man,\u201d Gilpatrick said, before asking the judge for a break and storming off the stand.",
      "Rothstein said the attack never happened and Gilpatrick is motivated by money. He pointed out Gilpatrick has received more than $146,000 against an anticipated payout from a related civil case.",
      "\u201cYou're trying to establish that this is about money, and it's got nothing to do with money,\u201d Gilpatrick testified.",
      "Prosecutor Audriana Mekula said the rape occurred after Gilpatrick made a smart-aleck comment to Asbury and his colleagues and was then dropped onto the floor from behind, picked up by his arms and legs, and dragged onto a staircase at the juvenile lockup.",
      "Asbury had been fired from the Concord facility three years before over allegations of physical and psychological abuse. But he was later rehired and transferred to Manchester, where he worked until 2001.",
      "He is charged with two counts of being an accomplice to aggravated sexual assault. If found guilty, he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years on each count. The trial is expected to conclude either Thursday or Friday.",
      "An earlier case against Victor Malavet ended in a mistrial in September after jurors deadlocked on whether he raped a girl at the Concord facility. A new trial in that case has yet to be scheduled.",
      "The investigation has also led to extensive civil litigation. More than 1,100 former residents have filed lawsuits alleging physical, sexual or emotional abuse spanning six decades. In the only civil case to go to trial so far, a jury awarded David Meehan $38 million in May for abuse he says he suffered in the 1990s, though that verdict remains in dispute as the state seeks to reduce it to $475,000.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Meehan and Gilpatrick have done."

    "summary": "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

      "The leader of Canada\u2019s most populous province says all of the country\u2019s provincial and territorial premiers want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal government to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the United States that excludes Mexico",
      "TORONTO -- The leader of Canada's most populous province said Wednesday that all of the country's provincial and territorial governments want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal government to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the United States that excludes Mexico.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford chaired a phone call with all 13 provincial and territorial premiers and said they want Trudeau to do a straight bilateral trade deal with the U.S., Canada's top trading partner.",
      "The meeting and Ford's comments come as provincial and federal governments in Canada prepare for the uncertainty of another Donald Trump presidency.",
      "\"There\u2019s a clear consensus that everyone agrees that we need a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. and a separate bilateral trade deal with Mexico,\u201d Ford told reporters in Toronto after the call with provincial leaders.",
      "\u201cWe know Mexico\u2019s is bringing in cheap Chinese parts, slapping made in Mexico stickers on, and shipping it up through the U.S. and Canada, causing American jobs to be lost and Canadian jobs. We want fair trade,\" he said.",
      "Ford said they've asked for a meeting with Trudeau's government to discuss the issue.",
      "Asked about the issue at her morning press briefing. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Trudeau \u201cdoes not agree with that\u201d and that he wants to \u201cmaintain the treaty between the three countries and strengthen relations.\u201d",
      "She said that during the bilateral meeting they held during the G20 summit, Mexico proposed drafting a document with concrete data on how the treaty benefits each of the three countries because there is a misconception that it only benefits Mexico or Canada.",
      "But Trudeau's federal government did not rule out sidelining Mexico in future trade talks on Tuesday. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she shares U.S. concerns about Mexico serving as a back door for China to import cheaper goods into the North American market as a review of the trade pact known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement looms.",
      "Freeland said members of the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and supporters and advisers of President-elect Trump have expressed \u201cvery grave\u201d concerns to her about the issue and Canada shares them.",
      "Freeland chairs a special Cabinet committee on U.S-Canada relations that is designed to address concerns about another Trump presidency. Freeland has been meeting with provincial, business and labor leaders throughout Canada.",
      "Canada took a \u201cTeam Canada\u201d approach to the previous trade talks with Trump. It crossed all party lines.",
      "Trudeau called Trump after his election win and the two discussed the trade deal Trump reached during his first term with Canada and Mexico, the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.",
      "Ottawa will soon have to focus on a scheduled review of the agreement in 2026.",
      "During the recent U.S. election campaign, Trump proposed tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. Trump has not said whether his administration would exempt Canada.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, his move to renegotiate NAFTA and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada at the time.",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75% of Canada\u2019s exports, which include automobiles, go to the U.S.",
      "Ford said the leaders of provinces and territories will meet in Toronto in person in mid-December regarding their U.S. trade concerns. He also noted there is a U.S. governors meeting in February that he said they'd like to attend.",
      "Later Wednesday, Trump announced has chosen former Republican Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, who served as ambassador to the Netherlands during his first term, as his upcoming administration\u2019s ambassador to Canada.",
      "\u201cPete will help me once again put AMERICA FIRST,\u201d the president-elect said in a statement.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:34:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
    "story": [
      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "A judge has ruled that Virginia can\u2019t withdraw from a multistate initiative designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless the Legislature agrees to it",
      "Virginia can't withdraw from a multistate initiative designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless the Legislature agrees to it, a judge has ruled, dealing a blow to Gov. Glenn Youngkin's efforts to exit the compact.",
      "The ruling, issued Monday by retired Judge C. Randall Lowe in Floyd County, said Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board exceeded its authority when it voted last year to exit the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.",
      "The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is an effort by 12 mid-Atlantic and Northeast states to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon emissions. Participating states require plants of a certain generating capacity to purchase allowances to emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.",
      "Virginia joined the compact in 2020 when it had a Democratic governor as well as Democratic control of the Legislature. In 2021, Youngkin, a Republican, won election as governor but one or both legislative chambers have remained under Democratic control for the entirety of his term.",
      "Youngkin has said Virginia's participation in the cap-and-trade program amounts to a hidden tax on Virginians' energy bills.",
      "His spokesman, Christian Martinez, said Wednesday that the state will appeal the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cGovernor Youngkin remains committed to lowering the cost of living for Virginians by continuing to oppose the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which fails to effectively incentivize emission reductions in the Commonwealth,\u201d he said in a written statement.",
      "Shaun Kenney, a spokesman for Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, also expressed disappointment in the judge's ruling in a written statement, saying: \"We look forward to defending the commonsense repeal of this counterproductive program on appeal.\u201d",
      "The State Corporation Commission has estimated the typical monthly bill could increase by $2 to $2.50 for the years 2027 to 2030.",
      "Nate Benforado, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of a conservation group, said in a statement, \"The law requires RGGI and Virginians deserve RGGI. We hope that following the ruling, Virginia will get back into this statutorily-required program as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Last year, before the pollution board voted to end participation in the compact, Dominion Energy, the state's largest utility, estimated that it had incurred about $490 million in compliance costs from the initiative and recovered about $267 million from customers.",
      "Virginia formally exited the compact at the end of 2023.",
      "Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, a Democrat, praised the judge's ruling, calling it \u201ca win for all Virginians, their wallets, and our environment. Programs funded by RGGI have helped Virginians cut household energy costs, helped protect communities from floodwaters, and have been critical in the fight to cut pollution and address climate change.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Russia's third largest bank, Gazprombank and its six foreign subsidiaries were hit with U.S. sanctions on Thursday \u2014 in a move intended to curtail Russia's ability to evade the thousands of sanctions imposed on the nation since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and \u201cwill make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.\u201d",
      "In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions.",
      "The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war.",
      "In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. \u201cremains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u201d",

      "Gazprombank played a role in remaining Russian natural gas supplies to Europe by handling payments from foreign customers.",
      "Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis.",
      "European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe\u2019s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria\u2019s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere. The EU has set a nonbinding goal of ending all Russian gas imports by 2027.",

      "As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, his election victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear",
      "WASHINGTON -- As incoming White House chief of staff, one of Susie Wiles \u2019 vexing challenges will be policing the buffet line of powerful interests who want something from Donald Trump.",
      "It\u2019s a world she knows well. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, she lobbied for many of them.",
      "Trump was first elected on a pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But his transactional approach to the presidency instead ushered in a lobbying boom that showered allies, including Wiles, with lucrative contracts, empowered wealthy business associates and stymied his agenda after his administration was ensnared in a series of influence-peddling scandals.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to power, his victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear, raising the prospect that his second administration could face many of the same perils as his first. That will test the ability of Wiles to manage a growing number of high-powered figures \u2014 including Trump\u2019s children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and billionaires like Elon Musk \u2014 who will not be dependent on her for access to him.",
      "The appointment of a former lobbyist to such an important job \"bodes very poorly for what we are about to see from the next Trump administration,\u201d said Craig Holman, himself a registered lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cThis time around, Trump didn\u2019t even mention \u2018draining the swamp.\u2019 ... He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Brian Hughes, a spokesman from the Trump transition effort, rejected any suggestion that Wiles\u2019 past as a lobbyist would make her susceptible to pressure.",
      "\u201cSusie Wiles has an undeniable reputation of the highest integrity and steadfast commitment to service both inside and outside government,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cShe will bring this same integrity and commitment as she serves President Trump in the White House, and that is exactly why she was selected.\u201d",
      "Wiles\u2019 selection as chief of staff was Trump\u2019s first announced hire after his win. Wiles co-led the former president's campaign and was widely credited with having run an operation that was far more disciplined than his two previous efforts. Even so, she will have her work cut out for her. Though the job has traditionally entailed policing who has access to the president, Trump chafed at such efforts during his first presidency as he churned through four chiefs of staff.",
      "During his recent victory speech, Trump called Wiles an \u201cIce Maiden\u201d while praising her as a consummate behind-the-scenes player. She will be the first woman to hold the position.",
      "What is also clear is that Wiles, 67, has successfully managed headstrong men across a lengthy career in politics, government and lobbying. The daughter of NFL player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles worked for U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative icon, in the 1970s, followed by stints on Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign and as a scheduler in his White House.",
      "She later headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and is credited with helping businessman Rick Scott, now a U.S. senator, win the governor\u2019s office. After briefly managing Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, she oversaw Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House.",
      "Wiles was a partner at Ballard Partners, a regional firm that lobbied for Trump\u2019s companies in Florida. Shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Ballard set up shop in Washington and quickly became a dominant player, pulling in more than $70 million in lobbying fees during Trump\u2019s presidency, representing a who\u2019s who of corporate America, lobbying disclosures show.",
      "Many of Wiles\u2019 clients were plain vanilla entities with obvious aims \u2014 General Motors, a trade group for children\u2019s hospitals, homebuilders, and the City of Jacksonville.",
      "One in particular stood out that speaks to the ways, subtle or otherwise, that foreign interests seek to influence U.S. policy. In 2017, Wiles registered as a lobbyist for Globovisi\u00f3n, a Venezuelan TV network owned by Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a businessman charged in Miami with money laundering.",
      "Gorr\u00edn bought the broadcast company in 2013 and immediately softened its anti-government coverage. He hired Ballard to advise on \u201cgeneral government policies and regulations,\u201d lobbying disclosures show. But rather than working with the agencies that oversee telecommunications, Ballard\u2019s lobbying was trained on the White House, which would have little say in regulating a foreign broadcaster in the U.S. Globovisi\u00f3n paid Ballard $800,000 for a year of work.",
      "Brian Ballard, president of the firm, said that it\u2019s clear to him that Gorr\u00edn\u2019s aims weren\u2019t limited to the media business. Gorr\u00edn, who owns several luxury properties in Miami, had long positioned himself as a bridge between Venezuela\u2019s socialist government and U.S. officials.",
      "By the time Wiles and a team of Ballard lobbyists represented Globovisi\u00f3n, Gorr\u00edn was leading a quiet charm offensive for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government that sought closer ties with Trump at a time when the country was facing food shortages, violent crime and hyperinflation. It started before Trump took office when Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, kicked in a $500,000 donation for Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cHe was a fraud and as soon as we learned he was a fraud, we fired him,\u201d said Ballard. \u201cHe would ask us to set up a lot of things, in LA and D.C., and then nothing would happen. It was all a fantasy. He just wanted to use our firm.\u201d",
      "A few days after Ballard dropped Gorr\u00edn in 2018, federal prosecutors unsealed charges against the businessman for allegedly using the U.S. finance system to supply Venezuelan officials with private jets, a yacht and champion show-jumping horses as part of a fake loan scheme perpetrated by insiders to pilfer the state\u2019s coffers. Last month, he was charged a second time, also out of Miami, in another scheme to siphon $1 billion from the state oil company, PDVSA.",
      "Ballard said Wiles had almost no role in managing the relationship with Gorr\u00edn or several other clients for which she is listed as a lobbyist. But he praised her as someone who is a highly organized \u201cstraight shooter\u201d and \u201ctough as nails\u201d despite her soft demeanor.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the type of person who you want in a foxhole,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will serve the president well.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro engaged in a peacemaking offensive that included attempts to hire at least two other lobbyists. It fizzled out, however.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says he&rsquo;s running for governor in 2026",
    "story": [
      "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says he\u2019s running for governor in 2026",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, said Thursday that he's running for governor in 2026, becoming the first major candidate from either party to announce a bid.",
      "Prominent Republicans and Democrats are eyeing the seat, which will be open in two years after term-limited Republican Gov. Brian Kemp leaves the office. Other potential Republican contenders include Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, while the Democratic field is less well-defined.",
      "Carr is portraying himself as the best candidate to continue steady Republican leadership in the mold of the late U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, former Gov. Nathan Deal and Kemp.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen what it takes to be successful,\u201d Carr told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cAnd I want to run as the proven conservative who will create jobs for hardworking Georgians, keep our families and neighborhoods safe and vigorously defend our Constitution and freedoms.\"",
      "Carr has aligned closely with Kemp but could face opposition from President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters in a primary election. Jones has been close to Trump and would likely angle for his endorsement. By contrast, Trump endorsed primary opponents who ultimately lost to both Carr and Raffensperger in 2022, fueled by his displeasure that neither Carr nor Raffensperger backed Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss in Georgia.",
      "Carr said he was confident that he could win on issues and appeal to enough voters to win a Republican primary, despite his past differences with Trump.",
      "\u201cThis race isn't going to be about how loud somebody yells or screams, it\u2019s going to be about a conservative record,\" he said. \"And I\u2019m the one that has that.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s exceptionally early to announce a 2026 political bid. Customarily, statewide candidates in Georgia would announce sometime after 2025's legislative session. But Carr let it be known more than a year ago that he was lining up donors for a run. That's in part because Jones and Raffensperger are much more wealthy than Carr.",
      "Carr filed papers with the Georgia Ethics Commission Thursday creating a campaign committee to raise money for the governor's race. Announcing now could help Carr lock down donors, especially because he won't be able to raise money for his state campaign account during the three-month legislative session that convenes on Jan. 13.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Georgia traditionally has been preoccupied with defending civil lawsuits brought against the state and could only aid in a prosecution if a local district attorney requested help. But Republican lawmakers have given Carr increasing powers to directly prosecute criminals.",
      "In 2019, lawmakers gave Carr the authority to create a human trafficking prosecution unit. Carr\u2019s office says the unit has convicted 50 people, participated in 325 investigations and assisted more than 200 victims.",
      "In 2022, lawmakers directed Carr to create a statewide gang prosecution unit that now has offices in Atlanta, Albany, Augusta, Columbus, Macon and southeast Georgia. That unit has secured more than 40 convictions and indictments against more than 140 people.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s going to come here and locate a business or a job if they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d Carr said, calling his office\u2019s expansion of prosecutions \u201cvery successful.\u201d",
      "After working as a lawyer and the vice president of the conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation, Carr got his entry into politics when he joined U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson's staff in 2004 and became Isakson's chief of staff in 2007.",
      "Gov. Nathan Deal picked Carr to become Commissioner of Economic Development in 2013 after another old Isakson hand, Chris Cummiskey, left to work for the Southern Co., the Atlanta-based utility giant. Deal put a major emphasis on economic development as Georgia tried to dig out from the wreckage of the Great Recession, and Carr helped facilitate projects worth more than $14 billion in investment that helped create more than 83,000 jobs.",
      "Deal promoted Carr to attorney general in 2016 after Sam Olens resigned to become president of Kennesaw State University. Carr hadn't earned a living practicing law for years and had never personally tried a case. But he wasn't challenged in the Republican primary in 2018 and narrowly beat Democrat Charlie Bailey in the general election.",
      "In 2022, Carr demolished right-wing primary challenger John Gordon despite Gordon getting Trump's endorsement and then beat Democrat Jen Jordan in the narrowest victory of any Republican on the statewide ballot that year.",
      "Georgia's attorney general doesn't face term limits, meaning Carr could have chosen to run for reelection in 2026.",
      "Jones didn't say anything about his political plans Thursday, but underlined his link to Trump.",
      "\u201cGeorgians just endured a long election where the lieutenant governor was proud to fight alongside President Trump \u2014 now it's time to get to work,\u201d said Jones' chief of staff, Loree Anne Paradise. \u201cBurt is focused on delivering conservative solutions to the issues the General Assembly will tackle during the upcoming legislative session.\u201d",
      "Democratic candidates could include U.S. Rep Lucy McBath and outgoing DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.",
      "Republicans have won six straight governor\u2019s races in Georgia since Sonny Perdue became the first Republican to be elected in modern times in 2002. Democrats had hoped to break that streak under Stacey Abrams in 2022 after she narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018, but Kemp defeated her by a comfortable margin in their rematch."

      "ROME -- The U.S. special envoy for Sudan said Thursday, just days after his first visit to the war-wrecked country since taking his post, that he doesn't see enough of \u201cpolitical appetite\u201d from the warring parties to reach a resolution to the conflict.",
      "The African nation plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital of Khartoum and spread to other regions, including western Darfur.",
      "The fighting has left tens of thousands of dead, forced millions from their homes, and pushed a large swath of the population to starvation.",
      "Tom Perriello, who was appointed as special envoy in February, travelled to Port Sudan on Monday to meet with Sudanese officials, including the head of the military Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, whose troops have been battling the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces around the country for the past 19 months.",
      "Multiple attempts to broker a cease-fire have fallen apart, most recently in August, when the Sudanese military refused to attend U.S.-mediated talks in Geneva. Since then, fighting has only accelerated, and RSF forces have been accused by the United Nations of carrying out atrocities including killings of civilians and rapes in several parts of the country.",
      "\u201cWe do not yet see enough political appetite from the parties to find a real resolution to this conflict,\u201d Perriello said in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome. He said any solution \u201chas got to be about handing control back to the people.\u201d",
      "Sudan had been trying to establish a civilian government after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the RSF, joined forces to carry out a military takeover in 2021.",
      "But Burhan and Dagalo soon fell out, and their long-simmering struggle for control erupted into battles in Khartoum in April 2023 and spread the other parts of the country.",
      "Since then, more than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the U.N.. Some 14 million people \u2014 30% of the population \u2014 have been forcibly displaced, either to other parts of the country or abroad in what the U.N. says is one of the world's worst displacement crises.",
      "The U.N. recently warned that the country has been pushed to the brink of famine, and more than 26.5 million people face acute hunger.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are so large that you can\u2019t even get your head around the scale of human suffering,\u201d Perriello said. He decried the situation in which the warring parties continue to commit atrocities while civilians are trapped in the chaos.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is the numbers are astronomical,\u201d Perriello noting that, \u201cthe death toll is probably more than anything that\u2019s been estimated.\u201d",
      "He pointed to reported atrocities carried out by RSF fighters last month in the Gezira state, southeast of Khartoum. \u201cThese are horrific, horrific abuses against women and children, in this case, primarily committed by the Rapid Support Forces, and multiple attacks on civilians, murdering of civilians,\" he said.",
      "During his visit, Perriello met with members of Sudanese civil society and humanitarian aid workers in an effort to improve movement of food and medicines to people across the country.",
      "He said the United States is working to stop countries that are arming the warring parties despite a U.N. arms embargo.",
      "Sudan\u2019s ruling Sovereign Council, led by Burhan, accuses the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally, of arming the RSF \u2014 a charge that a U.N. panel of experts said was credible, though the UAE denies it. The RSF has also reportedly received support from Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t speak to specific conversations, but the United States has been very clear with countries all over the world that we believe it\u2019s time to stop fueling this war with more weapons,\u201d Perriello said.",
      "Burhan has received Russian support and is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan\u2019s foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.",
      "\u201cWe have way too many countries that are pouring weapons into Sudan who should be pouring in food and medicine,\" Perriello said. \"We have way too many countries deciding to get involved, not in the interests of the Sudanese people, but to take advantage of the fragility of the state.\u201d",
      "Perriello, who has worked on crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, said he had never been involved in a disaster on such a massive scale that is getting so little attention from the rest of the world."

      "In a preliminary decision, Ofwat said it would allow bill rises of 21% above inflation, which the shareholders did not accept.",
      "They walked away, effectively leaving the company under the control of its lenders.",
      "On Thursday, the environment secretary said it was \"disgraceful\" that half of water firms had given out \"unjustifiable and unmerited\" bonuses.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has given more detail about plans to allow dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "It is consulting on two options, either extending the deadline to the end of May or until December 2025.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "The two options are:",
      "Giving dealers until the end of May to deal with complaintsAllowing them until December 2025 to respond, to align the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints",

      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

      "\"I catch this train every single day,\" he said. \"It either doesn't turn up on time, or doesn't turn up full stop,\" he said. \"We've got dirty old rolling stock. It's a sham, it really is.\"",
      "Passenger Lisa Greenhalgh said she gets to the station 20 minutes early, and has then waited an hour and forty minutes for a train \"on a number of occasions in the freezing cold, and you've had no update, so you don't know what's happening, and by then it's too late to drive into Manchester, so you end up spending two hours out of the house and actually getting nowhere.\"",

      "Ahead of the protest, around 1,800 National Farmers' Union (NFU) members met near Parliament as part of a mass lobby of MPs.",
      "The group's president, Tom Bradshaw, gave an impassioned speech describing the tax changes as destructive, a \"stab in the back\" for farmers, wrong and unacceptable.",
      "He told protesters the changes were the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Later, speaking to Sky News, he said Labour had \"destroyed\" a \"contract\" between farming and the government dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"We'd love to pay more tax,\" Mr Bradshaw added.",
      "\"If we get proper margins from food production, and we end up swelling the Treasury coffers, bring it on.",

      "He added that Environment Secretary Steve Reed said when he was in opposition that Labour would not change agricultural property relief.",
      "Since 2019, pig farming costs have risen by 54%, cattle by 44% and cereal by 43%, as food, fuel and fertiliser prices increase at a rate far outstripping the increases farmers can charge on what they produce. Subsidies that farmers get have also been declining since Brexit.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "The number of the UK's 210,000 farms that could be affected by the inheritance tax change is also disputed.",
      "The government says it will affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) have estimated up to 70,000 farms worth more than \u00a31m could be affected.",

      "He is now considering gifting his estate, which he believes would fall outside of inheritance tax if he does not die within seven years, but feared he was not in a financial position to stop working.",
      "Others at the protest said they would have to sell their farms to pay the tax bills.",
      "Jen, a seventh-generation farmer from Yorkshire, who did not give her surname, told the PA news agency: \"If the Budget goes through, then that means I won't be able to take her over my family farm because between me and my brother, we would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",

      "If it hadn't been for the squirrels, George Matthew's attempt to become a cocoa bean producer might have failed.",
      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "To raise the quantity and quality of cocoa bean production, the government has introduced several initiatives.",
      "It is investing in schemes to develop hybrid cocoa plants, that are more productive than existing varieties.",
      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",

      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",

      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

      "Sadiq Khan told BBC London: \u201cAs long as I am mayor of this great city I will make sure we carry on with this fantastic policy.\u201d",

      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",

      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",

      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",

      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",

      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",

      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",

      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",

      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",

But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",

      "What the members of NewJeans are not, however, are workers, according to the government.",
      "The country's Ministry of Employment and Labor on Wednesday dismissed claims of workplace harrassment against a member of the group, saying celebrities were not seen as workers under the country's labour law - and were, therefore, not entitled to the same rights.",
      "The decision has drawn its fair share of scorn, with people saying they are not surprised given this is an industry known for its punishing schedules and intense competition.",
      "This is the latest scandal to hit NewJeans, which has for months been embroiled in a public feud with its record label, Ador.",
      "With slick pop songs like Super Shy, OMG and Supernatural, NewJeans were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this year's MTV Awards.",
      "Formed by label Ador in 2022, the group has five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - whose ages range from 16 to 20.",
      "The incident started after 20-year-old Hanni and the other four members of the band raised concerns about their treatment by Ador during an impromptu YouTube livestream on 11 September.",
      "In the band's YouTube video, which has since been deleted, they made claims of workplace harassment, among others, which culminated in Hanni saying she would testify in a hearing about bullying in the music industry.",
      "The Vietnamese-Australian singer, whose real name is Pham Ngoc Han, told lawmakers that she felt \"the company hated us\".",
      "She described how senior members of Hybe ignored her and her bandmates, and gave them cold shoulder. She also alleged that employees of the agency bad-mouthed NewJeans on internal communication app and asked a journalist to downplay the group's record sales in one article.",
      "Hybe had previously denied the accusations. The CEO of Ador, which is a subsidiary of Hybe, said at the hearing that she would \"listen more closely\" to her artists.",

      "But on Wednesday, South Korea's labour ministry rejected these claims, saying given the content and nature of the management contract signed by Hanni, she is not regarded as a worker under the country's Labour Standards Act.",
      "\"Individuals must meet the criteria under the Labour Standards Act... to be considered workers. This includes having fixed working hours and providing labour under the employer\u2019s direct supervision and control. Celebrities, including singers, are typically classified as independent contractors,\" Chunghwan Choi, senior partner of Yulchon law firm in Seoul explained.",

      "One expert has called the response \"utterly unfair and yet unsurprising\".",
      "The work for K-pop idols is \"emotionally and physically exhausting\", according to her, as they work \"incredibly long hours, often seven days a week for months in a row...[with] no clearly defined periods of rest\", says CedarBough Saeji, Assistant Professor of Korean and East Asian Studies at Pusan National University in South Korea.",
      "\"Exploitation of the workers is accepted because they are not regular employees and there is no labour union, or clearly we can now see, no governmental agency to advocate for humane working conditions for them,\" she argues.",
      "There are currently no specific laws in South Korea that provide protections for the working rights of celebrities or artists, says Mr Choi, saying that this \"underscores the urgent need for reforms to address longstanding issues in the entertainment industry\".",
      "One measure that could be put into place to safeguard the working rights of artists is something similar to the Talent Agency Act in Hollywood, which requires talent agencies to obtain licenses and prohibits unfair or exploitative contracts, adds Mr Choi.",
      "However, he adds that \"while there have been discussions about implementing laws similar to the Talent Agency Act, no such legislation has been enacted yet\".",
      "'Idols are Workers'",

    "story": [
      "The Sidemen are used to making content for YouTube, but say they've now \"hit the limit\" on what they can achieve on the video sharing platform so are moving \"to something even bigger\".",
      "The British YouTube superstars have announced that the second season of their reality show, Inside, will debut on Netflix next year. The streaming giant will also make a US version.",
      "The Sidemen - the seven-strong group that includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 146 million YouTube subscribers between them.",
      "Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was \"ambitious\" but it was \"exciting to conquer a new challenge\".",
      "He said: \"Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world.\"",
      "The Sidemen started creating YouTube content in the early 2010s.",
      "They started by playing and reacting to video games, but in the past decade the group of friends have branched out to comedy sketches, travel challenges, podcasts and a dating show.",
      "They now employ a production team of more than 100 people who help create the videos and generate ideas, Vik said.",
      "One idea that has \"massively taken off\" is Inside, which launched in June on YouTube and racked up 14 millions of views for its opening episode.",
      "The contest's first season saw 10 influencers locked in a house for a week as they battled for a prize with up to \u00a31m.",
      "Its success caught the attention of Netflix bosses, who have now commissioned a second UK season and a US version of the show. Both will be on Netflix instead of YouTube.",
      "'Connect with new audiences'",
      "\"YouTube opened so many doors for us so we can't diminish its power and it's still unrivalled in some ways,\" Vik explained. \"But working with Netflix is a cool opportunity for us to reach a new audience.",
      "\"We're at a ceiling with YouTube - we bring in 20 million UK viewers each month and now we're thinking about how to connect with different people.\"",
      "Aside from Vik and KSI, the other Sidemen are Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga and W2S.",
      "Vik said the group, who are aged between 27 and 32, had some reservations about bringing their work to a new platform because \"we've never done it before and we're all very particular about the way we work\".",
      "\"We also move at a really fast pace - sometimes we shoot on Wednesday and by Sunday we will have uploaded a two-hour video. So we wanted to make sure Netflix were happy with the fast turnarounds and us being very dynamic.\"",
      "But the seven members vote on everything and were unanimous in the decision to move their reality show to Netflix, he said.",
      "The group will serve as executive producers and have \"full control to make the new season bigger and better than the last\".",
      "They aren't the only online stars to take their own big-money game show to a conventional streaming platform instead of putting it on YouTube.",
      "MrBeast, the world's most popular YouTuber, will launch Beast Games on Amazon Prime Video on 19 December, although that show has been at the centre of controversy.",
      "As one of the UK's biggest YouTube content creators, 29-year-old Vik is very aware of how many young men look up to him. But he said it's not his job to be a role model.",
      "\"In our videos we're just ourselves, we're not aiming to be certain characters, and first and foremost we're content creators who make fun videos.\"",
      "He added that the Sidemen had a \"unified stance on not speaking about political and social issues\".",
      "\"Sometimes we feel pressure to, but we would rather leave this to the experts.\"",
      "Part of the reason for this decision is the intense media scrutiny they face.",
      "KSI recently faced backlash after he shared a video of Donald Trump drinking a bottle of Prime, an energy drink he co-founded.",
      "Some saw that as promoting and supporting Trump ahead of the US election. However, Vik responded by saying the group \"try not to over analyse things\".",
      "\"Everything we do will always upset a small group of people but you just have to move forward,\" he said.",
      "'People thought I was weird'",
      "The Sheffield-based creator also said the group had got better at \"ignoring the trolling and hate\".",
      "\"The internet has become a very turbulent place recently and occasionally things do get to us.",
      "\"We try and just think about how proud we are of everything we've built and that helps us cancel out the negativity.\"",
      "Vik said \"people thought I was weird\" when he first started making content a decade ago.",
      "\"At school people would think I was strange for videoing myself playing games and that there was something wrong with me when I was recording myself on my phone in public.",
      "\"And my parents were not happy at all with how much time I was spending on YouTube, but they said as long as I got good grades at school then I could carry on.\"",
      "The Sidemen have been working together for more than a decade, and in recent months there have been rumours that the group may disband soon.",
      "However, Vik quashed those rumours, saying: \"Right now everything is fantastic.",

    "summary": "The adaptation of Broadway show Wicked has a star-studded cast of Ariana Grande and Jeff Goldblum.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked.",
      "\"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says.",
      "Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches.",
      "The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.",
      "She says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\".",
      "\"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\"",
      "In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight.",
      "\"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other.",
      "\"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says.",
      "Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\".",
      "\"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.",
      "Mixed reviews",
      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",
      "She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior.",
      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",

    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",

    "summary": "Former health secretary tells inquiry some healthcare settings did run out - \"and it was awful\".",
    "story": [
      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",
      "The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems.",
      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed five tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, an Australian woman, a US man and two Danish nationals have died, while another Australian woman remains critically ill in hospital. The deaths remain under police investigation, but news reports and testimonies online from other tourists suggest they may have consumed drinks laced with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South-East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulations in the food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml of it can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South-East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It is a problem that often affects poorer countries - outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as a hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks by making products with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC. They also said methanol poisonings are reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",
      "The diplomat also said that the risks of bootleg alcohol are well known among tourism operators and embassies, but a high-profile campaign is needed to inform tourists.",
      "\"This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem,\u201d they added.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:44:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Angela Rayner sought inspiration from John Prescott's rise to the near top of the Labour Party and the country.",
    "story": [
      "John Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts.",
      "He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off.",
      "His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre.",
      "He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together.",
      "It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer.",
      "Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged.",
      "Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC:  \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\"",
      "She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\"",
      "Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\".",
      "She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Both left school with few qualifications and worked their way up through the union movement, before entering politics.",
      "And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use.",
      "Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them.",
      "And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for.",
      "The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner.",
      "Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life.",
      "For all the talk about how he was the authentic working class grit in the smooth, polished very middle class New Labour, that sense of his class \u2013 \u201cbottom class\u201d as he put it \u2013 and others was a huge part of how he saw himself, and how he saw others.",
      "If you have a moment today, I recommend listening to this wonderful documentary on BBC Sounds \u2013 Prescott At Your Service - which tells the story of a 19-year-old John Prescott working as a waiter on a cruise ship to New Zealand, where the future deputy prime minister would serve the recently resigned former prime minister Anthony Eden.",
      "Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government.",
      "\u201cHe could smell out condescension, a slight, an air of superiority or a snub at a thousand paces; and at once smelt, he could charge after it with quite shocking abandon.\u201d",
      "John Prescott was the conduit between Labour\u2019s past and its present.",
      "He was, as well, the glue binding Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose pivotal but at times dysfunctional relationship defined the first decade of Labour\u2019s stint in power between 1997 and 2010.",
      "And he illustrated a path to the near pinnacle of power for those whose backgrounds still rarely lead to the top table of British politics.",

      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",

      "Ian Corfield, a former banker who had donated \u00a320,000 to Labour, got a temporary Treasury role to help deliver an investment summit in October.",
      "Jess Sargeant, who had worked for think tank Labour Together, became the deputy director in the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Constitution Group.",
      "Between November 2023 and September 2024, Labour Together made a donation-in-kind to Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds.",
      "Emily Middleton was named a director general in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), where the secretary of state is Peter Kyle.",
      "She was previously a partner at consultancy firm Public Digital, which paid for her secondment to Kyle's office in opposition - a donation-in-kind of more than \u00a365,000. She was also seconded to Labour Together.",
      "In August, Conservative shadow minister John Glen called for \"full transparency\" adding: \"Keir Starmer can no longer try to brush this under the carpet.\"",
      "In the same month, the Civil Service Commission - which regulates civil service appointments - said it would be launching a review \"given interest in a number of recent civil service appointments by exception\".",
      "The commission is led by Gisela Stuart, once a Labour MP who has since been appointed as an independent peer to the House of Lords.",
      "Exceptions",
      "According to civil service rules, 'exception' appointments can be made in certain circumstances, for example if it is a temporary appointment, if the job requires \"highly specialist skills\", or to fill gaps in periods of short-term urgent need.",
      "The commission must approve exception appointments at the most senior grade, but below this level departments have a free hand to recruit.",
      "The commission's report found that in 2023/24, 6,977 exception appointments were made out of a total of 98,328 appointments.",
      "That represented a 25% fall on the previous year when 9,362 appointments were made by exception.",
      "Between July and August 2024, departments approved 550 appointments by exception.",
      "The report said this was \"considerably lower than might have been expected based on data from previous years\".",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the report was \"worth reading\".",
      "However, Henry Newman, a former adviser to Conservative ministers who now writes about Whitehall, said the review was \"always going to be something of a whitewash\".",
      "In a post on social media, he said it was \"irrelevant\" that appointment numbers were down and repeated his concerns that people linked to party donations had been given government jobs.",
      "The commission's report said there was \"no bar on individuals who have previously worked for political parties or made political donations becoming civil servants\".",
      "It added that departments were responsible for addressing \"any potential propriety matters\".",
      "Newman argued there still needed to be \"clarity\" about whether the civil service knew of certain donations before appointing Sargeant, Middleton and Corfield.",
      "When questioned in September, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said a donation from Corfield had been declared \"over a year ago\", adding: \"We answered all the questions in the right way that the civil service asked when we made that appointment.\"",
      "A Labour source said: \u201cThis report destroys the Tory Party\u2019s desperate smear campaign and exposes their rank hypocrisy after they made more than four times as many civil service appointments a month without competition.\u201d",
      "'Robust challenges'",
      "In its summary, the commission said it was \"largely satisfied with processes in place within departments to apply, consider and approve exception requests\".",
      "\"Occasionally, appointments were not fully justified according to the terms of the Commission\u2019s recruitment principles or appeared to lack justification for their length.",
      "\"Some departments appeared to lack central tracking systems.\"",
      "The review made a number of recommendations including advising all departments to produce exception approval forms explaining why it would not be appropriate to run a fair and open recruitment process.",
      "It also said there should be \"robust challenge processes\" in place to ensure the exceptions were \"strictly applied\"."

      "Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said the decision to restrict the \u00a3300 payment to all but the poorest pensioners this winter was made with a \"heavy heart\".",
      "But he insisted the \"difficult\" decision was required to repair the public finances.",
      "It comes after the government disclosed an official estimate that the move would push an extra 50,000 pensioners into poverty.",
      "It says this figure does not account for its ongoing drive to increase take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming the top-up.",
      "Winter fuel cut to put 50,000 into poverty next year",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "It was introduced in 1997 as a universal payment to reassure pensioners they would be able to heat their homes as temperatures drop, although in practice recipients can spend it on whatever they want.",
      "But from this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, meaning around 9 million pensioners will no longer get it.",
      "It did not feature in Labour's election manifesto and the move, announced three weeks after its return to power, caught many MPs by surprise.",
      "Ministers say means-testing the payment will save the Treasury \u00a31.4bn this year and is required to help fix a \"black hole\" in the Tories' spending plans for this year identified by a specially-commissioned spending audit in July.",
      "Scottish Labour has pledged to make the payment universal again if it forms the next Scottish government after elections in 2026.",

      "The figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000, with Kendall adding this meant \"small variations\" in the underlying numbers could \"lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".",
      "The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - around 15% - are currently in relative poverty, meaning their income is 60% less than the median average.",
      "It has estimated that around 880,000 pensioners who qualify for pension credit at the moment are not claiming it, and would therefore be eligible to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they did.",
      "The government has estimated that means-testing winter fuel payments will save \u00a31.4bn this year, based on around 100,000 pensioners out of those 880,000 coming forward to claim pension credit.",
      "The Treasury has said the scale of the take-up is the main uncertainty when it comes to working out how much the measure will save.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Kyle said the government had been \"forced to take\" the decision \"because of the inheritance that we had from the previous administration\".",

      "The prime minister said he understood farmers' concerns and \"wants to support\" them but added \"the vast majority\" would be unaffected.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",

      "The farming tax row explained",
      "Watch: BBC Verify explains the inheritance tax row",
      "How many farms would be affected by Budget changes?",
      "However, many farmers argue that while they are asset rich - for example in terms of their land and livestock - they are cash poor and the changes would mean they would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "Ahead of the protest, around 1,800 National Farmers' Union (NFU) members met near Parliament as part of a mass lobby of MPs.",
      "The group's president, Tom Bradshaw, gave an impassioned speech describing the tax changes as destructive, a \"stab in the back\" for farmers, wrong and unacceptable.",
      "He told protesters the changes were the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Later, speaking to Sky News, he said Labour had \"destroyed\" a \"contract\" between farming and the government dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"We'd love to pay more tax,\" Mr Bradshaw added.",
      "\"If we get proper margins from food production, and we end up swelling the Treasury coffers, bring it on.",
      "\"But at the moment the supply chain doesn't give us those returns that enables us to save the money to pay the inheritance tax that this government now wants to take.\"",
      "He added that Environment Secretary Steve Reed said when he was in opposition that Labour would not change agricultural property relief.",
      "Since 2019, pig farming costs have risen by 54%, cattle by 44% and cereal by 43%, as food, fuel and fertiliser prices increase at a rate far outstripping the increases farmers can charge on what they produce. Subsidies that farmers get have also been declining since Brexit.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "The number of the UK's 210,000 farms that could be affected by the inheritance tax change is also disputed.",
      "The government says it will affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) have estimated up to 70,000 farms worth more than \u00a31m could be affected.",
      "Between 2021 and 2022, 117 farms with a value of more than \u00a32.5m were inherited.",
      "Reed told the Commons Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday that many farmers protesting over the tax changes were \"wrong\" about the policy - and he rejected claims the government had underestimated how many people would be affected.",
      "\"Many of them, probably happily, are wrong because there are things that they can do to plan their tax affairs as most businesses or asset owners would do to limit their liability,\" he said.",
      "He said: \"The numbers I've heard bandied around are enormous and very, very frightening if people were to believe them.\"",
      "He acknowledged the changes would be \"unsettling\" and said he was \"listening\" to concerns, but insisted that most farmers would not face a hike.",
      "Among those attending Tuesday's events was Gloucestershire livestock farmer David Barton, who estimates his business - which has been in the family since 1913 - is worth around \u00a35m in assets, but says it doesn't make much money year-on-year.",
      "Mr Barton is worried the proposed changes to inheritance tax could see his son facing a \u00a3800,000 bill and said the Budget \"has just ripped the heart out of us\".",
      "He is now considering gifting his estate, which he believes would fall outside of inheritance tax if he does not die within seven years, but feared he was not in a financial position to stop working.",
      "Others at the protest said they would have to sell their farms to pay the tax bills.",
      "Jen, a seventh-generation farmer from Yorkshire, who did not give her surname, told the PA news agency: \"If the Budget goes through, then that means I won't be able to take her over my family farm because between me and my brother, we would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "\"It's something we've both been passionate about from when we were little kids, ever since we could walk, always been involved - it's a lifestyle.\"",
      "The 24-year-old said they would have to pay approximately \u00a31.2m.",
      "\"We have spoken to our accountant, solicitors, and once something happens to our parents - unless there is some change, unless there's something we can do - then it's not possible for us,\" she said.",
      "Jeremy Clarkson, who owns Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire - which features in the Amazon series Clarkson's Farm - said he thought the change to inheritance tax was \"a very rushed last-minute decision\".",
      "\"I think we all make mistakes in life, and I think it's time for them to say 'you know what, we've cocked this one up a bit' and back down.\"",
      "BBC Newsnight\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire asked Mr Clarkson at the protest about his motivation for attending the rally: \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s not about your farm and the fact you bought a farm to avoid inheritance tax?\u201d",
      "Criticising the question as \u201cClassic BBC\", Mr Clarkson said: \"I wanted to shoot... which comes with the benefit of not having to pay inheritance tax. Now I do. But people like me will simply put it [money] in a trust.",
      "\"And so long as I live for seven years, that's fine... But it's incredibly time consuming to have to do that. And why should all these people have to do that? Why should they?\u201d",
      "Inheritance tax rules mean the amount people are liable to pay may vary.",
      "Under the new rules farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value)There is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325mIf a farmer is married, their spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65mIn addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m",

      "Sir Keir Starmer - who highlighted his childhood growing up in the countryside - said he \"gets\" farmers' concerns and said the government was using the Budget to invest in other areas which affect rural communities, such as hospitals, schools and housing.",
      "He said: \"I think it's very important for me to keep making the case that it's only farms and assets over \u00a33m in a typical case of parents wanting to pass on to their children, and therefore, for that reason, I'm confident that the vast majority of farms will not be affected.\"",
      "He said \u00a35bn had been pledged over two years \"in farming and food sustainability. That's hugely important for farmers, an additional amount for flooding that impacts them and on disease outbreak\".",
      "When asked if the government would reconsider the policy, the prime minister's official spokesperson replied: \"No - we have set out the reasons we have taken this difficult decision and why we believe it's a fair and proportional approach.\"",
      "Shortly before the rally ended, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch took to the stage to loud cheers as she pledged to reverse what she called \u201cthe family farms tax\u201d, which she said would \"destroy farming as we know it\u201d.",
      "The Liberal Democrats said it was \"utter rubbish\" to say only 500 of the UK's wealthiest farmers' estates would be affected each year.",
      "The party's environment spokesman, Tim Farron, told the BBC: \"The only way that people can pay the inheritance is get rid of the farm - so corporates buy it.",

      "US President-elect Donald Trump will visit Scotland next year for the opening of a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, his son has confirmed.",
      "Eric Trump and his father broke ground on the 18-hole links MacLeod Course at the Trump International resort in Menie last year.",
      "The course is expected to open next summer. If the visit goes ahead, it could be the first time Donald Trump travels to Scotland since his victory in the US election.",
      "His last visit as president in 2018 sparked a security operation with thousands protesting in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.",
      "Thousands protest as Trump plays golf",
      "Trump says 'great to be home' on visit to Scotland",
      "Trump International claimed the new course - named after Trump's Lewis-born mother, Mary - would feature the \u201clargest sand dunes in Scotland\u201d and form \u201cthe greatest 36 holes in golf\u201d alongside the original course, completed in 2012.",
      "The resort has prompted controversy in the past - four years ago the dunes at Menie lost their status as a nationally-important protected environment.",
      "But Trump International claimed the new course was \u201cone of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable\u201d ever built.",
      "The Scottish Greens previously said Trump and his new golf course were \"not welcome in Aberdeenshire\", accusing him of being a climate-change denier with a \"long history of lies and dodgy business dealings\".",

      "A paraglider was also able to fly over the resort hotel with a banner criticising Trump.",
      "Speaking to the PA news agency, Eric Trump said his family's \"love\" for Scotland kept them investing in the country.",
      "He said the Scottish government had made it \"virtually impossible\" to do business, saying \"[it's] very long to get permits, there are a lot of regulations, a lot of red tape, insane taxation, government leaders who just take pot shots at you for no reason whatsoever\".",
      "The businessman, Donald Trump's third child, said he had meticulously designed the refurbishment of the resort, including investing hundreds of millions of dollars into it, adding: \"And I've never really gotten so much as a thank you.\"",

      "Yet he was an important figure in the campaign to sell modernisation to the party and pave the way for Labour to regain power after 18 years in opposition with Tony Blair's historic landslide victory in 1997.",
      "Towards the end of his political career, a series of embarrassments - including an affair and allegations of ministerial impropriety - threatened to tarnish his salt-of-the-earth image.",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Ship's steward",
      "John Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family.",
      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",
      "In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree.",
      "Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.",
      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",
      "So what makes Labour think it will fare differently, and that its police-first strategy will work?",
      "The Today Podcast",
      "Special report: Europe\u2019s frontline against illegal migration",
      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",
      "Britain is one of the destinations he has in mind, along with the Netherlands and Germany.",
      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "title": "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:02:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget. Farmers have travelled to London and are taking part in a rally near Parliament to highlight their concerns.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "There have been different claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "These vary from as many as 70,000 to as few as 500.",
      "Where does the 70,000 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Country Land and Business Association whose president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "It was also used by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change.",
      "It is not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it is an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at the University of Reading, pointed to various sources, including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "Another way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Where does the 500 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Treasury, which says it expects 500 estates to be affected by the changes each year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value). The normal rate of inheritance tax is 40%.",
      "However, as Dan Neidle - founder of the independent Tax Policy Associates - points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is a \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it is  being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "He also wrote: \"It\u2019s become the most effective way for the super-rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax.\"",
      "Analysis by the property consultants Strutt & Parker found that 40% of farms that were sold last year in England were bought by investors while 45% were bought by working farmers.",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "Who pays inheritance tax?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "The Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are too low to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300, although that may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "Other government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (the amount of value farmers can extract from things like farmland and machinery by growing crops for example) is only about 0.5%, which is low compared with other businesses.",
      "The government points out that people inheriting farmland would have 10 years to pay the inheritance tax bill interest-free, unlike other inheritance tax, which needs to be paid immediately.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:34:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

    "story": [
      "With her signature shawl draped over her shoulders and silver hair pulled back from her face, Jane Goodall exudes serenity - even over our slightly blurry video call.",
      "In a Vienna hotel room, a press team and a small group of filmmakers, who are documenting her latest speaking tour, fuss around her.",
      "The famous primatologist and conservationist settles into a high-backed chair that dwarfs her slender frame.",
      "On my screen I can see that behind her, on a shelf, is her toy monkey, Mr H.",
      "The toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend and has travelled the world with her. Dr Goodall is now 90 years of age, and she and Mr H are still travelling.",
      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

      "It describes itself as \"social media as it should be\" - a place where people can come together over shared interests \"and have some fun again\".",
      "Many new users have said their decision to join Bluesky was driven by Elon Musk, who heavily backed Donald Trump's election campaign and intends to remain involved in the new administration.",

      "A robotic dog named \u201cSpot\u201d made by Boston Dynamics is the latest tool in the arsenal of the US Secret Service.",
      "The device has lately been spotted patrolling the perimeter of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "They do not have weapons - and each can be controlled remotely or automatically - as long as its route is pre-programmed.",
      "Passers-by are warned by a sign on each of Spot\u2019s legs: \u201cDO NOT PET.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know that anyone is tempted to pet these robot dogs. They do not look cuddly,\u201d said Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College.",
      "Video of Spot strutting around the property has gone viral on TikTok - where reactions range from calling them cool and cute, to creepy - and become fodder for jokes on American late night television. But its mission is no laughing matter.",
      "\u201cSafeguarding the president-elect is a top priority,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, US Secret Service chief of communications, in a statement to the BBC.",
      "In the months leading up to the US presidential election, Trump was the target of two apparent assassination attempts. The first took place at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania and the other occurred at the Mar-a-Lago golf course in September.",
      "Citing \u201cconcern for operational security,\u201d the Secret Service declined to answer the BBC\u2019s specific questions about the use of robotic dogs in Trump\u2019s security detail, including when the agency began deploying the device at his primary residence.",
      "Boston Dynamics also declined to answer specific questions, although it confirmed the Secret Service was deploying its Spot robot.",
      "So why might the Secret Service be using them now?",
      "Ron Williams, a former Secret Service agent who is now CEO of the security and risk management firm Talon Companies, suspects the assassination attempts against Trump added urgency to the agency\u2019s push \u201cto upgrade the technology that can enhance the ability to detect and deter,\u201d Williams said.",
      "At Mar-a-Lago, where so much of the property is exposed, Williams said robotic dogs are long overdue. \u201cThey can cover a lot more area\u201d than humans alone, Williams said of the dogs, which he expects will become more of a common sight over time.",
      "And it\u2019s not just the Secret Service. Williams said robotic dogs have increasingly become a tool used by militaries and law enforcement agencies around the world.",
      "New York City police scrap 'creepy' robotic dogs",
      "A bomb squad in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that purchased Spot in the spring deploys the device to inspect potential explosives, according to Boston Dynamics promotional materials.",
      "Last year, the New York Police Department moved forward with adding the robotic canines to its force despite complaints of \u201ca dystopian overreach of police power,\u201d according to Wired.",
      "On the other side of the globe, Ukraine has used them to conduct reconnaissance in the ongoing conflict sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, the Kyiv Post reports.",
      "See Spot run",
      "Spot is known for its agility. It can walk up and down stairs and navigate tight spaces. It can even open doors.",
      "But its ability to reveal potential threats ranks high among the reasons that so many agencies appear willing to pay up to $75,000 (\u00a359,000) for the device.",
      "Secret Service communications chief Guglielmi said the robotic dogs were \u201cequipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations\u201d.",
      "The device comes outfitted with multiple cameras that generate a 3D map of its surroundings, according to Boston Dynamics marketing materials, and can also have extras such as thermal sensing.",
      "But none of this happens without a human master.",
      "\u201cThey basically have a joystick controlling the robot dog as it walks around,\u201d said Missy Cummings, an engineering professor at George Mason University who runs the university\u2019s Autonomy and Robotics Center. Spot can also move automatically along predefined routes.",
      "Unlike their human and real canine counterparts, robotic dogs aren\u2019t distracted by visuals, sounds or smells they encounter.",
      "But despite their many impressive features, the devices can be taken down.",
      "\u201cYou just have to spray it with Aqua Net hairspray in its \u2018face\u2019,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd that would be enough to stop the cameras from working correctly.\u201d",
      "While the robotic dog seen at Mar-a-Lago is not armed, she says competitors appear to be experimenting with models that are.",
      "\u201cPeople are trying to weaponise these dogs,\u201d Cummings adds, citing a Chinese model with an attached rifle which she learned about at a robotics meeting this week.",
      "They aren\u2019t about to replace humans, says Melissa Michelson, who likens the devices to assisted-driving technology in some vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of faith in the ability of cars to drive by themselves,\u201d Michelson said.",
      "Secret Service agents at Mar-a-Lago have been seen patrolling alongside Spot.",
      "\u201cWe still do need those humans behind the scenes to use human judgment and be able to jump in if there\u2019s a technology breakdown,\u201d she says."

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",

      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",

      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",

      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",

      "In May, the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan sought warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, Deif and two other Hamas leaders who have since been killed, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar.",
      "Although Israel believes Deif is dead, the chamber said it had been notified by the ICC prosecution that it was not in a position to determine whether he was killed or remained alive.",
      "The prosecutor's case against them stems from the events of 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.",
      "Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign to eliminate Hamas, during which at least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "For Deif, the chamber found reasonable grounds to believe he was \"responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence\".",

      "It also found reasonable grounds to believe that \"each bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population\".",

      "By contrast it has been welcomed by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and ordinary citizens in Gaza.",
      "Leading Israeli figures across the political spectrum have reacted angrily to the announcement.",
      "President Isaac Herzog called it \"a dark day for justice and humanity\", saying the decision had \"chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom\".",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office called it \"an antisemitic decision\" and said that Israel \"utterly rejects the false and absurd charges\", labelling the ICC \"a biased and discriminatory political body\".",

      "In a statement it said: \"We call on all countries around the world to cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against defenceless civilians in the Gaza Strip\".",
      "Ordinary Palestinians in Gaza have also welcomed the announcement. Muhammad Ali, a 40-year old man displaced from Gaza City and currently in the central area of Deir al-Balah, said:",
      "\"We have been terrorised, starved, had our homes destroyed, and lost our children, sons, and loved ones. We welcome this decision, and of course, we hope that the decisions of the ICC will be implemented\".",

      "A total of 124 countries are signatories to the ICC, including the UK, but not the US, Russia, China, nor Israel itself.",
      "So this means that technically, if either Netanyahu or Gallant sets foot in any of the signatory countries they must be arrested and handed over to the court.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:36:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The deaths of five tourists after apparently drinking tainted drinks highlight the wider issue of fake or bootleg alcohol.",
    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed five tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, an Australian woman, a US man and two Danish nationals have died, while another Australian woman remains critically ill in hospital. The deaths remain under police investigation, but news reports and testimonies online from other tourists suggest they may have consumed drinks laced with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South-East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulations in the food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml of it can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South-East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It is a problem that often affects poorer countries - outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as a hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks by making products with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC. They also said methanol poisonings are reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",
      "The diplomat also said that the risks of bootleg alcohol are well known among tourism operators and embassies, but a high-profile campaign is needed to inform tourists.",
      "\"This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem,\u201d they added.",
      "Several Western governments updated their advice about alcohol dangers in South-East Asia on their consulate and travel pages this week.",
      "Some campaigners have sought to raise attention to the dangers before. Australian man Colin Ahearn runs a Facebook page called 'Don't Drink Spirits in Bali' where he warns against mixed drinks like cocktails or drinks made from opened bottles of spirits.",
      "He told Australian media earlier this week that his page used to receive a submission a week about methanol poisoning across South East Asia.",
      "Addressing this, the western diplomat told the BBC that it would be hard for people to protect themselves unless they went completely teetotal on holiday, as it is unrealistic for tourists to check the original source of all their alcoholic drinks.",

    "story": [
      "Texas authorities say they are prepared to offer President-elect Donald Trump 1,400-acres (567 hectares) of land along the US-Mexico border to build detention facilities for undocumented migrants.",
      "In a letter, the Texas General Land Office said the plot could be used to build facilities for \"processing, detention, and co-ordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history\".",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged to deport millions of undocumented migrants and mobilise the National Guard to help carry this out.",
      "His plan, however, is likely to face enormous financial and logistics hurdles, as well as immediate legal challenges from rights groups.",
      "The letter, published online and sent to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, notes that the owner of the recently purchased land had refused to allow a border wall to be built there and \"actively blocked law enforcement\" from accessing it.",
      "\"Now it's essentially farmland, so it's flat, it's easy to build on. We can very easily put a detention centre on there,\" Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said in an interview with Fox News, which first reported the offer.",

      "Buckingham said she was \"100% on board with the Trump administration's pledge to get these criminals out of our country\".",
      "But the Democratic governors of three other southern border states - California, Arizona, and New Mexico - have said they will not aid mass deportations.",
      "\u201cLocal and state officials on the frontlines of the Harris-Biden border invasion have been suffering for four years and are eager for President Trump to return to the Oval Office,\" Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "\"President Trump will marshal every lever of power to secure the border, protect their communities, and launch the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrant criminals in history.\u201d",
      "What any new detention facilities would look like is unclear, although the incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan has suggested they could be \"soft-sided\".",
      "Facilities currently in use range from soft-sided, camp-like facilities used by Customs and Border Patrol to house undocumented migrants for short periods of time, as well as brick-and-mortar buildings used by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "County and state jails are also used, for which local jurisdictions receive compensation from immigration authorities.",
      "Stephen Miller, the top Trump adviser on immigration who has been picked as deputy chief of staff for policy, has previously said the Trump administration would build vast holding facilities to serve as staging centres for mass deportations.",
      "In a late 2023 interview with the New York Times, Miller said that the facilities would likely be built on open land near Texas' border with Mexico.",
      "A 2024 spending bill signed by President Joe Biden allocated $3.4m (\u00a32.69m) for ICE to house as many as 41,500 on any given day.",
      "\"If Trump conducts mass deportations, ICE would blow past that number very quickly,\" Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America told the BBC.",

      "On Tuesday, for example, Los Angeles' city council passed a \"sanctuary city\" ordinance to bar using local resources to help federal immigration authorities.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said that the fact that Republican-led states are more likely to co-operate with the Trump administration's immigration goals could create a \"patchwork of protections\" that differ widely across the country.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 04:04:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has just tabled laws to block access to under-16s - but the proposal is divisive.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cI felt really scared to be honest,\u201d says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school.",
      "The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers.",
      "Almost instantly, his phone \u201cstarted blowing up\u201d with a string of violent messages.",
      "\u201cOne of them sounded like he was probably 17,\u201d James tells the BBC. \u201cHe sent me videos of him with a machete\u2026 he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.\u201d",
      "James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account.",
      "His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government\u2019s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym.",
      "The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as \u201cworld-leading\u201d.",
      "But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be.",
      "What is Australia proposing?",
      "Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the \u201charms\u201d of social media.",
      "\"This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,\" he said on Thursday.",
      "The new legislation provides a \"framework\" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail.",
      "Instead, it will be up to the nation\u2019s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed.",
      "According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.",
      "Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; \u00a325.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create \u201clow-risk services\" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set.",
      "Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn\u2019t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape.",
      "A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as \u201ca 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges\u201d.",
      "Such legislation could push kids into \u201cdangerous, unregulated parts of the internet\u201d, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts.",
      "eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given \u201ctechnology change is always going to outpace policy\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live.",
      "But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government\u2019s policy, which is that there\u2019s a causal link between social media and declining mental health.",
      "\u201cI would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,\u201d she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, \u201cfeel more themselves online than they do in the real world\u201d.",
      "This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. \u201cThis [ban] destroys\u2026 my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,\u201d the Perth teenager tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t fence the ocean\u2026 but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\u201d she told parliament earlier this year.",
      "But parents like Emma see it differently.",
      "\u201cShould we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?\" she says.",
      "\u201cOr should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?\u201d",
      "Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven\u2019t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren\u2019t ready for it.\u201d",
      "'Too blunt an instrument'",
      "Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as \"too blunt an instrument\" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have \u201csafe access\u201d to digital environments.",
      "It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that\u2019s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations.",
      "To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce \"digital duty of care\" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety.",
      "Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban \u201ccould be part of a strategy, it absolutely can\u2019t be the whole strategy\u201d.",
      "She says \u201cthe biggest piece of the puzzle\u201d should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media.",
      "The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free \u201cdigital literacy tools\u201d to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren\u2019t receiving regular lessons.",
      "Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the \u201cenormous risks\u201d associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online.",
      "The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested.",
      "In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user\u2019s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to \u201cpreserve\u201d their privacy.",
      "However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,\u201d she tells the BBC.",
      "Will Australia succeed?",
      "Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.",
      "In 2011, South Korea passed its \u201cshutdown law\u201d which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to \u201crespect the rights of youths\u201d.",
      "More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.",
      "A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia\u2019s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.",
      "Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review.",
      "\"We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But for parents like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most.",
      "\u201cFor too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,\u201d Ms Friedlander says.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.\u201d",
      "James says that since quitting Snapchat he\u2019s found himself spending more time outside with friends.",
      "And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to \u201cget out and do the things they love\u201d instead of feeling pressured to be online."

      "Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is \u201cnot over\u201d despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says.",
      "The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation.",
      "The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week.",
      "However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough.",
      "Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (\u00a325.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy.",
      "Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought \"no sense of relief\" for him.",
      "\"I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,\" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities.",
      "The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks.",
      "Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector.",

      "Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill \"a dog's breakfast\" and vowed to introduce \"deeper cuts\" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May.",
      "The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill \"dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause\".",
      "The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked \"tough\" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years.",
      "The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place.",
      "The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia\u2019s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed.",
      "But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure.",
      "\"The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,\" Mr Sheehy said.",

      "Tensions at the French mass rape trial burst into the open on Wednesday when Dominique Pelicot\u2019s daughter Caroline shouted at her father from across the courtroom that he would \u201cdie alone like a dog\u201d.",
      "Caroline Darian, 45, has repeatedly said she is convinced her father drugged and abused her after semi-naked photos of her asleep were found on his laptop.",
      "He has denied abusing her but has admitted drugging his wife Gis\u00e8le for a decade and recruiting men online to rape her in their home when she was unconscious.",
      "Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men have been on trial since September, and a verdict is expected on 20 December.",
      "During an emotional day in court in Avignon, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's lawyers gave their closing arguments, describing the historic nature of the trial and paying tribute to her courage in waiving her anonymity to bring the mass rape trial into the open.",
      "In her statements to the court Caroline spoke of her anguish at what she says are persistent lies by her father.",
      "Earlier this week, with a voice full of emotion, she told the court her life had \u201cstopped\u201d when police first showed her photos from her father's laptop in 2020.",
      "On Wednesday, Dominique Pelicot was given a chance to address his daughter while taking the stand for the final time in this trial.",
      "The main defendant said he most wished he still had Caroline's support.",
      "\u201cSome may laugh but it\u2019s my daughter I wish I could look at in the face. It hurts to see her like this,\u201d he said, sitting in a glass box only metres away from his daughter and the rest of his family.",
      "\u201cI would love to see her, I would love to talk to her,\u201d he added. As his voice faltered, Caroline\u2019s rose: \u201cI will never come see you. Never. You will die alone like a dog,\u201d she shouted.",
      "\u201cWe all die alone,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou especially,\u201d she hit back.",
      "It was the last public exchange between a father and daughter who by all accounts had had, for many years, a loving and close relationship.",
      "Mr Pelicot recalled visiting her in hospital when she was recovering from surgery as a child so he could hold her and comfort her, and shared memories of her teenage years.",
      "When he repeated that he would always love her even if she had stopped loving him, she looked ahead silently, tears streaming down her face \u2013 but did not respond.",
      "It was only later, when the session ended, that she approached the box her father sat in and shouted: \u201cYou had two months [to tell the truth]!\u201d",
      "Woman describes horror of learning husband drugged her so others could rape her",
      "Final phase for mass rape trial that has horrified France",
      "During questioning, Mr Pelicot also stated that he was a sex addict and that getting found out by police in November 2020 had \u201cunburdened him\u201d.",
      "He denied that his crimes against his wife had been sparked by an inferiority complex or by a desire for revenge for an affair she had in the 1980s.",
      "Asked what he thought about chemical submission - drugging someone for the purposes of coercion or assault - he answered: \u201cIt\u2019s crap. It annihilates everything. It should never be done.\u201d",
      "Mr Pelicot\u2019s statements were followed by closing arguments from Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s legal team.",
      "Lawyers for the 50 other defendants will give their own closing arguments from next week. They are expected to explore more deeply the defence that many of the men cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her.",
      "Over almost three hours Ms Pelicot's lawyers, Antoine Camus and St\u00e9phane Babonneau, retold the horrific story of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s crimes, peppering their account with literary references.",
      "\"Everyone contributed to this monstrosity on their own level, and allowed a woman's ordeal to go on. It's the banality of evil of [philosopher] Hannah Arendt,\" said Mr Camus.",
      "They pleaded with the judges to hand down sentences that reflected the extent of the suffering of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and her family.",
      "Mr Camus said he was aware of the \u201cexpectations and hopes in this room and beyond\u201d for the trial, which he said he described as historic, because \u201cwe badly, urgently want and need it to be\".",
      "Leaning heavily on the notion of free will, he dismissed the defence\u2019s argument that many of the men who allegedly raped Ms Pelicot did so because they were intimidated, manipulated or tricked by her husband. \"Manipulation is not hypnosis,\" he said.",
      "The fact they were all aware that Mr Pelicot was \u201crecruiting\u201d many other men too should be taken into account by the judges, he added.",
      "\u201cEveryone who came into that house of horrors knew that others had come before him and others would follow,\u201d Mr Camus said.",
      "His colleague painted a devastating picture of Ms Pelicot\u2019s life since her husband\u2019s crimes had become known.",
      "St\u00e9phane Babonneau then described what had led Ms Pelicot \u2013 who by then was living in a small village under her maiden name \u2013 to give up her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "It was in 2023, he said, when French media began reporting on the Pelicot case  using pseudonyms that \u201ca feeling of rebellion started to take hold of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\".",
      "\"She decided to take back control of her life. The moment had come for shame to change sides.\u201d",
      "The will to stop hiding had awoken in her, he said, because she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. And she thought the details of her case and the videos of the alleged assaults would help expose the reality of rape.",
      "\u201cFor her story to be useful and to help other women she understood she had to give up the anonymity that had served her for years,\u201d Mr Babonneau explained. \u201cShe had to accept she would forever be the victim of the Mazan rapes.\u201d",
      "The lawyer also urged judges not to accept that the defendants had made a \u201cmistake\u201d when \u2013 as some have said \u2013 they raped Ms Pelicot involuntarily or \u201cout of stupidity or ignorance\u201d.",
      "\u201cIf you accept the right to make a mistake, what will stop another man tomorrow from saying that when a woman told him \u2018no\u2019 he actually understood \u2018yes\u2019? That he also made a mistake?\u201d",
      "\u201cI ask you to reject the right to make mistakes which would put society in danger \u2013 and at the risk of seeing more Gis\u00e8le Pelicots,\u201d Mr Babonneau said.",
      "He ended by paying tribute to Ms Pelicot and said the trial would be a \u201clegacy\u201d for future generations: \u201cThey will hear the name Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, they will hear about her courage and about the price she paid.\u201d",
      "Turning to look at Ms Pelicot, he said: \u201cYou did your job. You went beyond what was expected of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, pass on the torch to the others to carry on the fight you never chose.\u201d",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, to his right, wiped her eyes."

      "Two women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them \"for sex\", their lawyer, Joel Leppard, told CBS this week. One of the women also testified that she witnessed the then-congressman having sex with a minor during a party in 2017, the lawyer said.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

      "What does the ICC do?",
      "The court, in the Dutch city of The Hague, was established in 2002 to hold rogue leaders responsible for atrocities to account.",
      "World leaders had increasingly pushed for its creation in the wake of the Yugoslav wars and the Rwandan Genocide.",
      "It is a court of last resort, intervening only when national authorities cannot, or will not, prosecute.",
      "It can only deal with crimes committed after 1 July 2002, when the Rome Statute - which established the court - came into force.",
      "The Rome Statute has been ratified by 124 countries. A further 34 have signed and may ratify it in the future.",
      "However, Israel is not a member and the US is another notable absence.",
      "What cases has the ICC pursued?",
      "The court's first verdict, in March 2012, was against Thomas Lubanga, the leader of a militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "He was convicted of war crimes relating to the use of children in that country's conflict and sentenced in July to 14 years.",
      "The highest profile person to be brought to the ICC is Ivory Coast's former President Laurent Gbagbo. He was charged in 2011 with murder, rape, persecution and \"other inhumane acts\", but acquitted of all charges.",
      "Joseph Kony, the leader of the Uganda-based Lords Resistance Army, is among those wanted by the ICC",
      "Among those wanted by the ICC is Joseph Kony, leader of Uganda's rebel movement, the Lord's Resistance Army. He is charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the abduction of thousands of children.",
      "The court also has an outstanding arrest warrant for ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "The ICC has been criticised, particularly by the African Union, for its focus on Africa. However, it denies any bias, pointing to the fact that some cases were self-referred by the country affected, or referred to it by the UN.",
      "In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The court alleges he is responsible for war crimes, and has focused its claims on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "How does the court put suspects on trial?",
      "The ICC has no police force of its own to track down and arrest suspects.",
      "Instead it must rely on national police services to make arrests and seek their transfer to The Hague.",
      "A prosecutor begins an investigation if a case is referred either by the UN Security Council or by a ratifying state.",
      "He or she can also take independent action, but prosecutions have to be approved by a panel of judges.",
      "Both the prosecutor and the judges are elected by the states taking part in the court.",
      "When a case goes to trial, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Three judges consider all the evidence and then issue a verdict and, if the accused is found guilty, sentence.",
      "Why isn't the US an ICC member?",
      "During negotiations to establish the ICC, the US argued that its soldiers might be the subject of politically motivated or frivolous prosecutions.",
      "In a much-criticised decision in July 2002, the UN Security Council voted on a compromise that gave US troops a 12-month exemption from prosecution, to be renewed annually.",
      "But the Security Council - prompted by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan - refused to renew the exemption in June 2004, after pictures of US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners shocked the world.",
      "The court's operation is seen as weakened without US involvement.",
      "However, Washington has not ruled out co-operation with the court in particular cases.",

      "A number of important countries are not under the jurisdiction of the ICC.",
      "Some, including China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey, have not signed the treaty.",
      "Others, including Israel, Egypt, Iran, and Russia, have signed but have not ratified it.",
      "How does the ICC affect each nation's courts?",
      "States that join the treaty may want to make sure that they themselves are able to prosecute all the crimes that it covers - otherwise the court may intervene.",
      "Some governments have already introduced legislation to make changes to their own judicial systems.",
      "Who pays for the ICC?",
      "The states which take part. This is according to the same rules that govern their contributions to the UN - roughly based on their national wealth.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 07:24:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Illegal miners live dangerously, but make roaring profits selling gold on the black-market.",
    "story": [
      "Along with about 600 other men, Ndumiso lives and works in a small gang-controlled \"town\" - complete with markets and a red light district - that has grown up deep underground at a disused gold mine in South Africa.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that after being laid off by a big mining firm, he decided to join the gang in its underground world to become what is known as a \"zama zama\", an illegal miner.",
      "He digs for the precious metal and surfaces every three months or so to sell it on the black market for a huge profit, earning more than he ever did before - though the risks now are far higher.",
      "\"The underground life is ruthless. Many do not make it out alive,\" said the 52-year-old, who spoke to the BBC on condition that his real name was not used as he feared reprisals.",
      "\"In one level of the shaft there are bodies and skeletons. We call that the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "But for those who survive, like Ndumiso, the job can be lucrative.",
      "While he sleeps on sandbags after back-breaking days underground, his family lives in a house he has bought in a township of the main city, Johannesburg.",
      "He made cash payments of 130,000 rand (about $7,000; \u00a35,600) for the one-bedroom house, which he has now extended to include another three bedrooms, he said.",
      "An illegal miner for about eight years, Ndumiso has managed to send his three children to fee-paying schools - one of whom is now in university.",
      "\"I have to provide for my wife and children and this is the only way I know,\" he said, adding that he preferred to toil underground rather than adding to the high crime rate by becoming a car-hijacker or robber, after spending many years trying to find legal work.",
      "His current job is at a mine in the small town of Stilfontein, around 90 miles (145km) south-west of Johannesburg, which is at the centre of global attention after a government minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, promised to \"smoke out\" the hundreds of miners who were underground there, with the security forces preventing food and water from being sent down.",
      "\"Criminals are not to be helped. Criminals are to be persecuted,\" Ntshavheni said.",
      "A campaign group, The Society for the Protection of Our Constitution, has launched a court case to demand access to the mineshaft, which police say is about 2km (1.2 miles) deep.",
      "The court has given an interim ruling, stating that food and other essentials could be delivered to the miners.",
      "Ndumiso works at a different shaft at the mine, and surfaced last month, before the current stand-off.",
      "He is now waiting to see how the situation unfolds, before deciding whether to return.",
      "The stand-off follows a government decision to crack down on an industry that has spiralled out of control, with mafia-like gangs running it.",
      "\"The country has been grappling with the scourge of illegal mining for many years, and mining communities bore the brunt of peripheral criminal activities such as rape, robbing and damage to public infrastructure, among others,\" said Mikateko Mahlaule, chairman of the parliamentary committee on mineral resources.",
      "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the mine was a \"crime scene\",  but police were negotiating with the miners to end the stand-off, rather than going down to arrest them.",
      "\"Law-enforcement authorities have information that some of the miners may be heavily armed. It is well-established that illegal miners are recruited by criminal gangs and form part of wider organised crime syndicates,\" he added.",
      "Ndumiso was among hundreds of thousands of workers - both locals and nationals of neighbouring states like Lesotho - who have been retrenched as South Africa's mining industry has gone into decline over the last three decades. Many of these have gone on to become \"zama zamas\" at the abandoned mines.",
      "South Africa-based Benchmark Foundation researcher David van Wyk, who has studied the industry, said there were about 6,000 abandoned mines in the country.",
      "\"While they are not profitable for large-scale industrial mining, they are profitable for small-scaling mining,\" he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Ndumiso said he used to work as a drill operator, earning less than $220 (\u00a3175) a month, for a gold-mining company until he was laid off in 1996.",
      "After struggling for the next 20 years to find a full-time job because of South Africa's crushingly high unemployment rate, he said he decided to become an illegal miner.",
      "There are tens of thousands of illegal miners in South Africa, with Mr Van Wyk saying they number about 36,000 alone in Gauteng province - the country's economic heartland, where gold was first discovered in the 19th Century.",
      "\"Zama zamas will often spend months underground without surfacing and depend heavily on outside support for food and other necessities. It is arduous and dangerous work,\" said a report by campaign group Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime.",
      "\"Some carry pistols, shotguns and semi-automatic weapons to protect themselves from rival gangs of miners,\" it added.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that he did own a pistol, but he also paid his gang a monthly \"protection fee\" of about $8.",
      "Its heavily armed guards fend off threats, especially from Lesotho gangs reputed to have more lethal firepower, he said.",
      "Under the 24-hour protection of the gang, Ndumiso said he used dynamite for rock-blasting and rudimentary tools such as a pick axe, spade and chisel to find gold.",
      "Most of what he finds he gives to the gang leader, who pays him a minimum of $1,100 every two weeks. He said he was able to keep some gold, which he sells on the black market to top up his income.",
      "He was among the fortunate miners to have such an arrangement, he said - explaining that others were kidnapped and taken to the shaft to work like slave labourers, receiving no payment or gold.",
      "Ndumiso said he normally stayed underground for about three months at a time, and then came up for two to four weeks to spend time with his family and sell his gold, before going back into the deep pits.",
      "\"I look forward to sleeping on my bed and eating home-cooked meals. Breathing in fresh air is an amazingly powerful feeling.\"",
      "Ndumiso does not come out more often in case he loses his digging spot, but after three months it gets too much to remain underground.",
      "He recalled that once when he reached the surface: \"I was so blinded by the sunlight that I thought I had gone blind.\"",
      "His skin had also become so pale that his wife took him for a medical check-up: \"I was honest with the doctor about where I lived. He did not say anything, and just treated me. He gave me vitamins.\"",
      "Above ground Ndumiso does not just relax. He also works with other illegal miners as ore-bearing rocks brought up from below are blasted and crushed into fine powder.",
      "This is then \"washed\" by his group at a makeshift plant to separate the gold using dangerous chemicals like mercury and sodium cyanide.",
      "Ndumiso said he then sells his share of the gold - one gram for $55, less than the official price of about $77.",
      "He said he has a ready-made buyer, whom he contacts via WhatsApp.",
      "\"The first time I met him I did not trust him so I told him to meet me in the car park of a police station. I knew I would be safe there.",
      "\"Now we meet in any car park. We have a scale. We weigh the gold on the spot. I then hand it to over to him, and he pays me in cash,\" he said, pointing out that he  walks away with between $3,800 and $5,500.",
      "He gets this amount every three months, meaning his average annual income is between $15,500 and $22,000 - far more than the $2,700 he earned as a legally employed miner.",
      "Ndumiso said the gang leaders earned far more, but he did not know how much.",
      "As for the buyer of his gold, Ndumiso said he did not know anything about him, except that he was a white man in an illegal industry that involves people of different races and classes.",
      "This makes it difficult to clamp down on the criminal networks, with Mr Van Wyk saying the government was targeting miners - but not the \"kingpins living in the leafy suburbs of Johannesburg and Cape Town\".",
      "Mr Ramaphosa said that illegal mining was costing \"our economy billions of rands in lost export income, royalties and taxes\", and the government would continue to work with mining firms \"to ensure they take responsibility for rehabilitating or closing mines that are no longer operational\".",
      "Mr Van Wyk told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast that the government would worsen South Africa's economic crisis if it clamped down on the \"zama zamas\".",
      "\"There should be a policy to decriminalise their operations, to better organise them and to regulate them,\" he added.",
      "When Ndumiso goes back underground to work, he takes with him cartons of canned food to avoid paying the exorbitant prices at the \"markets\" that exist there.",
      "Apart from food, basic items - like cigarettes, torches, batteries - and mining tools were sold there, he said.",
      "This suggests that a community - or a small town - had developed underground over the years, with Ndumiso saying there was even a red light district, with sex workers brought underground by the gangs.",
      "Ndumiso said the mine where he worked was made up of several levels, and a labyrinth of tunnels that connected to each other.",
      "\"They are like highways, with signs painted to give directions to different places and levels - like the level that we use as the toilet, or the level that we call the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "\"Some are killed by rival gang members; others die during rockfalls and are crushed by massive boulders. I lost a friend after he was robbed of his gold and shot in the head.\"",
      "Although life underground is perilous, it is a risk that thousands like Ndumiso are willing to take, as they say the alternative is to live and die poor in a nation where the unemployment rate stands at more than 30%.",

      "The UK manufacturer, Beck Optronic Solutions, which has worked on British Challenger 2 tanks and F35 fighter jets, told us it had not breached sanctions, had no dealings with Russia or Kyrgyzstan, and was unaware of the shipments.",
      "Our investigation raises questions about the effectiveness of sanctions imposed on Russia since the war in Ukraine began.",
      "The trail led us to Valeria Baigascina, a 25-year-old, originally from the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan but now living in Belarus. A part-time model, she posts regularly about her jet-set lifestyle on social media. In the past two years she has visited Dubai, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.",
      "Her social media gave no indication she was also the director of a firm which had channelled millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment to sanctioned companies in Russia, as our search of customs documents revealed.",
      "According to Belarusian registration details, Ms Baigascina was the founder and director of a company called Rama Group LLC. Set up in February 2023, it is registered to an address in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan - 2,300 miles (3,713 km) from her home in Belarus.",
      "Both countries are former Soviet states with strong trading links to Russia. Belarus remains Moscow\u2019s strongest ally in Europe.",
      "Trade data shows that since sanctions on Russia were introduced in February 2022, UK exports to Kyrgyzstan have increased by more than 300%. Experts suspect some goods are actually destined for Moscow.",
      "The customs documents obtained by the BBC suggest that Rama Group made two shipments to Moscow of high-end optics that can be used in missiles, tanks and aircraft.",
      "The equipment is listed on the customs form as being made by Beck Optronic Solutions in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The company manufactures high-precision lenses used in targeting and surveillance systems.",
      "Though some of its lenses are used in healthcare and engineering, Beck\u2019s website details extensive military and defence applications.",
      "The lenses and optical technology sold by Beck Optronics are specifically listed as goods that either cannot be legally exported to Russia, or that need permission from UK authorities before any sale can take place.",
      "The BBC has identified, through customs documents, a total of six shipments of products said to have been made by Beck with a total value of $2.1m (\u00a31.6m) and transferred to Moscow through Rama and another intermediary company, Shisan LLC.",
      "In December 2023 and January 2024, Rama Group made its two shipments to Moscow listing them as \u201crotating part of camera\u201d. These shipments went to Sol Group, a company based in Smolensk, 200 miles (320km) south-west of Moscow, which has been sanctioned by the US.",
      "It is not clear what international route the goods took - the documents indicate some of the shipments may actually have originated in Thailand.",
      "Shisan LLC, another Kyrgyz company, was responsible for four further shipments of Beck Optronics\u2019 products worth $1.5m (\u00a31.1m).",
      "Two of those shipments involved \u201cshort-wave infrared camera lens\u201d and went to the Ural Optical & Mechanical Plant, which makes bomb-aiming equipment and is also sanctioned because of its links to the Russian military.",
      "Rama Group and Shisan share the same address in Bishkek - a modern five-storey block in a prosperous part of the city. However, when we visited we were told Valeria Baigascina was out of the country on a business trip.",
      "We found her number through her social media posts and put our allegations to her.",
      "Ms Baigascina said she was the founder of the company but had sold it in May. She denied the allegations, saying that when she had owned it, \u201cnothing like that was supplied\u201d. She then hung up.",
      "Later, by email, she told us the accusations were \u201cridiculous\u201d and based on \u201cfalse information\u201d.",
      "Our research shows that in May this year she sold Rama Group to her best friend, Angelina Zhurenko, who runs a lingerie business in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ms Zhurenko told us: \u201cTrading activities are carried out exclusively within the framework of the current legislation of Kyrgyzstan. The company does not violate any prohibitions. Any other information is false.\u201d",
      "The director of the other intermediary company, Shisan, is listed as Evgeniy Anatolyevich Matveev. We put our allegations to him by email.",
      "He told us that our information was \u201cfalse\u201d and that he ran \u201ca business supplying exclusively civilian goods manufactured in Asian countries\u201d.",
      "He continued: \u201cThis does not contradict the laws of the state in which I work, and has nothing to do with US sanctions, because it is impossible to prohibit free trade in Asian goods available for sale and delivery.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that Beck Optronics knew about these shipments or that the final destination of the lenses was Russia.",
      "The company told us it had nothing to do with the shipments: \u201cBeck has not shipped anything contrary to UK export controls or any sanctions applying in the UK. It has had no dealings with any party or company in Russia, Kyrgyzstan or Thailand, was not aware that any shipments might ultimately be destined for any of these destinations and has not shipped anything to these destinations.\u201d",
      "It believes some of the equipment listed wasn\u2019t even made by the company and that customs documents may have been falsified.",

      "Over the same six-month period, Rama Group completed a total of 1,756 shipments to Russia. Of these, 1,355 were for items on the \u201chigh-priority battlefield items\u201d list.",
      "Its most recent shipments, including electronics by US and UK companies, went to a Russian company named Titan-Mikro, which has been subject to US sanctions since May 2023 for operating within Russia\u2019s military sector.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:56:43 GMT",
    "summary": "In a dispute involving band NewJeans, the government said celebrities were not entitled to the same rights as workers.",
    "story": [
      "They have sold more albums than any other K-pop girl band last year, gained tens of millions of fans worldwide and are arguably one of South Korea's hottest acts.",
      "What the members of NewJeans are not, however, are workers, according to the government.",
      "The country's Ministry of Employment and Labor on Wednesday dismissed claims of workplace harrassment against a member of the group, saying celebrities were not seen as workers under the country's labour law - and were, therefore, not entitled to the same rights.",
      "The decision has drawn its fair share of scorn, with people saying they are not surprised given this is an industry known for its punishing schedules and intense competition.",
      "This is the latest scandal to hit NewJeans, which has for months been embroiled in a public feud with its record label, Ador.",
      "With slick pop songs like Super Shy, OMG and Supernatural, NewJeans were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this year's MTV Awards.",
      "Formed by label Ador in 2022, the group has five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - whose ages range from 16 to 20.",
      "The incident started after 20-year-old Hanni and the other four members of the band raised concerns about their treatment by Ador during an impromptu YouTube livestream on 11 September.",
      "In the band's YouTube video, which has since been deleted, they made claims of workplace harassment, among others, which culminated in Hanni saying she would testify in a hearing about bullying in the music industry.",
      "The Vietnamese-Australian singer, whose real name is Pham Ngoc Han, told lawmakers that she felt \"the company hated us\".",
      "She described how senior members of Hybe ignored her and her bandmates, and gave them cold shoulder. She also alleged that employees of the agency bad-mouthed NewJeans on internal communication app and asked a journalist to downplay the group's record sales in one article.",
      "Hybe had previously denied the accusations. The CEO of Ador, which is a subsidiary of Hybe, said at the hearing that she would \"listen more closely\" to her artists.",
      "Her allegations prompted fans to file a petition about workplace bullying to the government.",
      "But on Wednesday, South Korea's labour ministry rejected these claims, saying given the content and nature of the management contract signed by Hanni, she is not regarded as a worker under the country's Labour Standards Act.",
      "\"Individuals must meet the criteria under the Labour Standards Act... to be considered workers. This includes having fixed working hours and providing labour under the employer\u2019s direct supervision and control. Celebrities, including singers, are typically classified as independent contractors,\" Chunghwan Choi, senior partner of Yulchon law firm in Seoul explained.",
      "The government also cites the nature of Hanni's income, which is deemed to be \"profit sharing, rather than wages\", according to local reports, adding that she pays business income tax rather than employment income tax.",
      "One expert has called the response \"utterly unfair and yet unsurprising\".",
      "The work for K-pop idols is \"emotionally and physically exhausting\", according to her, as they work \"incredibly long hours, often seven days a week for months in a row...[with] no clearly defined periods of rest\", says CedarBough Saeji, Assistant Professor of Korean and East Asian Studies at Pusan National University in South Korea.",
      "\"Exploitation of the workers is accepted because they are not regular employees and there is no labour union, or clearly we can now see, no governmental agency to advocate for humane working conditions for them,\" she argues.",

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:50:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Moscow's forces have taken more ground since September than they did over the course of 2023, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden\u2019s decision to provide anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, and allow the use of long-range missiles on Russian territory comes as the Russian military is accelerating its gains along the front line.",
      "Data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) shows that Russia has gained almost six times as much territory in 2024 as it did in 2023, and is advancing towards key Ukrainian logistical hubs in the eastern Donbas region.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region is faltering. Russian troops have pushed Kyiv's offensive backwards. Experts have questioned the success of the offensive, with one calling it a \"strategic catastrophe\" given manpower shortages faced by Ukraine.",
      "These developments come at a time of heightened uncertainty with a second Donald Trump administration looming. The US president-elect has vowed to bring the war to a close when he takes office in January, with some fearing he could cut future military aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia advances in eastern Ukraine",
      "In the first few months of the war the front line moved quickly, with Russia gaining ground quickly before being pushed back by a Ukrainian counteroffensive. But in 2023 neither side made any major gains - with the conflict largely sliding into a stalemate.",
      "But new ISW figures suggest the story in 2024 is more favourable for Russia. The ISW bases its analysis on confirmed social media footage and reports of troop movements.",
      "The ISW data shows Moscow\u2019s forces have seized around 2,700 sq km of Ukrainian territory so far this year, compared with just 465 sq km in the whole of 2023, a near six-fold increase.",
      "Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London, suggested to the BBC that there was a possibility the Ukrainian eastern front \u201cmight actually collapse\u201d if Russia continued to advance at pace.",
      "More than 1000 sq km was taken between 1 September and 3 November, suggesting the push accelerated in recent months. Two areas bearing the brunt of these advances are Kupiansk in Kharkiv region, and Kurakhove, a stepping stone to the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region.",
      "Kupiansk and areas to the east of the Oskil river were liberated in the Kharkiv offensive of 2022, but Russia has progressively retaken the latter area. In a recent intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were trying to breach the north-eastern outskirts of the city.",
      "Footage posted on 13 November and verified by the BBC is consistent with this analysis. The video shows a convoy of Russian armour being repelled after making it to within 4km of the key bridge at Kupiansk, the last major road crossing in the area.",
      "While these reports do not necessarily translate to control of an area, it is indicative of how stretched Ukraine\u2019s defensive line has become.",
      "Elsewhere, since retaking the city of Vuhledar in October - an elevated position which sits above key supply lines and which Moscow spent two years fighting for - Russia has thrown resources at Kurakhove.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces defending the city have so far repelled attacks to the south and east. But the front line creeps ever closer, with Russia also threatening to encircle defenders from the north and west.",
      "Col Yevgeny Sasyko, a former head of strategic communications with Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia places \u201cpowerful jaws\u201d around the flanks of a city that slowly \u201cgrind though\u201d defences until they collapse.",
      "Footage from the city verified by the BBC showed massive destruction, with residential buildings heavily damaged.",
      "The ISW concludes Moscow now holds a total of 110,649 sq km in Ukraine. For comparison, Ukrainian forces seized just over 1,171 sq km in the first month of its incursion into Kursk - though Russian forces have now retaken nearly half of that territory.",

      "Biden agrees to give Ukraine anti-personnel mines",
      "What we know about missile system Ukraine has used to strike Russia",
      "What arms are the US, UK and other nations supplying?",
      "Despite its territorial gains, Russia's advance has come at a huge cost.",
      "An analysis carried out by BBC Russian confirmed that at least 78,329 troops have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow\u2019s losses from September to November this year more than one-and-a-half times greater than the same period in 2023.",
      "The losses are compounded by the \u201cmeat grinder\u201d approach said to be favoured by Russian commanders - describing the waves of recruits thrown towards Ukrainian positions in a bid to exhaust troops.",
      "Despite the Russian advances, some experts have noted that the actual speed of the offensive is still slow. David Handelman, a military analyst, suggested Ukrainian troops in the east were slowly withdrawing to preserve manpower and resources, rather than suffering from a broader collapse.",
      "The Kursk gambit",
      "Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August. It is unclear why Russia took so long to respond to the operation, which saw Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly gain control over a number of border communities.",
      "Dr Miron suggested that while the Kremlin would suffer a domestic political cost for as long as the incursion continued, Russia\u2019s general staff had been keen to keep Ukraine\u2019s forces tied down in Kursk as its forces made gains elsewhere along the front line.",
      "But Moscow is now clearly intent on reclaiming the territory lost on its own soil. Some 50,000 troops have been deployed to the region.",
      "Verified videos from the Kursk region show fierce fighting is taking place - and that Russia is suffering considerable losses in terms of manpower and equipment. But the data clearly shows Ukraine\u2019s control of the region is shrinking.",
      "Since the start of October, Russian counter-attacks have regained some 593 sq km worth of territory in the border region, ISW figures showed.",
      "The Kursk incursion was initially a major boon for Ukraine in terms of morale at a time of serious setbacks, and the audacity of the operation was a reminder of its ability to surprise and harm its enemy.",
      "But Dr Miron said while the Kursk incursion was a moment of \u201ctactical brilliance\u201d it has also been a \u201cstrategic catastrophe\u201d for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea was to maybe gain some political leverage in potential negotiations, but militarily to draw the Russian forces away from the Donbas in order to liberate Kursk. And what we're seeing instead is that Ukrainian units are tied down there.\u201d",
      "Some of Kyiv\u2019s most experienced and effective units are known to be fighting in Kursk. Mechanised units equipped with state-of-the-art Western armour are also involved in the offensive.",
      "Ukrainian leaders had hinted that they hoped the incursion would force Moscow to redirect some of its forces from eastern Ukraine, slowing the Russian advance there. Instead, experts say most reinforcements were moved to Kursk from parts in Ukraine where the fighting is not as intense.",
      "\u201cAccording to Ukrainian soldiers from different parts of the front, the Russian troops reinforcing Kursk were mainly pulled from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia,\u201d Yurri Clavilier, a land analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the BBC.",
      "\u201cThe fighting there is not as intense as it is in the East. Some Russian units attacking Kharkiv were also redirected to Kursk as Ukraine managed to stall the Russian onslaught there,\u201d he added.",
      "The importance of territory to both sides is the strength it lends to their position in any potential negotiations. Although no peace negotiations have been discussed, US President-elect Trump has claimed he could end the war within 24 hours, without saying exactly how.",
      "Fears persist in Ukraine that Trump could cut military aid as a means to force Kyiv to the table. President Volodymyr Zelensky told Fox News on Tuesday \"I think we will lose [the war]\" if cuts are pushed through.",
      "\"We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail and I think it's not enough to survive,\" he said.",
      "\u200b\u200bOn Tuesday, Ukraine fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia for the first time - a day after Washington gave it permission to do so.\u200b\u200b It is thought that the decision was made in part to help Ukraine hold on to part of the Kursk region, to help use as a bargaining chip in future negotiations.",
      "Dr Miron told the BBC that Russia\u2019s advance has handed them a stronger negotiating position as Trump\u2019s new foreign policy team prepare to take office.",
      "\u201cWhat they're controlling right now, it does give them a certain advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it came to negotiations, I'm sure that as the Russian side has been stressing, \u2018we will do it based on the battlefield configuration\u2019.",

    "summary": "Harvesting olives is an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but it is increasingly precarious.",
    "story": [
      "On a Thursday afternoon towards the end of last month, a 59-year-old Palestinian woman set out to gather olives on her family\u2019s land near the village of Faqqua, in the north of the occupied West Bank.",
      "It was something that Hanan Abu Salameh had done for decades.",
      "Within minutes, the mother of seven and grandmother of 14 lay dying in the dust of the olive grove, with a bullet wound in her chest - she\u2019d been shot by an Israeli soldier.",
      "Even though the family had co-ordinated their intention to pick olives with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to her son Fares and husband Hossam, the soldier fired several shots as other family members fled for cover.",
      "The IDF says it\u2019s investigating the incident, but Hanan\u2019s grieving relatives have little hope or expectation that her killer will be brought to justice.",
      "This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident.",
      "Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently",
      "Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village",
      "Harvesting olives is an age-old ritual and also an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but, according to the UN, it is increasingly precarious.",
      "Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks, like organised attacks by Israeli settlers seeking to sabotage the olive harvest, along with the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.",
      "\u201cLast year we couldn\u2019t even harvest our olives, except for a very small amount,\u201d says Omar Tanatara, a farmer from the village of Umm Safa.",
      "\u201cAt one point, the army came, threw the olives we\u2019d already gathered on the ground, and ordered us to go home,\u201d says Omar, who is also a member of the village council.",
      "\u201cSome people were even shot at and olives trees were cut down with saws \u2013 that\u2019s how we later found them,\u201d adds Omar, as he and other villagers use small hand-held rakes to pull this year\u2019s harvest from their remaining trees while they can.",
      "Even when Israeli and international activists accompany villagers to their olive groves, hoping to deter the threat, there\u2019s no guarantee of safety.",
      "Zuraya Hadad instinctively winces as we watch a video of the incident in which her ribs were broken by a masked man wielding a large stick.",
      "The Israeli peace activist had been helping Palestinian farmers pick their olives when she was assaulted without provocation.",
      "Rather than arresting her attacker, Israeli soldiers, who\u2019d accompanied settlers to the site, just told him to move on.",
      "\u201cEven when we come to help, it doesn't guarantee that the Palestinians can harvest their olives,\u201d Zuraya tells me as she recovers from her injuries at home.",
      "\u201cWe try to raise awareness, but in the end it's either the settlers steal the olives or cut the trees, or they remain unpicked and go to waste.\u201d",
      "Land is at the heart of the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians - who controls it and who has access to it.",
      "For thousands of Palestinian families and villages, cultivating and harvesting olives is a big part of their economy.",
      "But many say that, in recent times, access to trees on their land has been impeded, often violently by Israeli settlers.",
      "Hundreds of trees - which can take years to reach fruit-bearing maturity - have been deliberately burned or cut down, says the UN.",
      "More than 96,000 dunums (approximately 96 sq km; 37 sq miles) of olive groves in the West Bank also went uncultivated in 2023 because of Israeli restrictions on access for Palestinian farmers.",
      "After being gathered by hand, villagers from Umm Safa take sacks full of olives to the nearby factory, where the presses have restarted this season.",
      "Olives are the most important agricultural product in the West Bank. In a good year, they're worth more than $70m (\u00a354m) to the Palestinian economy.",
      "But income was well down last year and this year will be even worse, says factory owner Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, as even fewer farmers are able to harvest their crop owing to attacks by settlers.",
      "\u201cLet me give you an example,\u201d he tells me.",
      "\u201cMy brother-in-law in Lubban - next to the Israeli settlement - went to pick his own olives, but they broke his arms and they made him leave along with everyone who was with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe, as Palestinians, don\u2019t have petrol or big companies. Our main agricultural crop is olives,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo, like the Gulf depends on oil, and the Americans on business, our economy is dependent on the olive tree.\u201d",
      "On the hill overlooking the olive groves of Umm Safa stands an illegal settler outpost - a farm.",

      "Over the last year of the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have been emboldened by the support of far-right Israeli ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir.",
      "As national security minister, he has given out free firearms to hundreds of settlers and has encouraged them to assert their right to what - they say - is their \"God-given\" land.",
      "Ben-Gvir has also been accused of openly supporting the disruption of olive harvesting on Palestinian land.",
      "At the olive press, farmers wait patiently in the yard to witness the transformation of the olives they\u2019ve been able to gather this year into \"liquid gold\".",

      "But with the help of some friends, the singer-songwriter released her new album, \"Consequences of the Crown,\" earlier this year, which is her 17th studio album.",
      "Lynne's breakout album \"I am Shelby Lynne\" came after a difficult decision to leave Nashville 25 years ago.",
      "Personal struggles",
      "Lynne, now 56, was 19 when she signed a record deal in Nashville. Her first single was a duet with George Jones.",
      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",
      "The only constant and way to cope for Lynne was music.",
      "\"I think that's why I would turn mean as hell \u2026 just protect, protect, protect. I didn't know what trauma was, or PTSD. I just knew I had to sing,\" Lynne said.",
      "Frustrated with Nashville, Lynne moved to California and changed genres. It worked. In 2000, she made the album that still defines her. \"I Am Shelby Lynne,\" widely considered a soul-pop masterpiece, helped her win a Grammy for best new artist.",
      "Lynne says music \"saved me a hundred times,\" but she struggled with commercial success, sobriety and the legacy of her parents.",
      "\"I mean, now I'm at peace with it, because I love them and it allows me to miss them,\" she said. \"It took me just like a gong in the head going, you know, they did the best they could. They did.\"",
      "Return to Nashville",
      "When Lynne left Nashville, she wasn't planning on coming back. However, after years of living in California, she quietly returned to the South in 2018.",
      "\"To be quite honest, I didn't know if Nashville was mad at me,\" she said.",
      "It's in Nashville where Lynne confronted sobriety and accepted help from friends, something she has never found easy to do.",
      "\"I still got the devil in me, but people like Ashley [Monroe] and Karen [Fairchild] and Gena [Johnson] saved me. They saw me when I was here at my worst and I was really just trying to start over,\" she said.",
      "Songwriters Karen Fairchild of \"Little Big Town\" and Ashley Monroe started writing with Lynne upon her return.",
      "It was Fairchild and Monroe that pushed Lynne to make new music.",
      "\"We kept kind of bugging her about it,\" Fairchild said.",
      "\"'We want a Shelby record,'\" Monroe remembered telling Lynne. \"She's like, 'Nobody wants that.' We do.\"",
      "That persistence paid off.",
      "\"I was so nervous because, I mean, I've held her at the very top of all my lists,\" Monroe said.",
      "Their respect was also matched by their intimidation of working with one of their idols.",
      "\"It's like everybody has this reverence for her,\" Fairchild said of Lynne. \"And also like, there's fear\u2026 because she's a force.\"",
      "Fairchild and Monroe met with Lynne at the studio of engineer Gena Johnson to help create the album. Though hesitant about making new music, with a little help from her friends, Lynne eventually saw it all taking shape.",

      "She said she finally feels like she fits in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm where I need to be,\" Lynne said. \"It is a great feeling. And it also means I can unpack those boxes in the garage. \"",

      "\"I'm really honored for this, thank you very much,\" the always subdued country traditionalist Stapleton said as he accepted the male vocalist of the year award for a record-extending eighth time.",

      "Brooks & Dunn followed it up by winning vocal duo of the year for the 15th time and the first time since 2006.",
      "Shaboozey brought the crowd to its feet with a solo performance that began with a bit of his more sober single \"Highway\" before launching into one of the year's defining hits, \"A Bar Song (Tipsy).\"",
      "But he lost out on best new artist to Megan Moroney, who won minutes after her own performance.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:34:47 -0500",
    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",
      "Dr. Cheng said simply: \"We're working on it.\"",

The Marines told CBS News they have no record of him.",
      "Dating back to at least 2016, Williams has claimed association with the U.S. Marine Corps when talking about his personal biography in video blogs, in his stand-up routines and in interviews viewed and heard by tens of millions of people. His claims of military service seem to not be attached to any of his critically acclaimed jokes or characters he has created for stage and screen but instead, a part of his journey towards comedy.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps tells CBS News there's no record of Williams ever entering military service or attending any Marine Corps recruit training camps.",
      "Multiple emails and phone calls were sent to Williams' publicist, Amy Sisoyev, and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, but no reply was returned for almost two weeks.",
      "Earlier this year, Williams sat down for a nearly 3-hour interview with ESPN's \"First Take\" correspondent Shannon Sharpe on his podcast, \"Club Shay Shay.\" The interview has racked up\u00a0more than 83 million views on YouTube as of publication and is the most watched interview in YouTube's history.",
      "Sharpe, a former Denver Bronco and ex-NFL analyst for CBS Sports, asked Williams about being raised in Florida.",
      "\"I try to join the Marine Corps and they won't accept me because I'm too young, and I've lied and told them I'm 16 and my family is moving down and I don't have my ID but it's coming. And so they [the Marines] let me go to the boot camp,\" said Williams.",
      "Similarly, on comedian Marc Maron's podcast last year, Williams said, \"And then I attempt to join the Marine Corps, and I go off to boot camp and I pass, and then they reveal that I'm too young, and they give me a little ceremony because I did pass, you know, oo-Rah.\"",
      "He added: \"I wasn't even 16. I wasn't even 16. I was already \u2014 I had miscalculated it wrong. I thought that you know, by the time I got back I would be good, but I hadn't turned 16 by the time boot camp was over.\"",
      "Maron, whose \"WTF\" podcast garners more than 55 million listens per year, asked Williams if he got through boot camp and about his ceremony.",
      "Williams reaffirmed that he passed boot camp, saying, \"When you come back everybody gets the ceremony and I was supposed to have been, probably put in the brig or court-martialed or something, but they didn't treat me like that. \u2026 As far as the Marine Corps thing, whatever those commercials were selling, you remember those commercials back in that time \u2026 if you wanted to join a gang, the Marines was the gang to join.\"",
      "On Saturday, CBS News attended the Vulture Festival in Los Angeles where Williams was interviewed about his life and career by Jesse David Fox, a Vulture writer and host of \"Good One: The Podcast About Jokes.\" Williams is set to launch his multistate \"Heaven on Earth\" tour next year.",
      "While Williams did not discuss his alleged short stint in the Marines, the comedian said \"Thank God I tell the truth\" when asked by Fox about his past statements in interviews.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Williams' alleged enlistment in the Marine Corps.",
      "Marine Corps officials searched for records pertaining to Williams using his full name \u2014 Micah Sierra Williams \u2014 and other identifying information such as his date of birth and social security number. Officials told CBS News that their database of official military personnel files dates back to the 1960s, housed at the National Personnel Records Center of the National Archives.",
      "\"We searched the files maintained by the Manpower Management Performance Branch but were unable to identify Mr. Williams as a member or former member of the U.S. Marine Corps,\" wrote an official in response to CBS News' public records request.",
      "Marine Corps officials told CBS News that if Williams' story was accurate, there would be records showing his entry into military service, his graduation and discharge, even if he fraudulently enlisted as a minor.",
      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",
      "While it's unclear when exactly Williams began to claim he graduated from Marine boot camp, the earliest examples CBS News could find stemmed from Williams' 2016 feud with actor and comedian Kevin Hart.",
      "In a video that appears to have been\u00a0recorded by Williams, addressing drug abuse allegations, the comedian says, \"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps, I can only breathe out of one nostril.\"",
      "That same year, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and battery charges after a fight at an apartment complex in Gainesville, Georgia, with a 17-year-old high school wrestler who was also charged, according to previous news reports. Williams pleaded not guilty and the case lingered on until earlier this year when local prosecutors decided to drop the case against Williams.",
      "Soon after his arrest Williams spoke about the episode on stage, suggesting that he wasn't actually put into a chokehold by the teenager and in fact, that Williams had let him win, adding, \"I'm Semper Fi till I die, Marine Corps b----. I passed motherf---ing boot camp at 16.\"",
      "Williams' routine was removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement issues, but the video still exists in the reader forum on Military.com, a military news and culture website. A user posted the video to the website in 2016 and asked: \"Katt Williams a Marine?\"",

      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",
      "\"The amoxicillin your child is getting because they might have an ear infection, or you think you're treating another community-acquired pneumonia, those antibiotics will not be effective against Mycoplasma,\" Nayak said.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",

      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

    "summary": "Canada's Bestar recalled wall beds only after learning of dozens of cases in which its beds detached from the walls, feds say.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It\u00a0operates\u00a0manufacturing plants in Lac-Megantic and Sherbrooke, Canada, as well as in Jamestown, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California and Asia.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",
      "There's no real understanding of how these people can do this, but you can certainly understand why. An emotional Vivek Puri said, \"It's nice to be good at something.\"",

      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",

      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:44:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

      "She first saw the ad on Facebook. And then again on TikTok. After seeing what appeared to be Elon Musk\u00a0offering an investment opportunity over and over again, Heidi Swan figured it had to be true.",
      "\"Looked just like Elon Musk, sounded just like Elon Musk and I thought it was him,\" said Swan.",
      "She contacted the company behind the pitch and opened an account for more than $10,000. The 62-year-old healthcare worker thought she was making a smart investment in cryptocurrency from a businessman and investor worth billions of dollars.",
      "But Swan would soon learn she'd been scammed by a new wave of high-tech thieves using artificial intelligence to create deepfakes.",
      "Even looking back at the videos now, knowing they're fakes, Swan still thinks they look convincing.",
      "\"They still look like Elon Musk,\" she said. \"They still sound like Elon Musk.\"",
      "Deepfake scams on the rise in the U.S.",
      "As artificial intelligence technology evolves and becomes more accessible, these kinds of scams are becoming more common.",
      "According to Deloitte, a leading financial research group, AI-generated content contributed to more than $12 billion in fraud losses last year, and could reach $40 billion in the U.S. by 2027.",
      "Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau have issued warnings that deepfake scams are on the rise.",
      "A study by AI firm Sensity found that Elon Musk is the most common celebrity used in deepfake scams. One likely reason is his wealth and entrepreneurship. Another reason is because of the amount of interviews he's done; the more content there is of someone online, the easier it is to create convincing deepfakes.",
      "Anatomy of a deepfake",
      "At the University of North Texas in Denton, Professor Christopher Meerdo is also using artificial intelligence. But he's using it to create art.",
      "\"It's not going to replace the creative arts,\" Meerdo said. \"It's going to just augment them and change the way that we understand things that we could do in the sphere of creativity.\"",
      "Even though Meerdo sees artificial intelligence as a way to be innovative, he sees its dangers.",
      "Meerdo showed the CBS News Texas I-Team how scammers can take a real video and use AI tools to replace a person's voice and mouth movements, making them appear to say something completely different.",
      "Advances in technology are making it easier to create deepfake videos. All a person who's familiar with AI needs to make one is a single still image and a video recording.",
      "To demonstrate this, Meerdo took a video of investigative reporter Brian New to create a deepfake of Elon Musk.",
      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",
      "\"If you are really trying to scam people, I think you can do some really bad things with this,\" Meerdo said.",
      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",
      "Sensity",
      "Sensity's deepfake detector correctly identified all six clips, showing a heatmap indicating where A.I. manipulation is most likely.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "summary": "Thanksgiving dinners will cost less if you buy store-brand products. Here's how much savings they offer.",
    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "summary": "Americans struggling to stay financially afloat should consider debt relief before tapping into retirement accounts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",

      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",

      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

      "H&R Block and Intuit shares dropped on Tuesday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking at developing a free app for people to file their taxes.",

      "H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% on Tuesday. As the dominant players in tax preparation, H&R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, generate billions in revenue annually by offering online and in-person services.",
      "The Biden Administration in March rolled out a pilot Direct File program through the IRS in 12 states. It allows qualified taxpayers file directly through a federal portal. Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The DOGE, which has been directed by Trump to slash government spending and cut federal regulations, criticized the complexity of the U.S tax code in a Nov. 16 post on X, the social media service owned by Musk.",
      "\"In 1955, there were less than 1.5 million words in the U.S. Tax Code.   Today, there are more than 16 million words,\" its X account wrote. \"Because of this complexity, Americans collectively spend 6.5 billion hours preparing and filing their taxes each year.\"",
      "Intuit and H&R Block also have free filing options.",
      "That said, the Federal Trade Commission earlier in the year barred Intuit from advertising its popular TurboTax product as free when most people have to pay to use it. The FTC in February filed an administrative complaint against H&R Block, alleging it marketed its tax-prep products as free yet deleted the data as a way to pressure them to pay for pricier services.

    "summary": "Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

    "summary": "Spirit's bankruptcy filing will likely mean higher airfares across airlines as it trims schedule, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines, the airline of choice for many budget travelers, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, raising questions about the viability of no-frills airlines in the post-pandemic era, as consumer preferences shift toward more premium offerings.",
      "Customers with plans to fly on the airline over Thanksgiving and beyond are also concerned about what the filing means for their upcoming trips, as well as airfares generally.",
      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",
      "Aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said some consumers who were accustomed to flying Spirit out of major airports may have to fly out of a smaller hub, as Spirit withdraws from major hubs served by legacy carriers.",
      "\"You could see that happen where Spirit decided to compete, and has now decided it wasn't such a good idea,\" he said.",
      "What will happen to airfares?",
      "Spirit and other low-cost carriers have helped depress airfares, even for consumers who don't fly on budget airlines.",
      "\"Whether you like them or not, having ultra low-cost carriers is good for our overall aviation ecosystem and good for consumers, even if you never buy them,\" Kelly said.",
      "Spirit will emerge a smaller airline, which means there will be fewer low-cost flights on most routes, and airfares could rise across the board.",
      "\"The smaller Spirit is and the less routes they serve, the less pressure there will be on other airlines in those markets, resulting in overall higher fares,\" Kelly said. \"This isn't good for consumers. There's no positive side to this.\"",

      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz announced Thursday that he is withdrawing his nomination for attorney general.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to lead the Justice Department as the nation's top law enforcement officer last week. He swiftly resigned his seat in the House and was on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, meeting with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who would oversee his confirmation hearings.",
      "Gaetz said in a social media post that while he had \"excellent meetings\" with senators, his confirmation battle was taking away from the work of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" he wrote on social media. \"There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.\"",
      "He added, \"I remain fully committed to see that Donald J. Trump is the most successful President in history. I will forever be honored that President Trump nominated me to lead the Department of Justice and I'm certain he will Save America.\"",
      "In response to Gaetz's decision, Trump wrote on social media, \"I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect.\"",
      "He predicted Gaetz \"has a wonderful future.\" ahead.",
      "Gaetz called both Trump and Vance separately to inform them of his decision, CBS News confirmed.",
      "Gaetz's nomination was swiftly shrouded in controversy as he was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a \"smear.\" Gaetz blamed the probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose ouster Gaetz helped lead last year.",
      "The Justice Department also conducted an investigation into Gaetz involving allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Several senators expressed concerns about installing Gaetz as attorney general, raising doubts that he would win confirmation even with Republicans in control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins in January. Some then indicated that his decision to remove himself as the attorney general candidate was the right one.",
      "\"I think the decision to withdraw the nomination is the right decision to make,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said. He continued: \"I thought from the beginning, as I shared earlier, I thought it was problematic. And I think you know, as some of our members have expressed, as they've learned more about it, there was perhaps some information out there that the president was not aware of when he made the original recommendation.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota, said he is \"grateful\" Gaetz withdrew, while Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said \"there were a lot of red flags.\"",
      "\"I think that he has put country first, and I'm pleased with his decision,\" she said.",
      "It is the first major blow to Trump's efforts to fill his Cabinet and key administration posts for his second term in office. The president-elect's pick for secretary of defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, is also under scrutiny after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017. A police report provided details of the incident, which Hegseth said at the time was consensual. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came just two days before the Ethics Committee was set to meet to discuss whether to release a report detailing its years-long investigation into the Florida Republican. Because he stepped down from his position in the House upon his selection to lead the Justice Department, the committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz ended, raising questions about whether the panel's report would be released.",
      "The Ethics Committee did convene Wednesday and considered the report's release. But lawmakers said the panel, divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, did not reach agreement. The committee planned to reconvene on Dec. 5 \"to further consider this matter,\" Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters after the initial meeting.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it was looking into allegations against Gaetz of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts and giving \"special privileges and favors,\" and obstructing the investigations into his conduct. House investigators interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and issued 25 subpoenas, the committee said in a rare statement.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the committee that they had been paid to go to parties attended by Gaetz that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the Ethics Committee.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients\u00a0testified before the Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",
      "Leppard said following Gaetz's withdrawal that his \"clients are relieved to have this chapter behind them and eager to move forward with their lives. We're hopeful this brings final closure for all parties involved.\"",
      "Confirmation hearings for Gaetz before the Judiciary Committee would not have taken place until early next year, but Republican and Democratic senators have been pushing to see the Ethics Committee's report as they considered his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Guest, chairman of the Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's decision to pull himself from consideration ends his panel's involvement.",
      "\"I think that this should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter,\" he told reporters. \"He has withdrawn his nomination. He is no longer a member of Congress, and so I think that this settles any involvement that the Ethics Committee should have in any matters involving Mr. Gaetz.\"",

      "Kennedy has spread misleading claims about vaccine safety and is a leader in the movement against vaccine mandates. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy would oversee a sprawling 80,000 employee agency that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the Indian Health Service. The human services portion of the HHS portfolio includes the Administration for Children and Families and its Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with caring for undocumented and unaccompanied children apprehended along the border.",
      "Kennedy would have the authority as HHS secretary to establish regulations related to food and drug safety and public health. He would be able to declare public health emergencies and would be involved in coordinating federal responses to widespread health crises, such as epidemics.",
      "Secretary of Homeland Security",
      "Trump announced on Tuesday that he will nominate South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be secretary of homeland security. He said in the announcement that Noem \"will work closely with 'Border Czar' Tom Homan to secure the border.\" The Biden administration's outgoing homeland security secretary is Alejando Mayorkas, who previously served as a deputy secretary of homeland security, and before that, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "This department is responsible for a broad range of domestic security concerns, with a mandate that includes anti-terrorism, border security and immigration, as well as disaster prevention and management. Trump made immigration and border issues the central focus of his campaign, and has promised to launch a mass deportation effort aimed at removing millions of people from the United States.",
      "If confirmed, Noem would be the primary Trump Cabinet member coordinating his nationwide effort to deport millions of immigrants \u2014 an endeavor that would involve not only various DHS agencies, but also the Justice Department, state and local law enforcement and potentially the Defense Department.",
      "Secretary of Housing and Urban Development",

Rubio is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is a China hawk with extensive foreign policy experience.",
      "As the head of the State Department, Rubio would be Trump's top adviser on foreign policy and international relations. Rubio would oversee a global network of embassies and consulates, and nearly 80,000 employees dedicated to the nation's diplomacy.

      "The secretary of transportation oversees the nation's complex federal network of highways and railroads, as well as pipelines, aviation and trucking regulation. Duffy would take on the role at a precarious time, as East coast dockworkers are in stalled contract negotiations and nearing a possible strike in January. The secretaries of transportation and labor would have key roles in navigating a potential crisis that could snarl supply chains and cause severe economic consequences in the early days of the new administration.",

      "Gabbard has never worked in intelligence. Her views on Russia, opposition to U.S. intervention in Ukraine, and a 2017 meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad have drawn criticism. The current director is Avril Haines, a former deputy national security advisor and deputy director of the CIA.",
      "The head of the national intelligence community, a key adviser to the president, leads the 17 civilian and military agencies tasked with conducting intelligence gathering and analysis in support of the country's national security and foreign policy interests.",
      "As DNI, Gabbard would be involved with managing intelligence and response to terrorism-related events, overseeing the national intelligence program and advising the Homeland Security Council. Perhaps her most important role would be one that would put in her regular contact with Trump: the President's Daily Brief. Coordinated by the director of national intelligence's office, this daily summary of high-level information and analysis on national security issues is provided only to the president and key advisers.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An Alabama prisoner convicted of the 1994 murder of a female hitchhiker is slated Thursday to become the third person executed in the U.S., and Alabama, by nitrogen gas.",
    "story": [
      "An Alabama prisoner convicted of the 1994 murder of a female hitchhiker is slated to become the third person executed in the U.S., and Alabama, by nitrogen gas on Thursday. The United States Supreme Court denied a final petition to halt the execution Thursday afternoon, paving the way for it to go ahead as planned.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama on her way to her mother's home in Louisiana. He is scheduled to be executed Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in south Alabama.",
      "Alabama this year began using nitrogen gas to carry out some death sentences, the first use of a new execution method in the United States since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Alabama maintains the method is constitutional. But critics \u2014   citing how the first two people executed shook for several minutes \u2014   say the method needs more scrutiny, particularly if other states follow Alabama's path and adopt the new execution method.",
      "Deblieux's mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb. 26, 1994. Prosecutors said Deblieux was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother's home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They threw her off a cliff and later returned to mutilate her body.",
      "A medical examiner testified that Deblieux's face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Her fingers had also been severed. Investigators said the four teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend a severed finger and boasted about the killing.",
      "Grayson is the only one of the four facing a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19. Two of the teens were initially sentenced to death but had those sentences set aside when the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Another teen involved in Deblieux's killing was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Grayson's final appeals focused on the call for more scrutiny of the new execution method. They argued that the person experiences \"conscious suffocation\" and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state promised. Attorneys for Grayson asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to give time to weigh the constitutionality of the method.",
      "\"Given this is the first new execution method used in the United States since lethal injection was first used in 1982, it is appropriate for this Court to reach the issues surrounding this novel method,\" Grayson's attorneys wrote.",
      "Lawyers for the Alabama attorney general's office asked justices to let the execution go forward, saying a lower court found Grayson's claims speculative.",
      "The state lawyers wrote that Alabama's \"nitrogen hypoxia protocol has been successfully used twice, and both times it resulted in a death within a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Kenny Smith was\u00a0the first person to die by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0earlier this year, drawing international outcry.",
      "Alan Eugene Miller\u00a0was the second. He was executed by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0last month.",
      "Alabama had been accused of\u00a0botching\u00a0an execution attempt using lethal injection, the default method of putting inmates to death.",

    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",

      "Hegseth, a former Fox News host and President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be defense secretary, told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing, the report said.",
      "News of the allegations surfaced last week when local officials released a brief statement confirming that a woman had accused Hegseth of sexual assault in October 2017 after he had spoken at a Republican women's event in Monterey.",
      "Hegseth's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday.",
      "The 22-page police report, obtained by Mediaite, CBS News and other news outlets, was released in response to a public records request and offers the first detailed account of what the woman alleged transpired \u2014 one that is at odds with Hegseth's version of events.",
      "The report cited police interviews with the alleged victim, a nurse who treated her, a hotel staffer, another woman at the event and Hegseth.",
      "The woman's name wasn't released, and CBS News and The Associated Press don't typically name people who say they've been sexually assaulted.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said early Thursday that the \"report corroborates what Mr. Hegseth's attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false.\"",
      "Police recommended the case report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review.",
      "Investigators were first alerted to the alleged assault, the report said, by a nurse who called them after a patient requested a sexual assault exam. The patient told medical personnel she believed she was assaulted five days earlier but couldn't remember much about what had happened. She reported something may have been slipped into her drink before ending up in the hotel room where she said the assault occurred.",
      "Police collected the unwashed dress and underwear she had worn that night, the report said.",
      "The woman's partner, who was staying at the hotel with her, told police that he was worried about her that night after she didn't come back to their room. At 2 a.m., he went to the hotel bar, but she wasn't there. She made it back a few hours later, apologizing that she \"must have fallen asleep.\" A few days later, she told him she had been sexually assaulted.",
      "The woman told police she had witnessed the TV anchor acting inappropriately throughout the night and saw him stroking women's legs. She texted a friend that Hegseth was giving off a \"creeper\" vibe, according to the report.",
      "After the event, the woman and others attended an afterparty in a hotel suite where she said she confronted Hegseth, telling him she \"did not appreciate how he treated women,\" the report states.",
      "A group of people, including Hegseth and the woman, left for the hotel's bar. That's when \"things got fuzzy,\" the woman told police.",
      "She remembered having a drink at the bar with Hegseth and others, the police report states. She also told police she argued with Hegseth near the hotel pool, an account supported by a hotel staffer who was sent to handle the disturbance and spoke to police, according to the report.",
      "Soon, the accuser told police, she was inside a hotel room with Hegseth and he took her phone and blocked the door with his body so she couldn't leave, according to the report. She also told police she remembered \"saying 'no' a lot,\" the report said.",
      "Her next memory was laying on a couch or bed with Hegseth hovering over her bare-chested, his dog tags dangling over her, the report states. Hegseth served in the National Guard, rising to the rank of major.",
      "After she said Hegseth ejaculated on her stomach, she recalled him asking if she was \"OK,\" the report states. She told police she did not recall how she got back to her own hotel room and had since suffered from nightmares and memory loss.",
      "At the time of the alleged assault in 2017, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records.",
      "Hegseth told police that he attended an after party and drank beer but didn't consume \"hard alcohol\" and acknowledged being \"buzzed\" but not drunk, according to the police report.",
      "He said he met the woman at the hotel bar and she led him by the arm back to his hotel room, which surprised him because he initially had no intention of having sex with her, the report said.",
      "Hegseth told investigators the sexual encounter that followed was consensual, adding that he explicitly asked more than once if she was comfortable. Hegseth said in the morning the woman \"showed early signs of regret\" and he assured her that he wouldn't tell anyone about the encounter.",

      "Still, how exactly the military would be tapped to carry out this promise of mass deportations is unclear. And there are untested legal questions about involving service members in immigration enforcement operations.",
      "The Department of Defense has provided operational support to immigration and border authorities for decades, under both Republican and Democratic presidents. Roughly 4,000 service members \u2013 primarily from the National Guard \u2014 are currently authorized to support the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) security mission along the southwest border, according to the U.S. Northern Command.",
      "While longstanding federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement \u2014 which includes immigration arrests and deportations \u2014 a few rarely invoked statutory exceptions exist.",
      "The Department of Defense's vast funding and resources could be instrumental in helping the incoming administration address the operational and financial challenges of carrying out deportations on a monumental scale. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch has a fraction of the resources that would be necessary, with 6,000 agents and 41,000 detention beds. About 11 million immigrants are estimated to be living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "What have Trump and his allies said about using the military for deportations?",
      "In an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Tom Homan, who Trump has appointed to be his \"border czar,\" indicated that one way to increase manpower for the mass deportation plan would be to re-hire retired ICE agents. Contractors, he added, could do some of the operational work, including handling transportation and setting up so-called \"soft-sided\" facilities, or tent detention sites, to hold migrant detainees.",
      "Homan said transportation and supply assets from the Department of Defense would also be helpful, suggesting that military planes could be used for deportation. But Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, has gone further than Homan, suggesting the National Guard could be deputized to arrest undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller said during a radio interview last year. \"They know their states, they know their communities, they know their cities.\"",
      "And while U.S. law generally bans the use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement, during an interview with the New York Times last year, Miller said a revamped Trump administration would invoke what's known as the Insurrection Act to create an exception, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants.",
      "The military, Miller has also indicated, could be dispatched to the southern border with \"an impedance and denial mission.\"",
      "\"You reassert the fundamental constitutional principle that you don't have the right to enter into our sovereign territory, to even request an asylum claim,\" Miller said at this year's CPAC. \"The military has the right to establish a fortress position on the border to say no one can cross here at all.\"",
      "Finally, Trump has pledged to use the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law invoked during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German, Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members.",
      "How could the military be deployed to the U.S. border?",
      "The U.S. military's role at the U.S.-Mexico border dates back to the Mexican American War, with additional buildup of troops at the southern border during the Mexican Revolution and World War I.",
      "\"For basically the past 40 years, the military's involvement at the border has been steadily growing,\" said Joseph Nunn, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, \"And it has gone from sort of ad hoc to routine to deeply entrenched into how we approach border security and immigration.\"",
      "Members of the military stationed at the border have historically performed an array of support tasks, experts tell CBS News \u2013 from operating surveillance aircrafts and transporting U.S. Border Patrol personnel in helicopters to laying concertina wire and maintaining Customs and Border Protection vehicles.",
      "Homan's suggestions of using the military for some of the operational work that doesn't involve engaging with migrants would fall under this category and would be an expansion of the duties National Guard and a small number of active-duty troops have performed at the southern border under previous administrations. As recently as last year, troops were deployed to the border to help Border Patrol with administrative tasks, like warehouse management and clerical work.",
      "Military involvement now \"is just essentially to get access to more bodies and more aircrafts,\" Nunn explained, calling military mobilization a force multiplier. \"Suppose you want to set up a checkpoint on a highway in Texas or Arizona. Under normal circumstances, you need five CBP agents to run a checkpoint. If you have access to military personnel, you can run a checkpoint with one CBP agent assisted by four soldiers. Then suddenly five CBP agents assisted by soldiers can run five checkpoints instead of one.\"",
      "\"[The Trump administration] would also use the military to do things like build bases and facilities to hold people,\" senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, Thomas Warrick, told CBS News. \"He could use the military to fly detainees around the country or indeed to deport them to other countries if they can get landing rights.\"",
      "Can the U.S. military act as domestic law enforcement?",
      "Using the military in an active law enforcement role, rather than in a support capacity, would be more complex and unusual, but subject to at least one legal loophole.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act bars federal armed forces from participating in law enforcement activities unless expressly authorized by Congress. But the 1807 Insurrection Act, which Miller mentioned, allows the president to utilize the military in domestic cases that warrant it. While the National Guard is under state control and not activated for federal service, it is not subject to Posse Comitatus.",
      "Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War, and in the 20th century, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on the law to desegregate schools, deploying troops to the South after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The most recent time it was used was in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush after both city and state leaders asked for federal help to quell the L.A. riots.",
      "According to the law, the military may be activated to enforce the laws on U.S. soil or to \"suppress rebellion\" whenever \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" make it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal law in that state by the \"ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Can this be challenged in court?",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said using the military to carry out deportations under the Alien and Sedition Acts would be \"patently unlawful,\" because current circumstances don't allow for it.",
      "\"The law requires an invasion by a foreign government,\" said Gelernt, who challenged many of the first Trump administration's immigration policies. \"That's not what is happening with immigration.\"",
      "There is already an agency, ICE, that enforces immigration laws with arrest authority that the U.S. military does not have.",
      "\"It was designed for unexpected emergencies,\" Nunn said, but added that, \"its text grants vast discretion to the president\" with \"no meaningful criteria\" to justify invoking it.",
      "In 1827, the Supreme Court ruled in Martin v. Mott that the president has the sole authority to decide whether a situation warrants deploying the military. However, \"If you can prove that the president has invoked the insurrection act in bad faith, which is going to be a high bar to clear but not impossible, you could potentially challenge the decision to invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn explained, adding that the centuries-old law does not permit the military to violate constitutional rights or to violate otherwise applicable federal law.",
      "Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University who focuses on civil military relations, said using the military as law enforcement would be controversial and could degrade trust in the military, even if there is a legal case for it.",
      "\"This is not what the military trains for, but on top of all of that, it would be deeply politically polarizing because there'd be many many Americans who would view this as an inappropriate mission, a betrayal of our American values or something,\" said Feaver, who has written a book called \"Thanks for Your Service: The Causes and Consequences of Public Confidence in the US Military.\"",
      "Congress has no role in invoking the Insurrection Act. In July, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, renewed his legislative push to overhaul the law. He first introduced a bill reforming the Insurrection Act in 2020, after Trump's threats to use troops to respond to civil rights protests across the U.S. following the police killing of George Floyd, but his efforts were stalled by Republican opposition and pushback from the Trump administration.",
      "What if Trump declared a national emergency at the border?",
      "Trump declared a national emergency at the border during his first administration, after Congress declined to fund border wall construction. He used the declaration to unilaterally divert Pentagon funds to expand the border wall.",
      "\"The Pentagon budget \u2013 that's where the money is,\" Warrick said. \"It's where the people are. It's where the aircrafts are.\"",
      "The long-term cost of deporting 1 million people per year could average $88 billion annually, according to the American Immigration Council, surpassing the Department of Homeland Security's $62 billion budget in fiscal year 2025 and totalling nearly $968 billion over a decade. The operation would also demand lightning-speed expansion of the immigration court systems and detention facilities.",
      "\"It's going to be astronomically expensive,\" Nunn said. \"And not only is it going to be straightforwardly expensive, but it's also going to come with opportunity costs \u2014 every military service member and military asset that is diverted to assist with a mass deportation program or to assist with border security is a service member or asset that is not carrying out their normal duties.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their \"biological sex.\" Her proposal claims that allowing \"biological males\" into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement Wednesday that single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House office buildings, like restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, \"are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\" He noted that each member's office has a private restroom and said there are unisex restrooms throughout the Capitol.",
      "\"Women deserve women's only spaces,\" he said.",
      "McBride said she will follow the rules outlined by Johnson \"even if I disagree with them.\"",
      "\"This effort to distract from the real issues facing this country hasn't distracted me over the last several days, as I've remained hard at work preparing to represent the greatest state in the union come January,\" she said in a statement shared to social media.",
      "Johnson's statement came on Transgender Day of Remembrance, which is observed on Nov. 20 and honors transgender people who have died from violence. He acknowledged Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",
      "He declined to say whether he plans to include Mace's proposal in a package of rules that will govern the next Congress.",
      "\"We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that I've pursued my whole life,\" he said. \"And we will take care of this issue of first impression for Congress as we will any other thing. We'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress.\"",
      "Johnson later sought to clarify his response about whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman,\" he said. \"That said, I also believe \u2014 that's what Scripture teaches, what I just said \u2014 but I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.\"",
      "House Democrats condemned Mace's resolution and accused her of bullying a fellow member of Congress.",
      "\"This is what we're doing? This is the lesson that you've drawn from the election in November? This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people?\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, called the proposal \"disgusting\" and said, \"I was sick to my stomach when I read that.\"",
      "Mace, meanwhile, claimed that she is being targeted and vowed to introduce new legislation that focuses on protecting \"women and girls everywhere.\" She said if Johnson does not include her resolution in the package of rules for the new Congress, she would seek to amend it or force a vote on her measure.",

      "The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with controversial anti-personnel mines in its war against Russia, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News Tuesday night.",
      "Anti-personnel mines, or APLs, are designed to be used against people, not vehicles. They can be rapidly deployed and are meant to blunt the advances of ground forces, making them useful for Ukraine's defense against Russia's advances in Eastern Ukraine, the official said.",
      "The U.S. sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use to further limit the risk to civilians, the official said, noting that Ukrainians are committed to not employing the mines in areas populated with their own civilians.",
      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",

      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",
      "\"Typically, several hundred of these at a time will just be liberally and indiscriminately spread across the territory,\" Pete Smith, the Ukraine program manager for the HALO Trust, a nonprofit organization focused on ridding warzones of landmines, told \"60 Minutes\" in August. \"They can rest on the roofs. They can sit in guttering. They can take years before they come back into society and into view.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to shore up support for his nomination for attorney general amid calls for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz sat down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection for attorney general.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune met with Gaetz on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "Gaetz and Vance also met with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. The seven sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct Gaetz's confirmation hearings early next year. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also met with Gaetz and Vance on Wednesday.",
      "Hawley told CBS News that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to get a confirmation hearing and ensure that Gaetz gets an opportunity \"to respond in public, under oath.\" Hawley outlined that he thinks Gaetz has talked to every member of the Judiciary Committee and many other senators who do not sit on the committee. He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",
      "\"I fear the process surrounding the Gaetz nomination is turning into an angry mob, and unverified allegations are being treated as if they are true. I have seen this movie before,\" he said, an apparent reference to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018. \"I would urge all of my Senate colleagues, particularly Republicans, not to join the lynch mob and give the process a chance to move forward.\"",
      "Lee, speaking with reporters following his meeting with Gaetz, said Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings should be a \"warning\" amid the allegations against the Florida Republican.",
      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Ten of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked FBI Director Chris Wray to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "\"The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is crucial that we review all the information necessary to fulfill this duty as we consider Mr. Gaetz's nomination,\" the Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Wray. \"The grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Rep. Susan Wild said there was \"no consensus\" on the issue and the committee agreed to reconvene on Dec. 5.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee, meeting to consider the release of a report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, did not reach an agreement on Wednesday afternoon, the committee chairman said.",
      "The meeting came one week after the Florida Republican resigned from Congress following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to select him for attorney general.",
      "House Ethics Committee chairman Michael Guest told reporters that the panel had not reached an \"agreement to release the report\" as he exited the meeting Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Guest told CBS News that he voted against the release of the report, saying \"the committee no longer has jurisdiction on the issue so I disagreed with the release of the information.\"",
      "The committee's other members did not comment on the more than two-hour meeting as they exited.",
      "Rep. Susan Wild, the ranking Democrat on the committee, addressed reporters after Guest's comments, saying the committee members had agreed not to discuss what transpired at the meeting. She said Guest had \"betrayed the process\" by disclosing the deliberations, expressing frustration at the implication that there was unanimity among the panel.",
      "Wild said the idea that the committee had reached an agreement not to move forward was \"untrue.\" She noted that in order to move something forward in the evenly divided committee, a member has to cross party lines and vote with the other side.",
      "\"There was no consensus on this issue,\" she continued. \"We did agree that we would reconvene as a committee on Dec. 5 to further consider this matter.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance met Wednesday with a number of Senate Republicans in the Capitol as they look to shore up support for his nomination. When asked by reporters Wednesday evening  for his reaction to the developments from the Ethics Committee, Gaetz said he wasn't paying much attention to the panel.",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I've been focused on what we got to do to reform the Department of Justice,\" Gaetz said. \"I have been meeting with senators. I haven't been paying much attention to that.\"",
      "Gaetz said he was looking forward to his confirmation hearing in the Senate.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune also met with Gaetz Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said that the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "The House Ethics Committee, which is made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. The investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after the DOJ declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The panel has faced growing pressure to release the potentially damaging report following Trump's announcement, as the Senate gears up for a fight over the president-elect's most controversial Cabinet picks seeking confirmation. Before the move, the committee had planned to meet Friday for a vote on whether to release the report, sources told CBS News. But Gaetz's resignation from the House ended the committee's jurisdiction, complicating the path forward since normally reports on former members are not released.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson himself urged the committee not to release the report, warning last week of the \"terrible precedent\" the move would set, opening \"Pandora's box.\" But the committee's top Democrat has advocated for the report to be released, while senators on both sides of the aisle have pushed for it to be made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee as the chamber looks to exercise its advice and consent role over Trump's Cabinet selections. On Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also sent a letter to the FBI requesting Gaetz's complete evidentiary file related to the investigation into alleged sex trafficking of minors.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said as part of its investigation, it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. It noted that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, including claims of sexual misconduct, drug use and obstructing government investigations into his conduct, among others.",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the committee told CBS News that the women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and noted that Venmo transactions related to the encounters had been obtained by the panel. One of the attorney's clients testified that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old during a July 2017 party.",
      "The Ethics Committee's move on Wednesday comes as Senate Republicans, who flipped the upper chamber in the 2024 elections, are set to hold a narrow majority in the new Congress, bolstering Trump's agenda and likely helping to streamline confirmation of his administration and judicial nominees. But their majority is a narrow one, putting the fate of Trump's more controversial picks \u2014 such as Gaetz \u2014 up in the air.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection of Gaetz for attorney general.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Martin O'Malley and Ken Martin have both jumped in the race for DNC chair, while others are exploring runs.",
    "story": [
      "Two candidates have officially launched their campaign to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, kicking off the race to determine who will lead the party's recovery after widespread losses in 2024.",
      "Martin O'Malley, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor, became the first notable figure to jump into the race on Monday. Ken Martin, who is the chair of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic party, and a DNC vice chair, announced his campaign Tuesday morning.",
      "Democrats are sifting through the fallout of the 2024 presidential election, where they not only lost the White House and control of the Senate but also failed to win back control of the House. The party finds itself without a clear leader and unified vision for the future, representing both a hurdle for the next DNC chair but also an opportunity to overhaul Democrats' approach with voters across the country in the coming years.",
      "Whoever the party's over 440 members elect to lead the party's national committee will be in charge of the party's top-level infrastructure, organizing and fundraising. And while DNC members tell CBS News that the eventual chair won't determine the widespread policy of the party, that person will serve as a notable mouthpiece to help craft the Democratic message.",
      "While the party itself was locked out of federal control after the elections, fundraising remained strong. As a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris raked in over $1 billion within the few months she was in the race. Her sum includes money raised by the DNC.",
      "Jamie Harrison, the current DNC chair, has said he would not seek reelection.",
      "The timeline for the election is not yet determined, though it will be addressed in a DNC Rules & Bylaws committee meeting on Dec. 12. DNC members expect the election itself to take place at their widespread member meeting before early spring 2025.",
      "In their launches, O'Malley and Martin both said prioritizing the party's message on the economy is essential. The state of the economy was a big issue that bolstered President-elect Donald Trump's return to office, according to a CBS News exit poll.",
      "\"When I'm traveling around the country, most people I chat with want the same things: to stay ahead on their bills, to give their families a better life and to live in safe and healthy communities. That's exactly what Democrats stand for, but we need to reconnect our ideas,\" Martin said in his campaign video.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Sen-elect Ruben Gallego's campaign, told CBS News he is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair and has fielded calls from a handful of DNC members and nonprofits.",
      "Rocha said he's still waiting to see how the field develops before jumping in, and \"if there's a better candidate that really stands for what I want to see done with the party.\"",
      "But Rocha has set several action items he would take as chair: eliminate education requirements for senior DNC positions, mandating that state parties \"be more inclusive\" and diverse with consultant hiring, and to focus on building party infrastructure in all 50 states.",
      "Asked about Martin's and O'Malley's campaigns, Rocha called them \"names that are from the institution.\"",
      "\"I think we need somebody from the outside and a strategist to come in and rebuild the party,\" said Rocha, who noted that his non-college background and upbringing in East Texas could be an advantage as the party looks to reconnect with working-class voters.",
      "Other names that could potentially run include Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair according to a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "Rahm Emanuel, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor, is also mulling over a run according to Axios. But potentially choosing Emanuel, a polarizing figure in the Democratic party, has been panned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups.",
      "Martin, a DNC member since he became a state party chair in 2011, may be the early favorite. Alan Clendenin, an executive DNC board member who is already supporting Martin, said he has \"a lot of friends in the DNC\" and pointed to relationships built from his time as President of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC). Clendenin said Martin already has support from just under 100 DNC committee members.",
      "\"The party is in a place where we have to have someone who has a really solid understanding of existing party infrastructure. What's there, what's not there. People who have walked the walk. Talked the talk. People who have had to deal with the frustration of what's lacking and be able to understand what it takes to turn things around,\" Clendenin said about Martin and the chair position.",
      "Democrats' lack of success in 2024 could linger over any of the candidates in the race. While Minnesota has been a reliably blue state under Martin's watch, it's not seen as a presidential battleground state. But if Democrats wanted to gravitate towards someone from any of the seven presidential battlegrounds, the fact that the Harris-Walz ticket lost every one of them may prove to be a hindrance for a party incredibly eager to avoid a repeat performance in 2028.",
      "\"We just need to win,\" said one DNC member about the stakes of the chair race. \"We need to know who's coming with the game plan to make it happen\u2026 We don't make policy. We win elections, and we win presidential elections. That's our priority.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:46:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Conspiracies persist, although it is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "We just had another election with a clear and verifiable victor, overseen by hundreds of thousands of election officials. Those public servants have suffered years of harassment, and despite their successes, are still being accused of taking part in a massive and impossible conspiracy \u2014 a conspiracy led by the party out of power to steal an election and cover up all evidence.",
      "Despite all evidence, many still believe that the opposition Democrats secretly overwhelmed the power of the Trump administration in 2020 to steal an election by 7 million popular votes and 70 electoral votes. And they believe that the Biden administration suddenly lost this mythical election-stealing power while controlling the executive branch in 2024.",
      "Within hours of President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump's projected victory in the 2024 election, conspiracy theories began to spread among those who opposed him. On the left, there were claims that \"the math just didn't add up,\" that 20 million ballots were \"missing\" or that Elon Musk's Starlink was uploading fake votes to help Trump. There was mischaracterization about why voters might split their votes between Trump and a Democrat.",
      "On the right, from those who supported Trump came claims that the \"20 million missing ballots\" were actually proof that the 2020 election had been stolen and that there was no possible way that President Biden could have received 81 million votes that year.",
      "For those who work in elections, and particularly the election officials around the country \u2014 public servants of both parties \u2014 these claims are familiar, and exhausting. And to be clear, these claims are false on their face.",
      "Millions of ballots weren't missing \u2013 they were being counted, and when the election is officially certified, we will confirm that the 2024 election saw only slightly lower turnout than 2020's all-time record. For those questioning \"missing votes,\" the 2024 election will end up seeing the second-largest number of ballots cast in any American election, and the second-highest turnout in any election in over 100 years, behind only 2020's record turnout.",
      "As for split votes, that happens all the time. Sometimes, as in 2020, there are a large number of voters who dislike both presidential candidates and choose to leave that race blank on their ballots. Sometimes, as in 2024, a significant number of people vote only for president, and leave the rest of their ballots blank. This is normal. Republicans in Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin didn't game the system to give Trump a win this year while allowing Democratic senators to win in each of those states. Democrats in 2020 didn't rig the system to defeat Trump that year, only to then give up key seats in state legislatures right before redistricting that would decide control of Congress. And we have the paper ballots that confirm this.",
      "And those paper ballots are the key. Trump won in 2024 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. Hand audits of those ballots are nearly complete and will confirm the results.",
      "Similarly, Mr. Biden won in 2020 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% audited paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. The math adds up because the ballots add up, and the election officials have shown their work.",
      "We know who won the last two presidential elections, thanks to the paper ballots, audits, and more election litigation and court review than any election in world history. In dozens of court cases, losing candidates couldn't produce a single piece of evidence that raised any question about the 2020 election outcome.",
      "When Rudy Giuliani and Kari Lake were sued for defamation about their false claims, they could have defended themselves with evidence that they were speaking the truth. Instead, they conceded liability (Giuliani's assets have begun to be seized, and Lake just settled her case this past weekend). Fox News settled its defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, rather than attempt to present evidence of the truth of its claims. A group of esteemed conservative legal scholars further confirmed the 2020 election was \"Lost, not Stolen.\"",
      "But whether coming from the right or the left, the conspiracies continue, and our nation's election officials are concerned about the lasting damage. Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's office told me, \"Ideas that Musk's Starlink or black box voting might change votes plant seeds that will germinate into deeper conspiracy theories, and then further undermine faith in elections and institutions.\"",
      "Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates confirmed, \"People who push conspiracy theories without basis that tabulation machines have been breached or that dead people have voted by the thousands do harm to our democracy, regardless of whether the allegations come from the right, left or the middle of the political spectrum.\"",
      "Our elections are incredibly decentralized, with nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions nationwide, varying in technologies and processes. Our process is run by hundreds of thousands of election officials nationwide, of both parties. Every voter registration requires ID under federal law, and our voter records are as accurate as ever. In the exceedingly rare cases where fraud is attempted, it is caught and prosecuted. It is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
      "But foreign adversaries and domestic grifters understand how to exploit concerns about the security of American elections. They have employed a more effective strategy, to convince us against all evidence that our elections are being stolen. They have become masters at leveraging the losing side's disappointment at the outcome to create a fantasy world of election denial and to stoke fear, anger and hate directed at our fellow citizens, including our public servants. We saw on Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0how this anger can lead to violence.",
      "Entertaining these delusions could threaten our agency as voters. Worse, our susceptibility to these false claims aids U.S. adversaries, and puts public servants at risk. If we become a nation where both parties can only accept the integrity of our election system when they win, we are truly lost as a democracy.",

      "The president's picks to carry out his agenda reflect an incoming administration hostile to the norms of the \"Me Too\" movement. Behavior that might have gotten a person fired or canceled (or not nominated to a cabinet position) over the last several years, appears to be less problematic in the Trump 2.0 era.",
      "To be clear: three of the men \u2014 Gaetz, Hegseth and Musk \u2014 have consistently denied the allegations against them.",
      "Gaetz, Trump's attorney general pick, said he did not have a sexual relationship with a minor, a 17-year-old, while he was a member of Congress, despite sworn witness testimony to the contrary. Gaetz allies also point to a Justice Department investigation that yielded no charges.",
      "A 2017 sexual assault investigation into the man Trump plans to nominate to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, resulted in no charges, according to Hegseth's lawyer. Hegseth reached a confidential settlement with the woman involved.",
      "Eight employees of SpaceX filed a lawsuit earlier this year accusing CEO Elon Musk of fostering a hostile work environment that the plaintiffs say was rife with sexual harassment. The eight plaintiffs said that during the course of their employment with SpaceX, they were exposed to \"unwanted conduct and comments of a sexual nature by Elon Musk that created a hostile and abusive work environment,\" their lawsuit said. Musk denied the allegations, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. Musk has been tapped to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a government agency Trump intends to establish.",
      "Kennedy, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is the only one of the four who indicated it was possible that he had acted inappropriately, apologizing to a former nanny for allegations of unwanted sexual advances in the 1990s.",
      "He told CBS News that he does not recall the conduct in question, but does not want to \"leave anybody in the world feeling like I did something that was insensitive or inappropriate.\"",
      "Asked whether he might have to make a similar apology to someone else in the future, Kennedy replied, \"It's quite possible. I'm 70 years old. I had a very rambunctious life.\"",
      "Trump himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 15 women. In 2023, a jury found him civilly liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "The Trump transition team has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Machismo was often a centerpiece of Trump's appeal to voters during the 2024 campaign. He regularly spoke about toughness \u2014 whether that trait applied to his immigration policy, combating illicit drug trade or surviving two assassination attempts.",

He had a bigger advantage among male voters against Kamala Harris, winning this group by 13 percentage points, compared to the 8-point advantage he had against President Biden in 2020, and the 11-point margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016.",
      "The Senate will have final say on whether Gaetz, Hegseth and Kennedy become confirmed cabinet secretaries. Ahead of their confirmation hearings, Republican senators, who are likely to have to provide nearly all of the votes for these four nominees, did not say much about their prospects.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

      "The \"GOFAST\" video was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the East coast of the U.S. and made public in 2017.",
      "Former F/A-18 pilot Ryan Graves, who has spoken with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" about UAP sightings and later founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NBC News Now in an interview after the hearing that the Pentagon should continue to investigate the GOFAST case.",
      "\"I would argue that some of these cases aren't quote unquote debunked or no longer of interest, specifically the GOFAST video itself was never really interesting because it was going fast,\" Graves said. \"The pilots certainly didn't say that, nor did they name the video. If anything, the Pentagon simply debunked their own naming for that video.\"",
      "Graves also said there were more objects in the air at the time than the one depicted in the GOFAST video. The Pentagon is still investigating another video nicknamed GIMBAL that was taken around the time of the GOFAST video.",
      "After providing examples to Congress of two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls \"The Puerto Rico Objects\" and \"Mt. Etna,\" Kosloski described cases his office is still actively investigating, notably, an \"orange orb\" and \"a metallic cylinder.\"",
      "These cases are likely part of the 21 cases that the recently released annual unidentified aerial phenomena report said contain enough information and data for the office to actively investigate.",
      "One case was reported by a law enforcement officer \"out West\" who observed \"a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the ground,\" according to Kosloski.",
      "As the officer approached where he thought the orb would be, he saw \"a blacker than black object\" that was about the size of a Prius. When he reached a distance of 40-60 meters away from the object, it tilted 45 degrees and shot up vertically, traveling faster than any drone he had seen before.",
      "Just as it left his field of view, it emitted bright red and blue lights that lit up the inside of his vehicle \"as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside of his vehicle,\" Kosloski told Congress.",
      "Another case was reported from the southeastern part of the United States after two cars driven by government contractors left a facility around 9 a.m. and saw \"a large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane.\"",
      "After they observed it for 15-20 seconds, it disappeared.",
      "\"Obviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it's a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can't explain how that would happen,\" Kosloski said.",

Since then, Trump won the presidential election and will be headed to the White House in January.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An \"unknown and unauthorized third party\" has gained access to two dozen depositions of witnesses tied to the various investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, CBS News has learned.",
      "The leaked materials are part of a civil defamation case filed by Chris Dorworth, a lobbyist who is close to Gaetz. These materials include the sworn deposition of the minor with whom Gaetz allegedly had sex.",
      "According to a source familiar with the matter and an email viewed by CBS News, the person who gained access went by the name \"Altam Beezley.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0The New York Times first reported on the alleged leak.",
      "Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against him last year. The Ethics panel was looking into allegations the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. But Gaetz resigned his seat in the House last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected the Florida Republican to serve as his attorney general.",
      "Because Gaetz is no longer a House member, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him has ended.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came days before the ethics panel was set to convene to vote on whether to release a potentially damaging report detailing the findings of its investigation into the former congressman.",
      "The committee postponed the meeting, which was set for Friday, though two sources told CBS News that it is now set to gather Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against releasing the report on Gaetz, telling CNN on Sunday that the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.",
      "But some lawmakers, including in the Senate, have said the public should have access to it. Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that the panel's report should be made public and released to the Senate, which would vote after Trump takes office on whether to confirm Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "Wild said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats on the Ethics Committee to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the panel, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said \"certain allegations merit continued review\" after it issued more than two dozen subpoenas and spoke with more than a dozen witnesses. The panel said it was looking into claims Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "The former congressman has denied any wrongdoing and has called the ethics investigation a \"smear.\" Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the Ethics Committee told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed\u00a0 Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump's transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who was the Small Business Administration administrator in Trump's first administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "Lutnick has also donated millions to the effort to re-elect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump in August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Trump and his campaign worked to distance themselves from Project 2025 in the months leading up to Election Day, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals \"abysmal.\" Lutnick told CNBC he had read Project 2025 but had not met with any of its authors.",
      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump's orbit were calling on Trump to dump the previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \"Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\"",

    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",
      "The surgeons who saved Scalise at the hospital would credit Wenstrup with effective care at the shooting site, Scalise said.",
      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships. Some of his Democratic colleagues told CBS News that Wenstrup's departure will deprive the House of another of its more civil members.",
      "\"People will miss Brad up here, including me,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat told CBS News. \"He leads with his heart and cares about making things happen for the people he serves. I love the guy.\"",
      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The Senate has confirmed 217 of Mr. Biden's selections to serve on the federal bench and are aiming to approve more before Republicans take control.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Democrats work to push through President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts before he leaves office and control of the upper chamber flips, they are bumping up against efforts by their Republican colleagues to slow down the pace of confirmations, amid President-elect Donald Trump's urging that his party \"hold the line.\"",
      "Mr. Biden and Trump have made judicial nominations a priority in their respective terms in office, as courts become the arbiters of politically charged disputes over issues that affect all corners of American life.",
      "During his first term in office, the Senate confirmed 234 of Trump's judicial nominees to the Article III courts, which include the Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is fast approaching that number for his four years in office, with the Senate approving 217 of his candidates for the federal bench so far. There are 44 current vacancies, and 14 nominees awaiting action by the upper chamber, according to the Judicial Conference.",
      "Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but have encountered resistance from Republicans \u2014 who, egged on by Trump \u2014 looking to hold up and drag out the process.",
      "When the Senate convened for votes Monday, Republicans used procedural maneuvers to drag out the floor proceedings, slowing Democrats' efforts to confirm Mr. Biden's judicial picks. The plan to slow down the confirmations was orchestrated by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was elected last week to serve as the next GOP leader, according to Fox News.",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement.",
      "Trump is also pushing Senate Republicans to thwart Democrats' efforts to continue approving Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the courts with radical left judges on their way out the door,\" he wrote on social media. \"Republican senators need to show up and hold the line \u2014 no more judges confirmed before inauguration day!\"",
      "But Democrats are not breaking new ground by confirming Mr. Biden's judicial nominees during the lame-duck session. In 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the GOP-led Senate confirmed 19 candidates to the federal bench, including one judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and four to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
      "Among those who won approval in the weeks after the 2020 election was U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle, who at 33 years old was the youngest of Trump's nominees and was deemed \"not qualified\" to serve on the district court by the American Bar Association. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who tossed out the criminal case against Trump for his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents, was also confirmed by the Senate after the 2020 election.",
      "\"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2013 meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" Andrew Bates, White House spokesperson, said of the efforts to gum-up the confirmation process. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "Advocacy groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to continue to hold votes to approve all of the president's remaining nominees to the federal bench before Trump takes office in late January and Republicans claim the majority in the Senate.",
      "On Friday, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 141 groups sent a letter to senators urging them to confirm all pending judicial nominees, calling it \"urgent and enduring.\"",
      "\"We implore you to stay in and do this necessary work,\" the organizations said. \"It is essential that we leave no judges behind.\"",
      "Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, also launched a campaign aimed at pressuring senators to green-light Mr. Biden's picks for the federal courts.",
      "\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session to confirm the dozens of remaining fair-minded, qualified judges nominated by President Biden that the American people deserve,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice.",
      "Senate Democrats are unbowed by Republicans' efforts and have indicated they will charge ahead with confirming Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed Tuesday that Democrats \"are not done yet,\" and said his party will do what it can to \"get as many judges confirmed as we can.\"",
      "\"Everyone should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on nominations and get as many judges done as possible,\" the New York Democrat said, adding that Republicans \"can try dilatory tactics but we're going to persist, as we showed last night, as we're persisting now.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip who also chairs the Judiciary Committee, celebrated the judges brought forward by the committee over the last four years of Democratic control, noting that the vast majority of the judges that the Senate has considered are bipartisan, winning support from Republicans.",
      "But some Republicans didn't see them that way, such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who argued that many of Mr. Biden's nominees \"are not qualified to be on the federal bench\" and called them \"activists.\"",
      "Still, Senate Republicans acknowledge that they can't block the judicial picks across the board as Trump has requested. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, said that although Republicans would like to deliver on Trump's wishes, \"Democrats are in the majority, and even if we have all of our members here, we still can't prevent that, as long as they have all their members.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

    "summary": "Conservationists are teaming up with the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies to clear scorched land and make room for new reforestation projects.",
    "story": [
      "Medford, Oregon \u2014 In the heart of Southern Oregon's Fremont-Winema National Forest, crews are going to new heights to harvest a precious commodity.",
      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",
      "The demand for stock now requires all hands on deck. Logging companies like Collins Pine are helping the Forest Service source pine cones and clear scorched land for replanting.",
      "\"Fire and ecology and insects and disease \u2014 it doesn't care about a property line. So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",
      "Neighbors are helping neighbors in a program the Forest Service hopes to expand to other impacted states.",
      "When he looks at the seedlings, Kittler said he sees \"the forests that will be walked through by our children and our children's children.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

    "story": [
      "An endangered fin whale that washed up near a coastal trail in Alaska's largest city has attracted curious onlookers while biologists seek answers as to what caused the animal's death.",
      "The carcass found over the weekend near Anchorage was 47 feet (14.3 meters) long \u2014 comparable to the width of a college basketball court \u2014 and female, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologists.",
      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in\u00a0fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",
      "Daisy Grandlinard was among the parents who accompanied a group of children to see the whale Monday. As they drew closer, they could smell it, she said.",
      "\"It was really interesting for the kids to be able to feel it, touch the bottom because it kind of had tracks on it, like a sled almost. And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\" she said. \"We had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, 'Oh, that's what the baleen looks like in real life,' and 'Where is the blow hole?'\"",
      "Biologists hoped to complete their work Tuesday, untether the carcass and \"let the tide push it or move it,\" Mahoney said. \"Whatever it does or doesn't do \u2014 we don't know.\"",
      "According to NOAA, the whaling industry killed nearly 725,000 fin whales in the mid-1900's in the Southern Hemisphere alone. Today, the major threat to the species comes from vessel strikes.",
      "Other fin whales have washed ashore along the Western U.S. this year. In August, a large fin whale washed ashore in Southern California and died before rescuers could get to the scene, CBS Los Angeles reported. Officials said the whale, which was not fully grown, was believed to be in poor health due to visible bumps on its skin and a thin build.",
      "In February,\u00a0 a 46-foot-long whale was found washed up on an Oregon shore \u2014 emaciated, entangled and covered in what appears to be wounds from killer whales.",

    "story": [
      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump was on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",
      "The results were published Friday in the journal Science.",
      "China has launched several spacecraft to the moon. In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",

      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",

      "Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who is helping lead a Trump-sanctioned effort to get the new Department of Government Efficiency off the ground, claimed on his social media platform Thursday that he had \"just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock.\"",
      "Bezos clapped back. \"Nope. 100% not true,\" he responded\u00a0on X, the social media platform Musk owns. A representative for Bezos declined further comment, pointing to Bezos' post.",
      "Musk responded to Bezos, \"Well, then, I stand corrected,\" followed by a crying with laughter emoji.",
      "Musk ranks No. 1 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which pegs his net worth at $331 billion; Bezos is No. 2 on the list, with a net worth of $226 billion.",
      "In late October, the Bezos-owned Washington Post \u2014 which had been set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president \u2014 controversially broke from tradition by deciding that its opinion editors would\u00a0not support\u00a0a candidate.",
      "Although the Amazon founder defended the decision as a \"principled\" one, critics decried the move as an effort to avoid antagonizing Trump should he get elected. Famed former Washington Post editor Marty Baron blasted the decision as \"cowardice,\" while several prominent journalists at the paper quit. National Public Radio later reported that more than 200,000 WaPo readers had canceled their subscriptions.",
      "Since then, Trump's win has thrust Musk even more into the spotlight, with the technology entrepreneur working alongside businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to create a temporary agency charged with chopping wasteful federal spending.",
      "\"Not since the age of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate who greased FDR's ascent nearly a century ago, has a private citizen loomed so large over so many facets of American life at once, pulling the nation's culture, its media, its economy, and now its politics into the force field of his will,\" Time Magazine said in a feature story about Musk on Thursday. \"Standing beside him, even Trump can seem almost in awe, less of a boss than a companion to the man for whom this planet and its challenges are not big enough.\"",
      "Time also presented a checklist of what the publication described as Musk's career goals, from becoming the world's richest man and designing a brain chip implant to getting Trump elected. But Musk took issue with that framing.",
      "\"To be clear, I have not done any media interviews and this is not actually my checklist.   I am trying to make life multiplanetary to maximize the probable lifespan of consciousness,\" he said on social media.",

      "\"They still look like Elon Musk,\" she said. \"They still sound like Elon Musk.\"",
      "Deepfake scams on the rise in the U.S.",
      "As artificial intelligence technology evolves and becomes more accessible, these kinds of scams are becoming more common.",
      "According to Deloitte, a leading financial research group, AI-generated content contributed to more than $12 billion in fraud losses last year, and could reach $40 billion in the U.S. by 2027.",
      "Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau have issued warnings that deepfake scams are on the rise.",
      "A study by AI firm Sensity found that Elon Musk is the most common celebrity used in deepfake scams. One likely reason is his wealth and entrepreneurship. Another reason is because of the amount of interviews he's done; the more content there is of someone online, the easier it is to create convincing deepfakes.",
      "Anatomy of a deepfake",
      "At the University of North Texas in Denton, Professor Christopher Meerdo is also using artificial intelligence. But he's using it to create art.",
      "\"It's not going to replace the creative arts,\" Meerdo said. \"It's going to just augment them and change the way that we understand things that we could do in the sphere of creativity.\"",
      "Even though Meerdo sees artificial intelligence as a way to be innovative, he sees its dangers.",
      "Meerdo showed the CBS News Texas I-Team how scammers can take a real video and use AI tools to replace a person's voice and mouth movements, making them appear to say something completely different.",
      "Advances in technology are making it easier to create deepfake videos. All a person who's familiar with AI needs to make one is a single still image and a video recording.",
      "To demonstrate this, Meerdo took a video of investigative reporter Brian New to create a deepfake of Elon Musk.",
      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",
      "\"If you are really trying to scam people, I think you can do some really bad things with this,\" Meerdo said.",
      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",
      "Sensity",
      "Sensity's deepfake detector correctly identified all six clips, showing a heatmap indicating where A.I. manipulation is most likely.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "title": "Matt Gaetz withdraws as attorney general nominee",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:04:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his nominee to be attorney general last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz announced Thursday that he is withdrawing his nomination for attorney general.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to lead the Justice Department as the nation's top law enforcement officer last week. He swiftly resigned his seat in the House and was on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, meeting with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who would oversee his confirmation hearings.",
      "Gaetz said in a social media post that while he had \"excellent meetings\" with senators, his confirmation battle was taking away from the work of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" he wrote on social media. \"There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.\"",
      "He added, \"I remain fully committed to see that Donald J. Trump is the most successful President in history. I will forever be honored that President Trump nominated me to lead the Department of Justice and I'm certain he will Save America.\"",
      "In response to Gaetz's decision, Trump wrote on social media, \"I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect.\"",
      "He predicted Gaetz \"has a wonderful future.\" ahead.",
      "Gaetz called both Trump and Vance separately to inform them of his decision, CBS News confirmed.",
      "Gaetz's nomination was swiftly shrouded in controversy as he was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a \"smear.\" Gaetz blamed the probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose ouster Gaetz helped lead last year.",
      "The Justice Department also conducted an investigation into Gaetz involving allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Several senators expressed concerns about installing Gaetz as attorney general, raising doubts that he would win confirmation even with Republicans in control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins in January. Some then indicated that his decision to remove himself as the attorney general candidate was the right one.",
      "\"I think the decision to withdraw the nomination is the right decision to make,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said. He continued: \"I thought from the beginning, as I shared earlier, I thought it was problematic. And I think you know, as some of our members have expressed, as they've learned more about it, there was perhaps some information out there that the president was not aware of when he made the original recommendation.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota, said he is \"grateful\" Gaetz withdrew, while Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said \"there were a lot of red flags.\"",
      "\"I think that he has put country first, and I'm pleased with his decision,\" she said.",
      "It is the first major blow to Trump's efforts to fill his Cabinet and key administration posts for his second term in office. The president-elect's pick for secretary of defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, is also under scrutiny after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017. A police report provided details of the incident, which Hegseth said at the time was consensual. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came just two days before the Ethics Committee was set to meet to discuss whether to release a report detailing its years-long investigation into the Florida Republican. Because he stepped down from his position in the House upon his selection to lead the Justice Department, the committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz ended, raising questions about whether the panel's report would be released.",
      "The Ethics Committee did convene Wednesday and considered the report's release. But lawmakers said the panel, divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, did not reach agreement. The committee planned to reconvene on Dec. 5 \"to further consider this matter,\" Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters after the initial meeting.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it was looking into allegations against Gaetz of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts and giving \"special privileges and favors,\" and obstructing the investigations into his conduct. House investigators interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and issued 25 subpoenas, the committee said in a rare statement.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the committee that they had been paid to go to parties attended by Gaetz that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the Ethics Committee.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients\u00a0testified before the Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",
      "Leppard said following Gaetz's withdrawal that his \"clients are relieved to have this chapter behind them and eager to move forward with their lives. We're hopeful this brings final closure for all parties involved.\"",
      "Confirmation hearings for Gaetz before the Judiciary Committee would not have taken place until early next year, but Republican and Democratic senators have been pushing to see the Ethics Committee's report as they considered his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Guest, chairman of the Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's decision to pull himself from consideration ends his panel's involvement.",
      "\"I think that this should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter,\" he told reporters. \"He has withdrawn his nomination. He is no longer a member of Congress, and so I think that this settles any involvement that the Ethics Committee should have in any matters involving Mr. Gaetz.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have for years duked it out for the unofficial title of the world's richest person. Now, with Donald Trump heading back to the White House, they seem to be competing for who can win \u2014 or at least not lose \u2014 the president-elect's favor.",
      "Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who is helping lead a Trump-sanctioned effort to get the new Department of Government Efficiency off the ground, claimed on his social media platform Thursday that he had \"just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock.\"",
      "Bezos clapped back. \"Nope. 100% not true,\" he responded\u00a0on X, the social media platform Musk owns. A representative for Bezos declined further comment, pointing to Bezos' post.",
      "Musk responded to Bezos, \"Well, then, I stand corrected,\" followed by a crying with laughter emoji.",
      "Musk ranks No. 1 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which pegs his net worth at $331 billion; Bezos is No. 2 on the list, with a net worth of $226 billion.",
      "In late October, the Bezos-owned Washington Post \u2014 which had been set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president \u2014 controversially broke from tradition by deciding that its opinion editors would\u00a0not support\u00a0a candidate.",
      "Although the Amazon founder defended the decision as a \"principled\" one, critics decried the move as an effort to avoid antagonizing Trump should he get elected. Famed former Washington Post editor Marty Baron blasted the decision as \"cowardice,\" while several prominent journalists at the paper quit. National Public Radio later reported that more than 200,000 WaPo readers had canceled their subscriptions.",
      "Since then, Trump's win has thrust Musk even more into the spotlight, with the technology entrepreneur working alongside businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to create a temporary agency charged with chopping wasteful federal spending.",
      "\"Not since the age of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate who greased FDR's ascent nearly a century ago, has a private citizen loomed so large over so many facets of American life at once, pulling the nation's culture, its media, its economy, and now its politics into the force field of his will,\" Time Magazine said in a feature story about Musk on Thursday. \"Standing beside him, even Trump can seem almost in awe, less of a boss than a companion to the man for whom this planet and its challenges are not big enough.\"",
      "Time also presented a checklist of what the publication described as Musk's career goals, from becoming the world's richest man and designing a brain chip implant to getting Trump elected. But Musk took issue with that framing.",
      "\"To be clear, I have not done any media interviews and this is not actually my checklist.   I am trying to make life multiplanetary to maximize the probable lifespan of consciousness,\" he said on social media.",

    "story": [
      "One of the first tasks faced by an incoming president is staffing the Cabinet, the people who collectively are a president's top advisers and the nation's highest officials. Most of the members of this group need to be confirmed by the Senate in order to serve in the roles chosen for them by the president.",
      "Cabinet secretaries run the federal government's departments, serving as their public faces while overseeing implementation of the president's policies. In those roles, they provide counsel to the president on matters related to the departments they manage.",

      "Attorney general",
      "Trump announced on Nov. 13 that he'd nominate former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, but now he'll have to select another candidate. Eight days later, Gaetz withdrew from consideration amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into sexual misconduct and obstruction allegations against him.",

      "The attorney general gives legal advice and opinions to the president, as well as to the heads of other federal agencies, and represents the United States in legal matters generally. The attorney general also supervises law enforcement agencies that fall under the Justice Department's umbrella, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known as the ATF.",
      "Trump criticized the FBI for years, dating back to his first run for president, when the agency investigated alleged links between his associates and Russian officials, and after he left office, the FBI searched his residence in Florida for classified records he kept after his first term.",
      "The attorney general also has the power to appoint special counsels, lawyers who investigate \u2014 and prosecute \u2014 cases in which the Justice Department may have conflicts of interest. Trump has raged against the special counsels who investigated him during and after his first term in office.",
      "Agriculture secretary",
      "Trump has not yet announced who he'll nominate for agriculture secretary. The current secretary of agriculture is Tom Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa who held this Cabinet role twice, during Mr. Biden's administration, as well as under former President Barack Obama.",
      "As the head of the Agriculture Department, the agriculture secretary oversees an agency dedicated to farming and livestock food production, agricultural trade and production, food safety and the protection of natural resources. The U.S. Forest Service is the department's largest agency, responsible for 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands.",

      "If confirmed, Hegseth would lead 1.3 million active-duty service members, including soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, among a total of 3.4 million personnel worldwide. Hegseth would also be responsible for overseeing any use of the military on domestic soil. Trump said as recently as Monday that he plans to declare a national emergency and use the military to support a plan to conduct mass deportations of immigrants deemed to be in the country illegally.",
      "The secretary of defense is second only to the president in the military's chain of command. Hegseth would manage the Pentagon, craft national defense policy, and coordinate intelligence \u2014 via the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2014 with the National Security Council.",

      "This department is responsible for a broad range of domestic security concerns, with a mandate that includes anti-terrorism, border security and immigration, as well as disaster prevention and management. Trump made immigration and border issues the central focus of his campaign, and has promised to launch a mass deportation effort aimed at removing millions of people from the United States.",

      "The secretary of transportation oversees the nation's complex federal network of highways and railroads, as well as pipelines, aviation and trucking regulation. Duffy would take on the role at a precarious time, as East coast dockworkers are in stalled contract negotiations and nearing a possible strike in January.

      "A high-ranking Mexican cartel leader who faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" in California has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, U.S. officials said Thursday.",
      "Cristian Fernando Gutierrez-Ochoa was arrested in Riverside, California, on Tuesday, the Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "Gutierrez-Ochoa is the son-in-law of Nemesio Oseguera-Cervantes, 58, also known as \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which the officials described as \"one of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking organizations.\"",
      "Nicole Argentieri, a senior Justice Department official, said Gutierrez-Ochoa \"allegedly directed the importation of tons of methamphetamine and cocaine into the United States and engaged in violence to aid the cartel's criminal activities.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Gutierrez-Ochoa \"allegedly faked his own death and assumed a false identity to evade justice and live a life of luxury in California.\"",
      "According to court documents, Gutierrez-Ochoa began working for the Jalisco cartel in 2014 and coordinated the shipment of 40,000 kilograms (88,000 pounds) of methamphetamine and 2,000 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the United States.",

      "In December 2022, the Mexican army\u00a0captured Antonio Oseguera, the brother of \"El Mencho.\"\u00a0 He allegedly oversaw violent actions and logistics, and bought weapons and laundered money for the Jalisco cartel.

    "story": [
      "An Alabama prisoner convicted of the 1994 murder of a female hitchhiker is slated to become the third person executed in the U.S., and Alabama, by nitrogen gas on Thursday. The United States Supreme Court denied a final petition to halt the execution Thursday afternoon, paving the way for it to go ahead as planned.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama on her way to her mother's home in Louisiana. He is scheduled to be executed Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in south Alabama.",
      "Alabama this year began using nitrogen gas to carry out some death sentences, the first use of a new execution method in the United States since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Alabama maintains the method is constitutional. But critics \u2014   citing how the first two people executed shook for several minutes \u2014   say the method needs more scrutiny, particularly if other states follow Alabama's path and adopt the new execution method.",
      "Deblieux's mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb. 26, 1994. Prosecutors said Deblieux was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother's home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They threw her off a cliff and later returned to mutilate her body.",
      "A medical examiner testified that Deblieux's face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Her fingers had also been severed. Investigators said the four teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend a severed finger and boasted about the killing.",
      "Grayson is the only one of the four facing a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19. Two of the teens were initially sentenced to death but had those sentences set aside when the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Another teen involved in Deblieux's killing was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Grayson's final appeals focused on the call for more scrutiny of the new execution method. They argued that the person experiences \"conscious suffocation\" and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state promised. Attorneys for Grayson asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to give time to weigh the constitutionality of the method.",
      "\"Given this is the first new execution method used in the United States since lethal injection was first used in 1982, it is appropriate for this Court to reach the issues surrounding this novel method,\" Grayson's attorneys wrote.",
      "Lawyers for the Alabama attorney general's office asked justices to let the execution go forward, saying a lower court found Grayson's claims speculative.",
      "The state lawyers wrote that Alabama's \"nitrogen hypoxia protocol has been successfully used twice, and both times it resulted in a death within a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Kenny Smith was\u00a0the first person to die by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0earlier this year, drawing international outcry.",
      "Alan Eugene Miller\u00a0was the second. He was executed by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0last month.",
      "Alabama had been accused of\u00a0botching\u00a0an execution attempt using lethal injection, the default method of putting inmates to death.",

      "The father of a 14-year-old boy accused of carrying out a deadly mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the charges against him.",
      "Colin Gray was not in court, but his lawyers told the judge during a brief hearing that their client pleads not guilty and waived formal arraignment. It's common in Georgia for defendants to enter a plea and waive arraignment.",
      "Gray and his son, Colt Gray, were both indicted in the Sept. 4 shooting that killed two students and two teachers and injured others. Colt Gray is charged as an adult and was indicted on 55 counts, including murder and 25 counts of aggravated assault at the high school. His father was indicted on 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Both also face multiple counts of cruelty to children.",
      "Colt Gray entered a not guilty plea last month and also waived arraignment.",
      "Colt Gray is being held in a juvenile detention center in Gainesville, while Colin Gray, 54, is being held in the Barrow County jail. Neither has sought to be released on bail.",
      "The shooting killed teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire.",
      "Colin Gray is the first adult known to be charged in a school shooting in Georgia. His indictment is the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible for their children's actions in school shootings. Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley, the first to be convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting, were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son's deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.",
      "Investigators have said Colt Gray carried a semiautomatic assault-style rifle onto a school bus, with the barrel sticking out of his book bag, wrapped up in a poster board. They say the boy carefully plotted the shooting at the 1,900-student high school northeast of Atlanta, drawing diagrams and listing potential body counts in a notebook. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the rifle before shooting people in a classroom and hallways.",
      "Last month, authorities\u00a0revealed details from the alleged shooter's notebooks\u00a0that included detailed plans of the attack as well as violent drawings. Witnesses testified Colin Gray knew of his son's struggles with his mental health but purchased a laser sight, tactical vest and ammunition for him in the months leading up to the shooting.",
      "Investigators also said that the alleged shooter made a \"shrine\" to school shooters in his room, and hung a picture of the Parkland shooter, who killed 17 people at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. Their testimony revealed his father was aware of his obsession with school shooters, and that the teenager had even discussed the Parkland shooting with his grandmother around a week before the shooting.",

    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:44:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "story": [
      "Medford, Oregon \u2014 In the heart of Southern Oregon's Fremont-Winema National Forest, crews are going to new heights to harvest a precious commodity.",
      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",
      "The demand for stock now requires all hands on deck. Logging companies like Collins Pine are helping the Forest Service source pine cones and clear scorched land for replanting.",
      "\"Fire and ecology and insects and disease \u2014 it doesn't care about a property line. So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",

      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",

      "Online court records did not list a lawyer who could speak on Adani's behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of his conglomerate, the Adani Group.

    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office\u00a0said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists in Turkey say they have discovered an ancient amulet depicting a Biblical figure in a battle against the devil.",
      "The rare artifact was found during an ongoing excavation project in Hadrianopolis, an ancient city near Karab\u00fck, and dated to the fifth century.",
      "Hadrianopolis was used as a settlement during various periods of history, including during the Roman and Byzantine empires. Excavation and restoration work has been taking place there since 2003, with over a dozen buildings discovered and\u00a0multiple massive mosaics found over the years.",
      "The pendant, made of bronze, shows King Solomon, according to a news release issued by Turkey's Karab\u00fck University. The ancient ruler is seen riding a horse and holding a spear while defeating the devil, according to Dr. Ersin \u00c7elikba\u015f, an associate professor at the university. Solomon appears in multiple religions, including Judaism, Catholicism and Islam.",
      "\"The depiction of Prophet Solomon on this necklace surprised us and revealed the importance of the artifact for Anatolian archaeology,\" said \u00c7elikba\u015f. Anatolia is a region of Turkey.",
      "The phrase \"Our Lord defeated evil\" is written on one side of the amulet, and the names of four biblical angels \u2014 Azrail, Gabriel, Michael and Israfil \u2014 are written on the other side. The pendant would have been used as a charm to protect against evil or danger, \u00c7elikba\u015f told LiveScience.",
      "\u00c7elikba\u015f added that the amulet is related to the military nature of the city, noting that previous excavations had \"determined the existence of a cavalry unit\" in Hadrianopolis. This is the first pendant of its kind to be found in Turkey, \u00c7elikba\u015f said, though a similar piece was once found in Jerusalem.",
      "\"The presence of similar works in these two distant geographies indicates that Hadrianopolis was an important religious center in ancient times,\" \u00c7elikba\u015f said.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:11:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The leaders are accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes over the war in Gaza and the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.",
    "story": [
      "The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, whom Israel has\u00a0said was killed in an airstrike in July.",
      "Judges found there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that\" both Netanyahu and Gallant \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,\" when the ICC prosecutor filed applications for the arrest warrants, the ICC said in a statement Thursday.",
      "\"This finding is based on the role of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,\" the ICC said.",
      "Judges at the United Nations court \"found that their conduct led to the disruption of the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential goods to the population in need in Gaza. The aforementioned restrictions together with cutting off electricity and reducing fuel supply also had a severe impact on the availability of water in Gaza and the ability of hospitals to provide medical care.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas respond to ICC arrest warrants",
      "Israeli officials condemned the ICC prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May, and they were quick to lambast the issuing of the warrants on Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu's office issued a scathing statement dismissing the ICC as antisemitic and claiming its chief prosecutor had only sought the warrants in the first place to distract from sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "\"Israel rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions and charges against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a biased and discriminatory political body,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza... after the terrorist organization Hamas launched a murderous attack against it, committing the greatest massacre committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\"",
      "\"No anti-Israeli decision will prevent the State of Israel from protecting its citizens,\" the statement said, adding that Netanyahu himself would \"not give in to pressure, will not back down, and will not retreat until all the war goals that Israel set at the start of the campaign are achieved.\"",
      "Gallant, in a statement, said the court's decision had put Israel and \"the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimizes the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds. The decision sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.\"",
      "Deif, the commander of Hamas' military wing whom Israel says it killed over the summer, was accused by the ICC judges of being \"responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other forms of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence,\" in connection to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the ongoing war.",
      "About 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack and some 250 others taken hostage.",
      "Hamas has not confirmed or denied Deif's killing in a July Israeli airstrike.",
      "In a statement, Hamas called the ICC decision an \"important step towards justice for the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Making no mention of the warrant for Deif's arrest, Hamas said \"a message must be sent to every war criminal that he will not escape punishment regardless [of] how long it will take and no matter how much he tries to mislead people or distort the narrative, truth with prevail.\"",
      "What do the ICC arrest warrants mean practically?",
      "Theoretically, the arrest warrants could limit the movements of Netanyahu and Gallant, as any of the 124 member states where the court has jurisdiction would be obligated to arrest them. Deif, if he's still alive, would already have his movements restricted inside Gaza as Israel's military operations there continue.",
      "The ICC does not have a police force, so any arrest would be at the discretion of local law enforcement in member states. Israel and the United States are not signatories, so they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the court.",
      "The foreign minister of the Netherlands said the country was preparing to act on the warrants, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "In the U.S., Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said \"the Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.\"",
      "In a post on social media, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, whom\u00a0Trump has picked to serve as U.S. national security adviser, said the \"ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,\" adding a defense of Israel, which he said had \"lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Dnipro bears the brunt of Moscow's first retaliatory strike after Ukraine fires U.S.-made missiles into Russia, and Ukraine claims Moscow may have used an ICBM.",
    "story": [
      "Russia launched a barrage of missiles at Ukraine Thursday in its first major retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in the Russian region of Bryansk. That strike saw the Ukrainians use American-made and supplied long-range missiles known as ATACMS, which President Biden had given the Ukrainian forces permission to fire deeper into Russian territory only two days earlier.",
      "Moscow had warned the U.S. and its NATO allies for months against granting Ukraine permission to fire Western missiles into Russia, and Mr. Biden's weekend decision to permit such strikes drew stark new warnings from lawmakers and Russian media close to President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. was escalating the nearly three-year conflict at the risk of sparking a new world war.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have argued that it's Putin escalating the war he started by ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, including by deploying more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers to bolster his own forces in recent weeks. But there was little doubt that Moscow would respond to the Ukrainians' first use of the American ATACMS to strike inside Russia somehow, and air raid sirens blared across the country Wednesday as the U.S. closed its embassy in Kyiv and warned of a possible imminent \"significant air attack.\"",
      "The attack didn't come on Wednesday, but rather overnight, with Russian missiles targeting several cities but, hitting central-eastern Dnipro the hardest. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed that Russia's assault on the city included its first use during the war of an intercontinental ballistic missile, though a Western official told CBS News on Thursday that an ICBM was not used in the strike.",
      "Two U.S. officials also told CBS News that Russia had fired a ballistic missile, not an ICBM on Thursday, with one saying it appeared to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile launched from just east of Volgograd, Russia, to target Dnipro. If accurate, that would be a flight path of about 500 miles.",
      "Despite the denials from U.S. officials, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on social media that \"all the characteristics\" of a Russian missile used in the strike on Dnipro \"corresponds to an intercontinental ballistic missile,\" though he said an investigation was underway to confirm exactly what had been fired at the city.",
      "Zelenskyy accused \"our crazy neighbor\" Russia of using his country \"as a testing ground\" for its new weapons.",
      "During a live televised news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova received a phone call and a man identified only as \"Masha\" could be heard ordering her not to make any comment on the \"ballistic missile strike that the Westerners have started talking about\" in Dnipro.",
      "The Ukrainian air force did not say what the purported Russian ICBM had targeted or whether it had caused any damage, but the Dnipro regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said the strike damaged an industrial enterprise and ignited fires in the city, wounding 15 people.",
      "The Ukrainian Air Force said the Russian attack also included a Kinzhal hypersonic missile and seven cruise missiles \u2014 all weapons used many times previously by Russia during the war. Six of the Russian missiles were shot down, the air force said.",
      "The strike came hours after the CBS News team in Kyiv, along with hundreds of thousands of residents of the Ukrainian capital, were forced to scramble for cover in underground parking lots, metro stations and basements on Wednesday as air raid alarms sounded.",
      "In the end, no missiles landed on Wednesday, leaving Ukraine to accuse Russia of a psychological attack.",
      "\"We are very worried,\" one young Kyiv resident told CBS News. \"We want to keep our country. We want to live in peace.\"",
      "After more than two and a half years of war in Ukraine, the scars and the anxiety run deep.",
      "\"It could happen any minute, any hour,\" Major Taras Berezovets, of Ukraine's Territorial Defense force, told CBS News, arguing that Russia and Putin are blackmailing his country, trying to frighten Ukrainians into surrendering \u2013 \"trying to make the conclusion that any sort of opposition to Russian invasion is absolutely useless.\"",
      "Some believe both Russia and Ukraine are trying to maximize their gains \u2014 and with them, their leverage for any future cease-fire talks \u2014 before President-elect Donald Trump comes back into office in January.",
      "There's significant fear in Ukraine and in European capitals that Trump could cut U.S. support for Kyiv, forcing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government to accept a negotiated truce with Russia that sees Ukraine give up land occupied by Putin's forces.",

      "They are believed to have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, which is sometimes added to mixed-drinks at disreputable bars as a cheaper alternative to ethanol, but can cause severe poisoning or death.",
      "Telephone numbers listed for Laos' Health Ministry did not work and police refused to comment on the incident.",
      "Australia said \"several foreign nationals\" had also been victims of methanol poisoning. The U.S. State Department confirmed that an American had also died in Vang Vieng.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring the situation and providing consular assistance,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News, adding that local authorities were responsible for determining the cause of death. The victim's name was not provided.",
      "Denmark's Foreign Ministry said two of its citizens had also died in \"the incident in Laos,\" but neither would comment directly on a link to the methanol poisoning that killed Jones.",
      "Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital on Wednesday that his daughter remained in critical condition and on life support.",
      "\"We just like to thank everyone from back home for all of the support and love that we're receiving,\" he said. \"But we'd also like the people to appreciate right now, we just need privacy so we can spend as much time as we can with Holly.\"",
      "In a statement to the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper, Jones' family asked for privacy in their grief.",
      "\"She was surrounded by love, and we are comforted by the knowledge that her incredible spirit touched so many lives during her time with us,\" the family wrote.",
      "\"We want to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming support, love, and prayers we've received from across Australia.\"",
      "Landlocked Laos is one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations and a popular tourist destination. Vang Vieng is particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports.",
      "Details on the alcohol poisoning began trickling out about a week after the two Australian women fell ill on Nov. 13 following a night out drinking with a group in the remote town.",
      "Thai authorities confirmed that Jones had died by \"brain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system.\"",
      "\"Drink spiking and methanol poisoning are far too common in many parts of the world,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said after receiving news of Jones' death.",
      "\"At this time I would say to parents, to young people, please have a conversation about risks, please inform yourselves, please let's work together to ensure this tragedy doesn't happen again.\"",
      "New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that one of its citizens was also unwell in Laos and could be a victim of methanol poisoning.",
      "\"We have updated our travel advisory for Laos to note that there have been several cases of suspected methanol poisoning after consuming alcoholic drinks,\" New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said.",
      "\"Travelers are advised to be cautious about consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly cocktails and drinks made with spirits that may have been adulterated with harmful substances.\"",
      "Australia also updated its travel advice, cautioning that several foreign nationals had been victims of suspected methanol poisoning in Laos this month. The U.S. did not immediately issue an updated travel advisory.",
      "On Tuesday, Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel where the two Australian women stayed in Vang Vieng, told the AP that staff were told by other guests that the two women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them.",

      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like antifreeze, photocopier fluids, de-icers, paint thinner, varnish, and windshield wiper fluid.",
      "Colorless, flammable, and with a similar smell, it can be easily confused with its molecular cousin ethanol, which is usually found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is toxic to humans, with exposure or ingestion being extremely dangerous if left untreated.",
      "Drinking just 25-90 milliliters of it can be lethal, according to the Methanol Institute, a global trade association for the industry.",
      "It is absorbed by the gut in less than 10 minutes, but patients may appear normal for the first 12 to 24 hours after ingestion.",
      "It will then cause nausea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain, followed by hyperventilation and difficulty breathing.",
      "Partial or complete blindness from methanol poisoning is common, and if left untreated, it can lead to a coma and even death.",
      "However, in smaller amounts, rapid diagnosis -- within 10-30 hours of ingestion -- and treatment can reduce the severest symptoms.",
      "People with suspected methanol poisoning should immediately consult a medical toxicologist or poison center.",

      "The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with controversial anti-personnel mines in its war against Russia, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News Tuesday night.",
      "Anti-personnel mines, or APLs, are designed to be used against people, not vehicles. They can be rapidly deployed and are meant to blunt the advances of ground forces, making them useful for Ukraine's defense against Russia's advances in Eastern Ukraine, the official said.",
      "The U.S. sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use to further limit the risk to civilians, the official said, noting that Ukrainians are committed to not employing the mines in areas populated with their own civilians.",
      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "U.S.-supplied ATACMS were used Tuesday on targets inside Russia, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv closed its doors on Wednesday and warned there were indications Russia was poised to launch a possible \"significant air attack\" on Ukraine.",
      "Exactly 1,000 days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighboring nation, Ukrainian forces fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russian territory on Tuesday, U.S. officials have confirmed to CBS News. It was the first time Ukrainian forces had taken advantage of President Biden's easing of restrictions over the weekend on Ukraine's use of the U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia.",

      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,\" the alert said, adding that U.S. nationals in the country should be \"prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\"",

Soon after, air raid sirens blared across Kyiv and other major cities, forcing thousands of people to seek shelter underground before the alert was lifted.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday the military had shot down five ATACMS fired by Ukraine and damaged another. The reports said fragments had fallen at or near a military facility and that some of the debris had ignited a fire, but the ministry said there was no damage or casualties.",
      "According to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the ATACMS are a \"long-range, guided missile that gives commanders the immediate firepower to shape the battlespace.\" Each of the weapons can carry a fragmentation warhead of up to 500 pounds, with a maximum range of 300 kilometers, or about 186 miles.",
      "The U.S. officials told CBS News that Russia may have shot down two of the ATACMS launched by Ukraine in the strike.",
      "The Ukrainian strike on Russia's western Bryansk region came hours after another Ukrainian residential neighborhood was left charred and smoking. Ukrainian officials said 10 people were killed Monday in a Russian drone and missile attack on the southern city of Odesa. That strike came a day after another strike on the power grid in Odesa, which also destroyed several homes.",

      "Mr. Biden only agreed to Ukraine's long-sought permission to fire ATACMS into Russia on Sunday. He had been worried that such a decision could escalate the conflict.",
      "But the Kremlin has appeared less concerned about stoking fears of an escalation. Putin formally approved a change in Russia's nuclear doctrine Tuesday, lowering the threshold for a potential nuclear strike.",

      "Russia and Ukraine have both kept their respective death tolls from the war secret, but Ukraine's military has undeniably paid a steep price for trying to defend the country from the invasion, with around 70,000 troops believed to have been killed. More than 100,000 soldiers from Russia \u2014 a country with a population more than three times larger than Ukraine's \u2014 have been killed, according to U.S. officials.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:33:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, is accused of concealing that a solar energy project was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the U.S. on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",
      "Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to \"obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said.",
      "In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions.",
      "Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board.",
      "Online court records did not list a lawyer who could speak on Adani's behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of his conglomerate, the Adani Group. Emails were also sent to lawyers representing his co-defendants. Sagar Adani's lawyer, Sean Hecker, declined the comment. The others did not immediately respond.",
      "Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting \"not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.\"",
      "According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Adani is the 19th richest person in the world with an estimated total net worth of about $85.5 billion. However, that is down significantly from 2022, when he briefly overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as No. 2 on the list with a net worth of more than $146 billion.",
      "He is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil.",
      "In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: \"Growth with Goodness.\"",
      "Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of \"brazen stock manipulation\" and \"accounting fraud.\" The Adani Group called the claims \"a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.\"",
      "The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin approved changes to his country's nuclear doctrine this week, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons. Moscow announced Tuesday that Putin had signed off on the changes to the doctrine, formally known as \"The basics of state policy in the field of nuclear deterrence,\"  as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia using U.S.-supplied missiles.",
      "The updated doctrine states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both. That means any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group.",
      "Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "U.S. officials said Ukraine fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia's Bryansk region early Tuesday, just a couple days after President Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire the weapons deeper into Russian territory. ATACMS are powerful weapons with a maximum range of almost 190 miles.",
      "\"This is the latest instance of a long string of nuclear rhetoric and signaling that has been coming out of Moscow since the beginning of this full scale invasion,\" Mariana Budjeryn, Senior Research Associate at Harvard's Belfer Center, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the change to Russia's nuclear doctrine was first proposed last month.",
      "\"The previous version of the Russian doctrine adopted in 2020 allowed also a nuclear response to a large-scale conventional attack, but only in extreme circumstances where the very survival of the state was at stake,\" Budjeryn noted. \"This formulation has changed to say, well, extreme circumstances that jeopardize the sovereignty of Russia. Well, what does that really mean and who defines what serious threats to sovereignty might constitute?\"",

So when we have an incoming from Russia to Ukraine and we see that it's an Iskander missile, we don't know if it's nuclear tipped or conventionally tipped,\" Budjeryn said.",

In the city's biggest national security case to date, they were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets after potentially securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and the ouster of the city's leader.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me. How can you stop a girl from her school? They come up with these excuses that it's culture, it's religion. There is no culture, excuse. The true representatives of that culture are the Afghan women and girls that we've seen in the documentary.\"",
      "The documentary follows three Afghan women who secretly filmed their protests.

      "Sweeney's tenure of supporting roles in some of HBO's biggest hits led to a multimillion-dollar payout in the form of blockbuster movie roles as she has moved from supporting star to Hollywood's \"it girl.\"",

      "\"To her credit, for all the 'it girls' who had their 15 minutes of fame, few used that platform to fortify their fan base while working to diversify their portfolio, both vertically and laterally,\" branding expert Doug Eldridge told Fox News Digital. \"Sweeney understands how the 'scaffolding model' works and is utilizing it to great effect.\"",
      "\"Sweeney also has a unique sense of relatability. She attracts male viewers but doesn't turn off female fans,\" he added. \"This is a more tenuous high-wire balancing act than you might imagine. Over the last 30 years, Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston made their entire career by playing a singular role ('Pretty Woman' and \u2018Friends,\u2019 respectively). They can do no wrong in the minds of female fans, but they don't necessarily garner that same fervor among male fans.\"",
      "Sydney Sweeney \"has a unique sense of relatability,\" according to branding expert Doug Eldridge. (Earl Gibson III/Penske Media via Getty Images)",
      "He continued, \"By contrast, Angelina Jolie drew a massive male audience but was largely vilified and rejected by female viewers. I draw that parallel to put Sweeney's rise in context: She has taken a brick-by-brick approach, navigating and balancing between her looks, her likability and her raw theatrical talent. She is becoming a Swiss army knife of ability, a versatile tool in Hollywood, that doesn't come around very often. There's also a sense of humility and self-depreciation that is endearing to both male and female fans, and that's an increasingly rare trait these days.\"",
      "\"Sweeney also has a unique sense of relatability. She attracts male viewers but doesn't turn off female fans. This is a more tenuous high-wire balancing act than you might imagine.\"",
      "Sweeney earned $2 million for her role in \"Anyone But You\" alongside Glen Powell, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film, which premiered in December 2023, earned $220 million at the box office using a $25 million budget, the outlet reported. Sweeney also reportedly made $250,000 in an executive producing fee.",

      "Sweeney's rise to Hollywood \"it girl\" came from \"strategic career planning,\" Gary Frayter, celebrity brand and social media director with Kronus Communications, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"By choosing diverse and challenging roles early on, she built credibility and a loyal fan base,\" he said. \"Beyond acting, she leveraged her momentum by founding her own production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, which allowed her to take control of her career trajectory and explore behind-the-scenes opportunities. This strategic approach, paired with brand partnerships and a strong social media presence, has positioned her as both a Hollywood star and a savvy entrepreneur.\"",
      "\"Sydney's journey exemplifies the power of blending artistic talent with entrepreneurial foresight to achieve sustained success in the entertainment industry,\" Frayter added.",
      "Sydney Sweeney starred as Cassie Howard on the HBO show \"Euphoria\" in one of her earlier roles. (Jeff Kravitz)",
      "One strategic move Sweeney made was to take the supporting role in \"Madame Web,\" for which she was reportedly paid $750,000. The actress took the role in the Spider-Man universe film for Sony Pictures to pick up \"Anyone But You.\"",
      "\"She wanted them to know she was a team player,\" a source told THR.",
      "Sweeney's ability to showcase her \"versatility\" has definitely helped the rising star, but isn't her \"most significant move,\" according to Eldridge.",
      "\"'Madame Web' was a box-office bomb, but it was another feather in the cap for Sweeney,\" he said. \"It's not so much a case of 'failing upward' as it is consistently expanding her base and showcasing her versatility. By contrast, she played to her core base with the rom-com 'Anyone But You' and literally laughed all the way to the bank as the film raked in more than $230 million at the global box office. The real significance of that haul is that it didn't come on the heels of a glitzy marketing campaign, it was driven almost entirely by fan support. That's a testament both to her fan base and her emerging star power.\"",

    "summary": "House lawmakers were briefed Wednesday about the potential outcome of a U.S.-China war over Taiwan within the next two years, as the global superpower increasingly encroaches on U.S. allies.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping met on Saturday at the APEC Summit in Lima, Peru. (Reuters)",
      "House lawmakers were briefed Wednesday about the potential outcome if the U.S. were to find itself at war with China over Taiwan within the next two years, as the global superpower increasingly encroaches on U.S. allies.",
      "The Chinese defense industrial base is operating at a \"wartime footing,\" and now has a shipbuilding capacity 230 times greater than the U.S.\u2019s, making a potential invasion of Taiwan a not-unlikely outcome.",
      "U.S. military analysts have projected 2027 as the year by which China would be fully equipped for a military invasion of Taiwan. And the U.S. has long followed a policy of refusing to say whether it would come to the island\u2019s defense under such a scenario.",
      "But under war exercises gamed out by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 25 times and presented to members of the House China Select Committee, the alliance of the U.S., Taiwan and Japan defeated an amphibious invasion by China and maintained an autonomous Taiwan, but not without suffering heavy losses.",
      "WOULD THE US DEFEND TAIWAN UNDER TRUMP IF CHINA INVADES? FOX NEWS INVESTIGATES",
      "During the simulation, the cost for all sides was high \u2014 there were more than 10,000 casualties \u2014 and the U.S. lost 10-20 warships, two aircraft carriers, 200-400 warplanes and more than 3,000 troops were killed over the first three weeks of fighting.",
      "China loses 90% of its amphibious fleet, 52 major surface warships and 160 warplanes.",
      "\"In our tabletop exercise today, we walked through one simulation of what might happen in a worst-case scenario conflict with China and learned ways we can work together in a bipartisan manner to ensure that America is prepared to be the arsenal of democracy once more if called upon. No matter where or when, the United States and our allies must have the military means to defeat our adversaries,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, told Fox News Digital.",
      "A Chinese Coast Guard vessel patrols at the disputed Scarborough Shoal. (Castro/File Photo)",
      "The report emphasized four key points: 1) Taiwan must \"hold the line\" of the ground invasion, 2) there is no \"Ukraine\" model where the U.S. can slowly escalate \u2014 it must decide immediately whether it will come to Taiwan's defense, 3) military operations would need to be conducted through Japan and 4) the U.S. needs to immediately increase its supply of anti-ship missiles.",
      "The bottom line of the report is that China chooses \"D-Day,\" but Taiwan and its defenders must be ready at any moment. The war game assumed a 2026 launch date for China\u2019s invasion.",
      "The scenario operates under the assumption that the U.S. under President-elect Trump would come to Taiwan\u2019s defense, though no such promise has been made. It\u2019s unclear what Trump would do under such a scenario \u2014 he has mused about Taiwan needing to pay the U.S. for giving it defensive aid.",
      "Japan would be the U.S. and Taiwan\u2019s key ally in such a fight because South Korea has not authorized the U.S. to launch combat missions from its territory. CSIS recommends deepening U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations immediately.",
      "XI JINPING WARNS TRUMP US WOULD 'LOSE FROM CONFRONTATION' WITH CHINA AS RENEWED TRADE WAR LOOMS",
      "\"It certainly would be very helpful if South Korea stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us,\" said Matthew Cancian, researcher at the Naval War College and lead author of the project. The U.S. would likely move two of the four squadrons it has stationed in South Korea to help with the fight against China over Taiwan.",
      "But, as the presenters warned, North Korea may try to take advantage of the situation and invade the south, especially after gaining operational experience from their fight with Russia against Ukraine.",
      "The exercise also claimed that unlike U.S. aid to Ukraine, which passes over NATO territory to arrive there, the U.S. would not be able to arm Taiwan without sending in U.S. forces \u2014 China\u2019s anti-tank or anti-air missiles would threaten any shipments making their way to the island.",
      "\"U.S. forces would have to be directly involved,\" said Cancian. \"There is no way to achieve denying a takeover of Taiwan while also keeping U.S. forces safe.\"",
      "And if the U.S. were to come to Taiwan's defense, there would be no time to waste since China is much closer geographically than U.S. forces. \"If the U.S. were not to join the fight for two weeks [after an invasion], it would be too late. China would already have too strong a footing,\" said Cancian.",
      "Chinese land attack missiles and anti-ship missiles would pose the greatest threat in the theater. Harpoons and coastal defense cruise missiles would be \"absolutely critical\" to Taiwan\u2019s defense, according to the wargame exercise.",
      "China is outproducing the U.S. on airplanes, ships and missiles, the exercise found, and in order to deter them from provoking war over Taiwan, the U.S. needs to immediately ramp up its production of key munitions, per the war games.",
      "The U.S.\u2019s current stockpile of anti-ship missiles, around 440, would run out in less than seven days in a war with China.",
      "China would not be keen to give up easily, as a loss in Taiwan could be \"very destabilizing\" to the government\u2019s legitimacy back at home.",
      "The war games also underscored the need for the Taiwanese defense budget to stop focusing on expensive, large ships that China will easily destroy and focus on smaller, more survivable ships and submarines.",

      "A Chinese naval fleet passes through a mine threat area. (Sun Zifa/China News Service via Getty Images)",
      "The U.S., too, must focus on arming Taiwan with smaller ships and cheaper munitions, with most iterations of the war games finding the U.S. losing two aircraft carriers and\u00a010 to 20 large surface combatants.",
      "\"We need to make them fire their exquisite stuff at our non-exquisite stuff,\" said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla. \"They\u2019re going to out-produce us\u2026 we need to wake up.\"",
      "The U.S. and Taiwan must not attack the Chinese mainland, both to avoid risking escalation with a nuclear power and because Chinese air defense on the mainland is \"too strong.\"",
      "Ultimately, such an invasion could happen sooner, or not at all.",
      "The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) head, Adm. Samuel Paparo, said recently he believes the U.S. would make it \"exceedingly difficult\" for China to mount a cross-strait invasion.",
      "For years, the U.S. military has been pivoting its focus from the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific, \"the most stressing theater,\" as Paparo describes it, given that China is the most capable potential adversary in the world.",
      "According to Chinese policy, the CCP will invade only if Taiwan declares its independence from China, if a third power intervenes in the dispute or\u00a0Beijing determines that \"unification was irrevocably beyond its reach by any other means.\"",
      "While the U.S. has no formal alliance with Taiwan, China has been encroaching on the air and sea territory of U.S. allies in the Pacific \u2014 Japan and the Philippines.",
      "Paparo said\u00a0he'd\u00a0seen \"the most rehearsal and the most joint exercises\" from\u00a0China over the summer that \"I'd seen over an entire career of being an observer.\"",

      "Though not yet at the level of countries like Japan and China, which are now facing shrinking populations, Pakaluk said the result is that there are \"fewer and fewer workers,\" fewer people paying into the tax base, and government programs such as social security and Medicare are becoming increasingly unviable.",

      "Most crucial to Pakaluk, however, is advancing values that lead to people choosing to have bigger families. She recently published a book called \"Hannah\u2019s Children\" in which she did extensive interviews with mothers who decided to have five or more kids. The common denominator among these women, who came from a wide array of faith backgrounds, was a strong religious belief in children as blessings from God.",

      "\"What I like to say is, I don't know that you can get more children out of being pro-child. \u2026 But I think you can get more children if you're pro-church or pro-religious community,\" she said. \"If people encounter strong religious communities on a more regular basis, this can change in a generation.\"",

      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",

      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected.

      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",

      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",

      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",

Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",

Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s immigration policy is in desperate need of a high-tech overhaul.\u00a0 Most online immigration tools so far have been rudimentary, and that\u2019s often left legal immigrants complaining of long wait times, contradictory instructions, and a web presence that doesn't help with things like green card renewal or family petitions.\u00a0 Now President-Elect Trump is promising a big deportation push when he comes into office for his second term, and it\u2019s more important than ever for immigrants to have their paperwork in order.",
      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",
      "And Soroori says their intake protocol is much more simple and cost-effective than going to see an immigration attorney.\u00a0 \"Once the user finds us on our website and goes to the platform,\" she explains, \"they are able to select the service that pertains to them, answer a simplified questionnaire, upload the necessary documents, we\u2019ll even take care of the passport pictures for them.

      "As the immigration debate heats up, Consulta is getting more visibility; it has a number of high-profile backers, including the founder of Venmo.\u00a0 Right now, services include renewing green cards, petitions for family visas, and help with citizenship.\u00a0 It\u2019s all part of using A.I. to deliver a more streamlined immigration experience.",
      "\"We always talk about the negativity about immigration, but we don't focus on the legal immigrants that are in this country,\" says Soroori. \"And we wanted to offer them the most stress free, affordable option in order for more people to pursue it.\""

At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",

      "The breach notification service\u00a0Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) announced this week that it alerted 56 million Hot Topic customers about a data breach compromising their personal information. While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program. The hacker is offering the database for $20,000 and demanding that Hot Topic pay $100,000 to prevent its sale.",
      "Hudson Rock, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, initially reported the breach and considers it credible. The firm traced the issue back to a malware infection on an employee\u2019s computer at Robling, a third-party retail analytics firm. Hudson Rock, which operates the cyber intelligence platform Cavalier to monitor compromised devices, discovered the infection and flagged it for clients.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the threat actor used credentials stolen by info stealer malware to gain access to an analytics platform used by Hot Topic, potentially allowing them to infiltrate the retailer\u2019s cloud environments.",

Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach.

      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",
      "DON\u2019T LET SNOOPS NEARBY LISTEN TO YOUR VOICEMAIL WITH THIS QUICK TIP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",

      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",

Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data.

      "When CyberGuy reached out to T-Mobile regarding the latest security incident, a spokesperson provided the following statement: \"T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack. Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",

      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

      "Before we blame the VPN, let's make sure it's really the culprit. Here's a quick test:",
      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

This incredible piece of tech solves a major problem that other exoskeletons face. You see, most exoskeletons require helpers to lift users out of their wheelchairs and strap them in. But the WalkON Suit F1? It's got a nifty front-docking system that lets the person put it on while still seated in their wheelchair. Talk about independence.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The suit features a system \"that actively controls the center of its weight against the pull of gravity\" to prevent it from toppling over as the person stands up.

Particularly divisive are recent reports on Hamas\u2019 use of hospitals.",
      "On Nov. 3, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which oversees the humanitarian-civil effort in Gaza, reported that during its attempts to evacuate patients and staff from Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza, terrorists \"detonated an explosive device only a few hundred meters away from the [Kamal Adwan] hospital.\" While the convoy was spared injuries, COGAT reported that six children in the hospital were injured.",

      "The use of Kamal Adwan Hospital by Hamas has been previously confirmed, including by Ahmad Kahlot, a high-ranking Hamas member and former director of the hospital. In December 2023, Kahlot admitted that Kamal Adwan Hospital was used \"to hide high-ranking military activists,\" who know they \"won\u2019t be targeted when they are in the hospital.\" The hospital, he said, contained housing for the terrorists as well as \"areas for interrogations, internal and special security.\"",

      "Bayefsky noted that Israel has \"publicly exposed, with photographic and video evidence, the use of hospitals by Hamas for military purposes,\" including underground tunnels \"that utilized the power sources and served as command centers and weapons depots; weapons and equipment on hospital floors alongside patient wards; weapons hidden in incubators; and the use of hospitals as operational facilities to direct military activity.\"",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital's health team evacuate Palestinian patients after Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on May 21, 2024. (Karam Hassan/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "In its report, the commission also described how \"two [Israeli] hostages had been held in [Gazan] hospitals and received medical treatment for their wounds.\" What the commission failed to mention, according to Bayefsky, is that the hostages\u2019 \"treatment\" involved \"doctors pouring chlorine and vinegar onto hostage\u00a0Maya Regev's dangling foot in order to cause pain,\" or cutting \"into her without pain relievers.\" They also fail to address how \"Gazan doctors pulled a bullet from hostage\u00a0Itay Regev's leg without using anesthesia while Hamas members spat on him, slapped him and threatened to kill him if he screamed.\"",
      "Fox News Digital asked the Commission of Inquiry why it did not include information about the use of Kamal Adwan Hospital by Hamas, why it failed to recount the maltreatment Israeli hostages received, and whether it believed there could be a non-military purpose for the Hamas tunnels found below medical facilities.",
      "A spokesperson from the commission told Fox News Digital that the report\u2019s findings \"were made in accordance with international standards and based on reasonable grounds to believe.\" The spokesperson explained the commission used \"specific hospitals\" as \"emblematic cases,\" and lamented that the commission has not been allowed into Gaza \"to conduct investigations on the ground or speak to victims and witnesses.\"",

      "Mimran also added that the provision of international law that protects against entry into a hospital \"can be eroded if the hospital is being misused in order to bring about a military advantage to Hamas,\" whether it is being used to store weapons, act as a headquarters, or holds hostages. In those cases, \"Israel has a right to enter the hospital, to operate from within the hospital,\" but must \"minimize any harm to the functionality of the hospital.\" If a hospital is being used as a permanent structure to \"promote attacks against an army,\" Israel could \"treat the hospital as a military object.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:35:02 GMT",
    "summary": "A woman told police that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary, took her phone and blocked her from leaving his hotel room before sexually assaulting her in 2017 after a Republican women\u2019s convention in California, according to official records of a police investigation released Wednesday night.",
    "story": [
      "A woman told police that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary, took her phone and blocked her from leaving his hotel room before sexually assaulting her in 2017 after a Republican women\u2019s convention in California, according to official records of a police investigation released Wednesday night.",
      "The documents released by the Monterey Police Department say the woman, identified only as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d didn\u2019t remember much else about the Oct. 7, 2017, incident and believed some form of drug may have been slipped into her drink, she told an emergency room nurse days later.",
      "Hegseth was not charged and he denies any wrongdoing. His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the report\u2019s description of surveillance footage at the Monterey hotel, where the woman met Hegseth, and police interviews with other people at the hotel prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cThis police report confirms what I\u2019ve said all along,\u201d Parlatore told NBC News on Thursday. \u201cThe incident was fully investigated and police found the allegation to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\u201d",
      "Police did not give a reason for not charging him. The report said that surveillance footage shows the woman, Hegseth and an unknown woman walk into the hotel lobby and toward the bar together around midnight. Another video shows the two walking together with their arms interlocked shortly after 1 a.m., the report said.",
      "At least three people told police that the woman appeared coherent and not intoxicated throughout the night and early morning, according to the report.",
      "The allegations emerged last weekend when Hegseth confirmed he had paid an undisclosed amount as part of a settlement with his accuser. In a previous statement, Parlatore said \u201cHegseth strongly felt that he was the victim of blackmail and innocent collateral damage in a lie that the Complainant was holding onto to keep her marriage intact.\u201d",
      "Parlatore said Hegseth \u201cultimately decided to enter into a settlement for a significantly reduced amount\u201d at the \u201cheight of the MeToo movement.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment about the report\u2019s release. In a statement last week, Trump communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth has \u201cvigorously denied any and all accusations\u201d and that Trump is \u201cnominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor, is one of three high-profile picks to join Trump\u2019s new Cabinet who have faced serious allegations of sexual impropriety.",
      "The report said the unidentified woman, who later went to a hospital for a sexual assault exam, confronted Hegseth, a guest speaker at the event, because \u201cshe did not appreciate how he treated women,\u201d the report said.",
      "The woman said she was drinking a \u201csmall amount of Champagne\u201d at an after-party but didn\u2019t remember having any \u201chard alcohol.\u201d She and a group of other women went to a bar attached to the hotel, where she had more to drink, while Hegseth was allegedly also present.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when things got fuzzy,\u201d she told police. When she left the bar, she said Hegseth followed her, she assumed because of their earlier argument, according to the report. She told police she remembered Hegseth saying he was a \u201cnice guy.\u201d",
      "The woman said she then found herself in an unknown room. She told police that Hegseth asked whom she was texting and took her phone from her, before physically blocking her attempt to leave the room.",
      "\u201cJANE DOE remembered saying \u2018no\u2019 a lot,\u201d the report said. \u201cJANE DOE\u2019s next memory was when she was on a bed or a couch and HEGSETH was over her.\u201d",
      "She said his dog tags were hovering over her face and that he was bare-chested.",
      "She told police he ejaculated onto her stomach, before throwing her a towel and asking \u201cAre you OK?\u201d",
      "The woman said she does not remember how she got back to her hotel room, which she was sharing with her husband, and that the alleged encounter with Hegseth didn\u2019t dawn on her until she had returned home. Four days later, she went to the hospital for an exam, the report said.",
      "Investigators were alerted to the alleged assault by an emergency room nurse who treated the accuser Oct. 12, 2017. The nurse said the patient wished to be identified as Jane Doe and wanted a sexual assault examination.",
      "The patient said she could not remember \u201cmost of the night\u2019s events,\u201d including whether any sexual penetration occurred, the nurse told police. The woman told the nurse that she believed \u201csomething may have been slipped into her drink\u201d and that she was sexually assaulted, but did not want to disclose the suspect\u2019s name, according to the report.",
      "Investigators also interviewed the accuser, her husband, at least one woman who attended the convention, a hotel worker and Hegseth.",
      "In a telephone interview Oct. 26, 2017, Hegseth told police after the event that he had sex with the woman in his hotel room butthat  it was consensual and that he made sure she was comfortable with what was going on.",
      "He said he had not planned to initiate sex with her and that he \u201cthought it was odd\u201d she stayed in his room, according to the police report. \u201cShe sat down in the room and did not leave,\u201d the report said.",
      "Hegseth told police he and the woman would both stop and say \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d though they mutually continued, according to the report.",
      "Afterwards, Hegseth said, the woman said she would tell her husband she had fallen asleep on a couch in someone else\u2019s room. She showed \u201cearly signs of regret,\u201d Hegseth said, although he did not elaborate on what those signs were.",
      "When the woman returned to her own hotel room around 4 a.m., she was apologetic and told her husband that she \u201cmust have fallen asleep,\u201d he told police. He said she \u201cdid not have a hard time walking and was not slurring her words,\u201d according to the report.",
      "A hotel employee told police that Hegseth \u201cwas very intoxicated\u201d but the woman was not and that she was \u201cstanding on her own and was very coherent.\u201d",
      "A woman who was at the bar with them told police the accuser drank a glass of champagne and some vodka at the after-party and at least one alcoholic beverage at the bar, but she was coherent and did not seem intoxicated. The woman said the accuser appeared to flirt with Hegseth by touching his body or arm, the report said.",
      "On Thursday, Hegseth told reporters on the Hill after meeting with senators that he looks forward to engaging in the confirmation process and is taking nothing for granted.",
      "When asked if he sexually assaulted a woman in Monterrey, Hegseth said: \u201cAs far as the media is concerned, I\u2019ll keep this very simple. The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to leave it.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Within hours of taking office, Donald Trump is planning to roll out executive actions aligned with his campaign promises on immigration and other policies.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Within hours of taking office as president, Donald Trump plans to roll out a flurry of executive actions aligned with his campaign promises, imposing more socially conservative health care policies on the U.S. military and setting in motion the large-scale deportation of people living in the country illegally.",
      "NBC News spoke with more than half a dozen people familiar with transition planning who outlined a number of quick actions Trump plans to take to signal a dramatic break from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which Trump claimed was leading the country to ruin.",
      "Americans will see the new Trump administration enact changes at a pace that is \u201clike nothing you\u2019ve seen in history,\u201d a Trump campaign official said.",
      "Trump is preparing on Day One to overturn specific policies put in place by Biden, with plans to end travel reimbursement for military members seeking abortion care and to restrict transgender service members\u2019 access to gender-affirming care, two people familiar with the plans said.",
      "But much of the first day is likely to focus on stopping illegal immigration \u2014 the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s candidacy. He is expected to sign up to five executive orders aimed at dealing with that issue alone after he is sworn in on Jan. 20, three Trump allies said on condition of anonymity.",
      "By contrast, that is as many orders as he signed on all issues during the first week of his last term.",
      "\u201cThere will without question be a lot of movement quickly, likely Day One, on the immigration front,\u201d a top Trump ally said. \u201cThere will be a push to make a huge early show and assert himself to show his campaign promises were not hollow.\u201d",
      "Transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \u201cThe American people can bank on President Trump using his executive power on day one to deliver on the promises he made to them on the campaign trail.\u201d",
      "Advisers based at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort or at nearby offices in West Palm Beach, Florida, are also strategizing about ending the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and preparing Trump\u2019s return to the world stage after a four-year absence.",
      "During the campaign, Trump promised he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in just 24 hours \u2014 a time frame that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has cast doubt upon.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team is also fielding requests from overseas to host his first foreign trip.",
      "Coming off a decisive victory on Nov. 5, Trump has moved swiftly to build out the Cabinet and a senior White House team that will execute his plans.",
      "As of Wednesday, he had selected 32 people for senior positions in his administration, compared with just three at a similar point in his 2016 transition. At this point four years ago, Biden had chosen just one person for a senior role in his incoming administration: Ron Klain for White House chief of staff.",
      "Trump may enter the White House better positioned to both spell out and enact his agenda than in his first go-round.",
      "A kind of government-in-waiting of Trump administration alumni and allies has spent years working at Washington think tanks since he left office crafting policies to put in place upon his return. A group started after Trump left office, the America First Policy Institute, which is led by a number of his former appointees, has drafted proposed executive orders for the transition team to consider.",
      "Transition aides are sorting through scores of proposed orders, while Trump\u2019s eldest son sits in on some meetings devoted to choosing personnel, two people close\u00a0to the transition said.",
      "Donald Trump Jr. was among those who privately voiced opposition to rehiring Mike Pompeo, who was secretary of state and CIA director in the first Trump administration, the person close to him said.",
      "\u201cHe viewed him as ideologically out of sync on foreign policy. Too hawkish and internationalist,\u201d the person said. \u201cDon would like to see as many people in the administration who reflect his father\u2019s worldview, because he believes that\u2019s the best way to protect his dad\u2019s interests.\u201d",
      "Trump needs to move quickly to enact his agenda given the realities of the electoral calendar. Under the Constitution\u2019s 22nd Amendment, he can serve only one term. Come 2026, Congress will be focused on midterm elections that could erode Trump\u2019s narrow GOP majority or wipe it out altogether.",
      "\u201cThe thing to realize is Trump is no dummy,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser in Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s got two to three years at most to get anything done. And then he becomes a lame duck and we start talking about [the presidential election in] 2028.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he really wants to Secretariat right out of the gate,\u201d Moore added, referring to the champion thoroughbred racehorse.",
      "It\u2019s easy enough to announce new policies when the starting gun sounds; bringing them to fruition will take time. Major questions surround separate pieces of Trump\u2019s agenda, including the tax cut package he promised. Will Trump follow through on his promise and eliminate taxes on tips or Social Security benefits, for example?",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not even sure what will be in the plan,\u201d Moore said.",
      "Passing a tax cut will be so daunting a challenge that after having secured the border, Trump needs to make it an overriding priority, said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a Trump ally.",
      "Gingrich said he has spoken to Trump advisers about making the tax cut package a centerpiece of the new administration.",
      "\u201cYou get overwhelmed by how many things you\u2019re doing,\u201d Gingrich told NBC News. \u201cThey have to take a page out of Ronald Reagan\u2019s book and focus the entire Cabinet on passing the tax cuts.\u201d",
      "Deporting people on the scale Trump envisions figures to be a logistical challenge that would take years to carry out. What he has in mind goes far beyond what he did last time.",
      "During the first term, Trump\u2019s administration deported about 1.4 million people. Biden is on track to deport about 1.6 million people by the time his term ends, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\u201cThe president is moving with clarity and purpose on his picks around DHS and the border in general,\u201d said Chad Wolf, who was acting secretary of homeland security in the Trump administration. \u201cIt was a campaign promise, and I think that polling shows that the American people did not like the direction of the Biden-Harris administration on this issue, so it made complete sense to put together a team and to do that quickly and to have that team to start to move out.\u201d",
      "A key figure in the effort will be Trump\u2019s choice for homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. As governor of South Dakota, she hasn\u2019t managed a bureaucracy remotely like the Department of Homeland Security, which employs more than a quarter-million people and whose portfolio also includes cyber threats and terrorism.",
      "Noem campaigned for Trump, though a person close to Trump was surprised he tapped her for the job. Trump hadn\u2019t \u201ctalked very favorably about her\u201d after her book came out in the spring revealing she had killed her overly aggressive dog, Cricket, the person said.",
      "Trump was incredulous that she would choose to write about the episode given people\u2019s emotional attachment to their pets, the person added. He was surprised that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what the reaction would be,\u201d the person said. Trump is \u201cno dog guy, but he\u2019s like, \u2018Good Lord!\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump campaigned heavily on the promise of mass deportation and will be judged partly on how he addresses an issue that he contends threatens American sovereignty. If the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. rises, he is likely to face ridicule for failing to make good on his pledge.",
      "At the same time, he endured fierce blowback for separating families who entered the country illegally in his first term, and he invites a potentially similar reaction if he takes such an approach again in the second.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question Trump won and won big on the idea that cracking down on illegal immigration is not just a priority, but the priority,\u201d said a Trump donor who has had conversations with his transition team.",
      "Another Trump ally said the focus will be on how to expedite deportation through executive order, but the policy minutiae are still being hashed out.",
      "\u201cThis is our focus. This is what we ran on,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt will be swift, but I think a lot of what that looks like is still being discussed.\u201d",
      "Advisers are trying to think through how to repatriate those who would be deported, a person working on Trump\u2019s transition said. That will be tricky.",
      "Among the first people who could be targeted for deportation are those deemed to pose threats, possibly including Chinese men of military age who are living illegally in the U.S.",
      "But sending them back to China would involve diplomatic negotiations that would be likely to require give and take. Another possibility Trump advisers are weighing involves deporting people to third-party countries.",
      "As Trump navigates those issues, he has what his allies see as an advantage that all his predecessors lacked save for Grover Cleveland, the last president to lose an election and then return to the White House four years later. Both Cleveland in the 19th century and Trump in the 21st had hiatuses to consider what went wrong and what went right.",
      "\u201cThese are the only two guys who had four years to think about their first four years and then go back and play,\u201d Gingrich said."

      "A newly identified chemical byproduct may be present in drinking water in about a third of U.S. homes, a study found.",
      "Scientists do not yet know whether the byproduct is dangerous.",
      "But some are worried that it could have toxic properties because of similarities to other chemicals of concern.",
      "About a third of U.S. residents have been receiving tap water containing a previously unidentified chemical byproduct,\u00a0a new study has found. Some scientists are now concerned \u2014\u00a0and actively investigating \u2014 whether that chemical could be toxic.",
      "The newly identified substance, named \u201cchloronitramide anion,\u201d is produced when water is treated with chloramine, a chemical formed by mixing chlorine and ammonia. Chloramine is often used to kill viruses and bacteria in municipal water treatment systems.",
      "Researchers said the existence of the byproduct was discovered about 40 years ago, but it was only identified now because analysis techniques have improved, which finally enabled scientists to determine the chemical\u2019s structure.",
      "It could take years to figure out whether chloronitramide anion is dangerous \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s never been studied. The researchers reported their findings Thursday in the journal Science, in part to spur research to address safety concerns.",
      "The scientists said they have no hard evidence to suggest that the compound represents a danger, but that it bears similarities to other chemicals of concern. They think it deserves scrutiny because it\u2019s been detected so widely.",
      "\u201cIt has similarity to other toxic molecules,\u201d said David Wahman, one of the study\u2019s authors and a research environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWe looked for it in 40 samples in 10 U.S. chlorinated drinking water systems located in seven states. We did find it in all the samples.\u201d",
      "Chloronitramide anion is produced as chloramine decays over time. It\u2019s likely to be found in all drinking water treated via this method, he said.",
      "The fact that a byproduct with unknown risks could be so ubiquitous and evade researchers for so long renews questions about potential health effects of the chemicals used to treat tap water.",
      "Some 113 million U.S. residents receive chloramine-treated water from their taps, according to the study. The chemical has been used for about a century to disinfect water. Today, it\u2019s often used to protect a system\u2019s \u201cresidual\u201d \u2014 the water that remains in pipes for several days after it leaves a water treatment plant.",
      "Increasingly, chloramine has been favored over chlorine because the latter also produces byproducts, some of which are associated with bladder cancer and are regulated by the EPA.",
      "David Reckhow, a research professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved with the study, said the finding was an important step. The ultimate goal, he said, is understanding whether the substance is a hazard; he concurred that it was likely toxic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty small molecule and it can probably for that reason enter into biological systems and into cells. And it is still a reactive molecule,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the kinds of things you worry about.\u201d",
      "The authors of the new study arrived at their results after figuring out how to formulate high concentrations of the chemical for laboratory testing, said Julian Fairey, lead author and an associate professor at the University of Arkansas.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the toxicity but this study has enabled us to be able to do that work now,\u201d said Fairey, who studies drinking water byproducts. \u201cNow, we can go about the hard work of trying to figure out what its toxicological relevance is in our water systems.\u201d",
      "He added that some past studies have suggested a link between drinking disinfected water and increased rates of certain cancers.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving these. We have no idea if this compound is in any way related to those outcomes,\u201d Fairey said. \u201cBut we have unexplained incidents of certain types of cancer from treated drinking water.\u201d",
      "However, any conclusions about whether the newly identified substance is toxic are likely many years away. Potential regulation based on those eventual findings would take even longer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot \u2014 probably a decade of research once a funding source is found,\u201d said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.",
      "Reckhow said that in the meantime, water utilities should pay close attention to ongoing research and try to reduce people\u2019s exposure.",
      "\u201cYou do what you can to minimize,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make the best judgment you can on the toxicity and you run with incomplete information. That\u2019s the world we live in, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "The EPA only regulates a handful of disinfectant byproducts, including several associated with the use of chlorine. Scientists said those regulations have pushed some water providers to increase the use of chloramine.",
      "\u201cThis study really calls into question whether or not this disinfection process is safer from a health perspective,\u201d said David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that pushes for more scrutiny of chemicals.",
      "He added that there are hundreds of disinfection byproducts found in water systems but that this one deserves scrutiny.",
      "\u201cMany of those other contaminants are occurring at lower concentrations or less frequently,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Any treatment of drinking water involves some level of health risk, Roberson said. It\u2019s a trade-off: Disinfection processes have largely vanquished waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, but research suggests that some byproducts are associated with risks of cancer and miscarriage.",
      "\u201cThe reason you\u2019re adding the chloramine \u2014 you want to kill the bacteria and viruses, you have a real risk-risk trade-off,\u201d he said.",
      "Many U.S. water utilities disclose on their websites whether they treat the water they supply with chlorine or chloramine. Wahman said some research suggests that active carbon filters, such as those used in home water purification devices or refrigerator filters, can remove disinfectant byproducts but that more research is needed."

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:46:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun dropped over $6 million on a banana duct-taped to wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan \u2014 and he intends to eat it.",
    "story": [
      "Grocery inflation just hit its peak after a single banana was sold for $6.2 million on Wednesday.",
      "Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun dropped over $6 million on the piece of produce \u2014 because it was duct-taped to a wall.",
      "The banana is part of a piece of artwork called \"Comedian,\" created by the Italian artist and satirist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "After battling six others for the artwork at a Sotheby's auction in New York City on Wednesday, Sun \u2014 the founder of cryptocurrency TRON \u2014 naturally paid for the fruit of his labor in crypto.",
      "\"I believe this piece will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history,\" Sun said in a statement on X. \"I am honored to be the proud owner of this iconic work and look forward to it sparking further inspiration and impact for art enthusiasts around the world.\"",
      "And the billionaire plans to eat his multimillion dollar investment.",
      "\"In the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture,\" he said.",
      "Sun's snacking won't change the value of his investment, however. His $6.2 million purchase awarded him a roll of duct tape, instructions on how to \"install\" the banana properly and most importantly, a certificate of authenticity guaranteeing the artwork, when reproduced by Sun, as an original work of Cattelan\u2019s, CNBC reported.",
      "The soon-to-be devoured banana was not included in his winnings, as the fruit tends to rot quickly. But the value of the artwork is not in the banana itself \u2014 it's derived from the certificate accompanying the purchase.",
      "\u201cWhat you buy when you buy Cattelan\u2019s \u2018Comedian\u2019 is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,\u201d David Galperin, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art, told the Associated Press.",
      "For a crypto fanatic like Sun, the artwork's similarity to an NFT likely didn't go unnoticed.",
      "\"This is not just an artwork; it represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community,\" he said.",
      "\"Comedian\" debuted at Art Basel Miami in 2019, where it was priced at $120,000. The image of a banana duct-taped to a wall went viral on social media and attracted such large crowds that the artwork had to be taken down.",
      "Three editions of \"Comedian\" were created and sold, with one going to the Guggenheim Collection thanks to an anonymous donor, and the other two purchased."

      "The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "The ICC accused Netanyahu and Gallant of a string of human rights abuses in the Gaza Strip, where local health officials said the death toll from the Israeli military's yearlong assault on the Palestinian enclave had now passed 44,000.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu's office branding the decision \"antisemitic,\" rejecting the charges as \"absurd and false\" and condemning the ICC as a \"biased and discriminatory political body.\"",
      "Hamas welcomed the warrants as an \"important step towards justice\" but senior political official Basem Naim said the court's decision \"remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world to implement it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council said the U.S. \u201cfundamentally rejects the Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials,\" and it was \"deeply concerned by the prosecutor\u2019s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.\"",
      "Both Israel and the United States do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants. But the warrants do put the Israeli officials at risk of arrest in other countries, including much of Europe.",
      "In its announcement Thursday the ICC rejected challenges from Israel to its jurisdiction. It said the warrants issued for Netanyahu and Gallant were related to \"crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October, 2023 until at least 20 May, 2024,\" including \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\"",
      "It also said reasonable grounds were found to believe they bore criminal responsibility as \"civilian superiors\" for the war crime of \"intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant were accused of having \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity.\"",
      "The ICC said it further found that their conduct had hampered the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential items to those in desperate need in the enclave.",

      "The FSIS provided a list of all affected products and images of every product label that is part of the recall. The fresh products have a \u201cuse by\u201d date of Nov. 14, and the frozen ones have a \u201cuse by\u201d date of Oct. 22, they said. The recalled products list the number \u201cEST. 2574B\u201d inside the USDA mark of inspection.",
      "These products were shipped to restaurants across the country, causing the FSIS to be \u201cconcerned that some product may be in restaurant refrigerators or freezers.\u201d They're urging restaurants \u201cnot to serve these products,\u201d and encouraging consumers to \u201csafely prepare their raw meat products,\u201d advising them to cook all beef products to 160 degrees Fahrenheit to properly kill bacteria.",
      "E. coli O157:H7 is the same strain of bacteria linked to onions in some McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounders in October. It can cause intestinal bleeding, bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can damage blood vessels in the kidneys, according to the Cleveland Clinic."

    "story": [
      "Russia did not fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at Ukraine on Thursday, a U.S. official and a military officer with knowledge of the matter told NBC News, disputing a claim by Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine accused Moscow of launching the ICBM at the eastern city of Dnipro in an overnight attack, which would have marked the first recorded use of an ICBM in\u00a0an active conflict and the latest escalation by the Kremlin.",
      "U.S. officials said the weapon was in fact an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile and that Russia has a limited supply of that particular missile. Intermediate range ballistic missiles typically have a range of less than 3,500 miles.",
      "ICBMs typically have a range of more than 3,400 miles. Such missiles can carry either nuclear and nonnuclear payloads.",
      "President Vladimir Putin said, \"one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was tested in combat conditions, in this case with a ballistic missile in non-nuclear hypersonic edition.\u201d",
      "The news comes as Ukrainian forces used their first long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike Russian soil after Washington and its allies lifted restrictions on Kyiv \u2014 a move that Moscow had long warned would be met with a significant response.",
      "Putin this week lowered the bar for his country\u2019s use of a nuclear weapon, a move that was dismissed by Western officials as the latest instance of Russian saber rattling in the war, which has now lasted more than 1,000 days.",
      "'Using Ukraine as a training ground'",
      "The Ukrainian air force said early Thursday that the alleged ICBM was launched from the Caspian Sea region of Astrakhan in southern Russia at Dnipro, but did not specify exactly what model of missile was used.",
      "In a statement posted on Telegram, the air force said that Moscow had also attacked Dnipro with various other missiles. It said that Russian aircraft had fired an air-launched ballistic missile and seven cruise missiles, and that Ukrainian forces had shot down six cruise missiles.",
      "Serhii Lysak, the head of the regional authority, said on Telegram that two people were injured in the attack on Dnipro. Meanwhile, 15 people were injured in a separate attack on the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, local authorities said.",
      "The claim was quickly disputed by a Western official, who said it was a ballistic missile but not an ICBM that was fired. The Western official declined to further characterize the missile that was used, adding that its impact was still being assessed.",
      "A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the reports \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d but added that intelligence services were still looking into them.",
      "\u201cIf true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behavior from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to reflect the uncertainty.",
      "Speaking in a video posted on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that \u201ctoday, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom, and people\u2019s lives in general... he is so afraid that he is already using new missiles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a training ground,\u201d he  added, saying that that the speed and altitude of the missile that Russian forces launched suggested that it was an ICBM, but that investigations were now underway.",
      "Analysts urged caution in interpreting Thursday's claim by Kyiv.",
      "Using such a missile \u201cin a conventional role does not make a lot of sense because of their relatively low accuracy and high cost. But this kind of a strike might have a value as a signal,\u201d nuclear forces expert Pavel Podvig said.",
      "\u201cI would urge people to keep calm, not assume automatically that \u201cintercontinental\u201d is something inherently and immediately dangerous. But it should be taken seriously,\u201d Podvig, a senior researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, said in a post on X.",
      "Putin on Tuesday formally revised his country\u2019s nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document detailing the conditions under which Moscow would consider using nuclear weapons \u2014 with the change justifying a nuclear strike by Russia if attacked by a nonnuclear country that is supported by a nuclear state.",
      "Ultimately, analysts say, the likelihood of the Kremlin opting to use nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine is very slim \u2014 particularly now, when its military is advancing and its opponent is worn down.",
      "Russian forces have seized the momentum in recent months and eked out a succession of territorial gains, particularly on the eastern front lines. They have also been bolstered by thousands of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's troops in their quest to retake occupied land in Russia's Kursk border region.",
      "The West relaxing restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons may boost Kyiv but will likely do little to transform the battlefield situation, analysts said, despite the dire nature of the Kremlin's rhetorical reaction.",
      "\u201cAt this stage in the war, the risk of Russian nuclear use is lower than before. Political and battlefield developments favor Russia, so there is little to gain by escalating the conflict to the nuclear level,\u201d said Alexander Bollfrass, head of strategy, technology and arms control at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.",
      "In addition to the unclear military benefits of deploying those weapons, there would also be diplomatic drawbacks.",
      "\u201cNuclear weapons use would risk alienating China and other non-Western countries whose support or neutrality is key to maintaining the Russian war economy,\u201d Bollfrass told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cIt would also get the relationship with the incoming Trump administration off to a very dangerous start.\u201d"

    "summary": "December usually brings travelers into Haiti, but a ban on flights has halted plans for holiday gatherings and for anyone trying to deliver food, medicine and other aid.",
    "story": [
      "All travel between the U.S. and Haiti, including much-needed aid operations, continues to be impacted by a 30-day ban imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, after gunfire struck a Spirit Airlines plane as it attempted to land in Port-au-Prince.",
      "Linda Thelemaque regularly travels to the southern city of Les Cayes in her role as chief program officer of Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that helps combat poverty. She said the inability to fly in supplies has created a logistical nightmare in the Caribbean nation, where gang violence already makes ground transportation between cities nearly impossible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with severe challenges due to gang violence, which has essentially cut off ground transportation,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cNow, with flights canceled, we\u2019re facing increased costs and delays in delivering essential supplies, including $10 million worth of medication.\u201d",
      "Thelemaque had planned to travel to Haiti for work on Nov. 19, but her flight was canceled. \u201cAlthough the FAA says the ban will lift on Dec. 12, most airlines are rescheduling flights for February,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA ban has also complicated humanitarian aid efforts. \u201cWe rely on Sunrise Airways to transport supplies from Port-au-Prince to the south, but with flights grounded, we\u2019re forced to explore expensive alternatives, like chartering flights or seeking humanitarian exemptions,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, American Airlines said it had suspended its daily flights between Miami and Port-au-Prince until Feb. 12, 2025 after a separate incident involving flight 819 from Port-au-Prince to Miami last week. While the flight landed safely in Miami with no reported injuries, a post-flight inspection revealed that a bullet had struck the aircraft\u2019s exterior.",
      "Before the FAA\u2019s ban announcement, the U.S. State Department had issued an advisory to avoid traveling to Haiti due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.\u201d The department noted that airports and people traveling by car had become targets for violence.",
      "In March, escalating gang violence and unrest reached a boiling point as the Caribbean nation\u2019s government fell apart. Armed groups took over the streets, disrupting life for many residents across Port-au-Prince and driving up the cost of fuel and basic goods. \u201cPrices are being passed on to consumers, making daily survival increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, said the country\u2019s ongoing crisis has taken an emotional toll on Haitians living in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe may be physically far from Haiti, but we remain deeply connected,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are consumed by the news of worsening violence and are mourning senseless killings.\u201d",
      "The flight ban is also disrupting long-standing holiday traditions in this mostly Catholic and Christian country. Jan. 1 also holds special significance beyond New Year\u2019s Day, as it is also Haitian Independence Day and celebrated with parades, fireworks and dancing..",
      "\u201cMany Haitians save their vacations for December to reconnect with loved ones,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, that opportunity has been taken away.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that the ban extends beyond Port-au-Prince to airports throughout the country, further isolating Haitians. \u201cEven during ongoing crises, people could travel to Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes. Now the whole country feels shut down,\u201d she said.",
      "Another way to enter Haiti is by crossing through the Dominican Republic, with whom it shares the island. Haitian passport-holders with U.S. permanent residency often traveled through the DR but the country has closed its borders with Haiti due to the violence.",
      "\u201cEven if a flight diverts to the Dominican Republic, Haitian passport-holders are denied entry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSome passengers have had to return to Europe or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The U.N. reported that more than 20,000 people fled their homes in Port-au-Prince in a four-day span in November and settled in smaller cities. This has strained resources in cities like Les Cayes.",
      "\u201cThe influx of displaced residents is overwhelming clinics and creating mistrust between locals and newcomers,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Williams emphasized the growing mental health crisis in Haiti, citing a recent survey by Haitian-led organizations. \u201cThe constant trauma of gang violence is taking a toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "Even those in less-affected areas remain under stress, she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes, you worry about being next,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe trauma is pervasive, and the travel ban only adds to that stress.\u201d",
      "Both Thelemaque and Williams agree that the FAA ban, while necessary for safety, underscores the urgent need to address Haiti\u2019s escalating crisis.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to adapt,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s securing humanitarian exemptions or finding new supply routes, the people we serve rely on us.\u201d",
      "Williams called for continued advocacy. \u201cThe diaspora wants to help, but the barriers are immense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must address not only the immediate needs but also the root causes of this violence.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An Alabama inmate convicted in a 1994 murder is poised to die Thursday in the state's third nitrogen hypoxia execution this year.",
      "The emerging execution method, which involves breathing solely nitrogen gas through a mask while being deprived of oxygen, continues to draw concerns over the possibility of prolonged suffering and whether there is an unconstitutional risk of added pain.",
      "But a federal appeals court this week rejected arguments made by the condemned man's lawyers, allowing the execution of Carey Dale Grayson, 50, to proceed.",
      "Grayson is set to die at the state prison in Atmore for the abduction and killing of a hitchhiker, Vickie Deblieux, when he was 19 and his three co-defendants were younger than 18.",
      "His co-defendants' death sentences were eventually amended to life sentences after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing juveniles is unconstitutional.",
      "Protesters have sent petitions asking Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to halt Grayson's execution. Her office did not respond to a request for comment, but she is not expected to intercede, telling the Montgomery Advertiser this month when she was asked about the state's carrying out an execution a week before Thanksgiving: \"Did Carey Grayson give any consideration to the fact that he robbed Vickie Deblieux and her family of now 30 Thanksgivings?\"",
      "Grayson's lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, writing that his case \"raises issues of national importance\" among death penalty states about \"whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits suffocating a conscious prisoner and whether a state's refusal to prevent conscious suffocation via a novel method of execution superadds terror and pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"",
      "The high court has typically declined to intervene in last-minute requests to halt executions. It refused to do so when Alabama executed Kenneth Smith, the first person in the U.S. to die in a nitrogen gas execution, in January and again in September, when the state executed Alan Miller in a second nitrogen gas execution.",
      "Eyewitness reports of both executions mentioned that the men appeared to struggle while they were strapped to gurneys and being fed nitrogen. Smith, 58, did not become unconscious as quickly as expected, and he appeared to shake and writhe for two minutes, while Miller, 59, pulled against his restraints and periodically gasped for about six minutes, according to reports.",
      "In both cases, Alabama initially tried to execute the men by lethal injection, but the attempts were abandoned when prison staff members could not successfully establish intravenous lines.",
      "The series of problematic executions using lethal injection led Alabama officials to\u00a0pause the practice in 2022\u00a0and re-evaluate before they restarted it last year. Since then, Alabama has become the first state to develop a nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol in addition to lethal injection.",
      "Lethal injection remains the default method in the state, although condemned inmates can choose nitrogen hypoxia or, in some cases, electrocution.",
      "Grayson had chosen nitrogen hypoxia before a protocol for it was in place.",
      "\u201cThe State of Alabama\u2019s nitrogen protocol has been used twice and has not worked as they swore it would. Instead of taking the sensible approach and fixing the problem, they are pushing forward using the same method on Thursday,\" Grayson\u2019s lawyer John Palombi said.",
      "\"Mr. Grayson\u2019s execution should be stopped and a full, independent, and transparent examination of the protocol conducted,\u201d he added.",
      "The use of nitrogen has raised concerns among human rights groups as states have looked for viable alternatives to lethal injection,\u00a0a method that has become increasingly difficult because of a shortage of the necessary drugs.",
      "If nitrogen, a naturally occurring, colorless and odorless gas, is not mixed with enough oxygen, it can cause physical side effects, such as impaired respiration, vomiting and even death, medical experts say.",
      "During an execution, a small amount of oxygen's getting into an inmate's mask as the inmate breathes nitrogen could lead to slow asphyxiation and prolong the time it would take to die, according to the experts.",
      "In his arguments in front of the appeals court panel this week, Palombi mentioned concerns about how long Smith and Miller were conscious as their bodies reacted to the procedure.",
      "\"I would submit to the court that being conscious and being suffocated for a period of time constitutes terror that is superadded to this protocol that does not have to be there, as acknowledged by the fact that the state is willing to, if he requests it, give Mr. Grayson a sedative,\" said Palombi, who is with the Federal Defenders Program.",
      "Robert Overing, Alabama's deputy solicitor general, disagreed with Palombi's assessment and countered that nitrogen hypoxia is not akin to suffocation \"like drowning or smothering with a plastic bag or paralyzing the lungs.\"",
      "\"This is really apples and oranges trying to use the term 'suffocation' to evoke a sense of fear and pain that doesn't exist with this method,\" Overing told the court.",
      "Grayson is set to become the sixth person executed in Alabama this year.",
      "In February 1994, prosecutors say, he and three teenage friends \u2014 Kenny Loggins, Trace Duncan and Louis Mangione \u2014 were using alcohol and drugs when they encountered Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama to see her mother in Louisiana.",
      "They beat Deblieux, threw her off a cliff and mutilated her body, including cutting off her fingers, according to court records. They were linked to the crime after Mangione showed Deblieux's finger to friends, prosecutors say.",
      "Grayson, who was 19 at the time of killing, was sentenced to death, while Mangione, then 16, was given a life sentence. Death sentences for Loggins and Duncan, then both 17, were later commuted to life in prison."

    "story": [
      "All travel between the U.S. and Haiti, including much-needed aid operations, continues to be impacted by a 30-day ban imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, after gunfire struck a Spirit Airlines plane as it attempted to land in Port-au-Prince.",
      "Linda Thelemaque regularly travels to the southern city of Les Cayes in her role as chief program officer of Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that helps combat poverty. She said the inability to fly in supplies has created a logistical nightmare in the Caribbean nation, where gang violence already makes ground transportation between cities nearly impossible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with severe challenges due to gang violence, which has essentially cut off ground transportation,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cNow, with flights canceled, we\u2019re facing increased costs and delays in delivering essential supplies, including $10 million worth of medication.\u201d",
      "Thelemaque had planned to travel to Haiti for work on Nov. 19, but her flight was canceled. \u201cAlthough the FAA says the ban will lift on Dec. 12, most airlines are rescheduling flights for February,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA ban has also complicated humanitarian aid efforts. \u201cWe rely on Sunrise Airways to transport supplies from Port-au-Prince to the south, but with flights grounded, we\u2019re forced to explore expensive alternatives, like chartering flights or seeking humanitarian exemptions,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, American Airlines said it had suspended its daily flights between Miami and Port-au-Prince until Feb. 12, 2025 after a separate incident involving flight 819 from Port-au-Prince to Miami last week. While the flight landed safely in Miami with no reported injuries, a post-flight inspection revealed that a bullet had struck the aircraft\u2019s exterior.",
      "Before the FAA\u2019s ban announcement, the U.S. State Department had issued an advisory to avoid traveling to Haiti due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.\u201d The department noted that airports and people traveling by car had become targets for violence.",
      "In March, escalating gang violence and unrest reached a boiling point as the Caribbean nation\u2019s government fell apart. Armed groups took over the streets, disrupting life for many residents across Port-au-Prince and driving up the cost of fuel and basic goods. \u201cPrices are being passed on to consumers, making daily survival increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, said the country\u2019s ongoing crisis has taken an emotional toll on Haitians living in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe may be physically far from Haiti, but we remain deeply connected,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are consumed by the news of worsening violence and are mourning senseless killings.\u201d",
      "The flight ban is also disrupting long-standing holiday traditions in this mostly Catholic and Christian country. Jan. 1 also holds special significance beyond New Year\u2019s Day, as it is also Haitian Independence Day and celebrated with parades, fireworks and dancing..",
      "\u201cMany Haitians save their vacations for December to reconnect with loved ones,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, that opportunity has been taken away.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that the ban extends beyond Port-au-Prince to airports throughout the country, further isolating Haitians. \u201cEven during ongoing crises, people could travel to Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes. Now the whole country feels shut down,\u201d she said.",
      "Another way to enter Haiti is by crossing through the Dominican Republic, with whom it shares the island. Haitian passport-holders with U.S. permanent residency often traveled through the DR but the country has closed its borders with Haiti due to the violence.",
      "\u201cEven if a flight diverts to the Dominican Republic, Haitian passport-holders are denied entry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSome passengers have had to return to Europe or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The U.N. reported that more than 20,000 people fled their homes in Port-au-Prince in a four-day span in November and settled in smaller cities. This has strained resources in cities like Les Cayes.",
      "\u201cThe influx of displaced residents is overwhelming clinics and creating mistrust between locals and newcomers,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Williams emphasized the growing mental health crisis in Haiti, citing a recent survey by Haitian-led organizations. \u201cThe constant trauma of gang violence is taking a toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "Even those in less-affected areas remain under stress, she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes, you worry about being next,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe trauma is pervasive, and the travel ban only adds to that stress.\u201d",
      "Both Thelemaque and Williams agree that the FAA ban, while necessary for safety, underscores the urgent need to address Haiti\u2019s escalating crisis.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to adapt,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s securing humanitarian exemptions or finding new supply routes, the people we serve rely on us.\u201d",
      "Williams called for continued advocacy. \u201cThe diaspora wants to help, but the barriers are immense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must address not only the immediate needs but also the root causes of this violence.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:10:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Women have made significant gains in Congress in recent elections, but that progress has stalled for the first time since 2016, falling short of the current record levels.",
    "story": [
      "Women have made significant gains in Congress in recent elections, but that progress has stalled for the first time since 2016, falling short of the current record levels.",
      "The latest woman to lose her race is Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, with NBC News projecting her defeat to Republican Nick Begich in Alaska. One other female lawmaker, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, is locked in a tight and uncalled race in Southern California, where she is currently trailing Democrat Derek Tran by a narrow margin.",
      "If Steel also loses, the number of women in the next Congress, including both the House and the Senate, will reach 150 (including the eventual winner of Iowa\u2019s 1st District recount between GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Democrat Christina Bohannon). That means the next Congress could begin one fewer woman than the 151 who were in Congress on Election Day, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics\u2014 the first decline since 2010 and only the second since 1978.",
      "If Steel wins, that number would be 151, the same number of women serving in Congress on Election Day, and the first stall in progress since 2016, when President-elect Donald Trump won his first term.",
      "In both elections, Trump defeated primary and general election opponents seeking to become the first female president. After his first election, women made significant gains in Congress in the 2018 and 2020 elections, but that progress slowed in 2022 in part because House races were shaken up by redistricting, said Kelly Dittmar, director of research and a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics.",
      "Both scenarios mean the number of women in the next Congress will also fall short of the current record of 152 women, following Texas Democratic Rep. Erica Lee Carter\u2019s special election win this month.",
      "\"Progress for women in politics is not inevitable,\u201d Dittmar said. Despite the gains of 2018 and 2020, women are still outnumbered in Congress, making up 28% of lawmakers while comprising half the population.",
      "\u201cWe are already at a place where women are underrepresented, and so any decline in the pace of change means that it\u2019s going to take that much longer to get to even parity, right, which is just that base level of representation that would live up to our supposed promise of a representative democracy,\u201d Dittmar said.",
      "\u201cAny decline is a setback on that path to parity,\u201d she added.",
      "Democratic women are on track to match their current record of 94 women in the House. The Senate will include 16 Democratic women, also matching the current record, including two Black women serving together for the first time: Maryland\u2019s Angela Alsobrooks and Delaware\u2019s Lisa Blunt Rochester, who both won races for open seats. Senate Republican women will also meet their current record, with nine in the chamber.",
      "The number of House Republican women will decrease because of  some losses and retirements, falling from 34 in the current Congress to 31 or 32, depending on Steel and Miller-Meeks\u2019 races. Republican women are adding two new members to their House ranks, with North Dakota Republican Julie Fedorchak and South Carolina Republican Sheri Biggs winning two deep-red open seats.",
      "Despite that slight decline, Republican women have made significant gains in the House since reaching a low point after the 2018 midterms, when there were just 13 female Republicans in the chamber. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., has helped lead the effort to boost their ranks through her group E-PAC, and described that work in a September interview as a resounding success.\u00a0Stefanik has been nominated to be Trump's ambassador to the United Nations and could leave Congress next year if she is confirmed.",
      "\u201cWe are thrilled with the progress Republican women have made since we got into this fight in 2018, but there is always more work to be done,\u201d Danielle Barrow, executive director of Winning For Women Action Fund, a super PAC focused on electing GOP women. She noted that there were fewer competitive House races this year, and an overall decline in the number of male and female candidates stepping forward to run.",
      "\u201cThat makes our work to recruit and support high quality women candidates in primaries all the more important,\u201d she added. \u201cOur entities are proud to have raised over $13 million this cycle to support Republican women, and WFW Action Fund is doubling down on our efforts as we head into next year.\u201d",
      "Dittmar noted that Republican women have not had the same institutional support as Democratic women, who for decades have had help from groups like Emily\u2019s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.",
      "\"As we look to the future, Emily's List knows that now is not the time to rest, we're going to roll up our sleeves and continue fighting for more representation up and down the ballot,\" Sara Spain, a spokesperson for the organization, said in a statement Thursday.",
      "And while organizations such as Winning for Women and View PAC are working to close the gap on the Republican side, Dittmar said they need more support.",
      "\u201cEspecially in a moment like this, it takes a reality check to say, \u2018No, there\u2019s not enough being done if we want to see that continued gain,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd these organizations are doing, I think, important work, but they need additional help. They need additional funds. They need additional capacity, and they need the party and the party leaders themselves to support the type of work that they\u2019re doing, so that they can see gains across the board.\u201d",
      "The stalled progress for women in Congress is also in part because both parties\u2019 pickups were largely won by men.",
      "In the House, just two of the Democrats\u2019 seven flips were in districts with female candidates: Oregon\u2019s Janelle Bynum (who defeated a Republican woman) and New York\u2019s Laura Gillen. None of the House Republicans\u2019 seven flips were by female candidates.",
      "In the Senate, the three GOP Senate pickups in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana that sealed the Republican majority were also won by male candidates.",
      "After Trump\u2019s first election in 2016, Democrats did see a surge in women running for Congress in 2018, and a wave of Republican women stepped up to run two years later in 2020. It\u2019s too early to know whether the 2026 midterms will see similar increases from women of either party.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen before, at least, that women were motivated to step up when they felt that sense of threat and the perception that like it has to be now, because we can\u2019t wait,\u201d Dittmar said."

      "The Summary",
      "A newly identified chemical byproduct may be present in drinking water in about a third of U.S. homes, a study found.Scientists do not yet know whether the byproduct is dangerous.But some are worried that it could have toxic properties because of similarities to other chemicals of concern.",
      "A newly identified chemical byproduct may be present in drinking water in about a third of U.S. homes, a study found.",
      "Scientists do not yet know whether the byproduct is dangerous.",
      "But some are worried that it could have toxic properties because of similarities to other chemicals of concern.",
      "About a third of U.S. residents have been receiving tap water containing a previously unidentified chemical byproduct,\u00a0a new study has found. Some scientists are now concerned \u2014\u00a0and actively investigating \u2014 whether that chemical could be toxic.",
      "The newly identified substance, named \u201cchloronitramide anion,\u201d is produced when water is treated with chloramine, a chemical formed by mixing chlorine and ammonia. Chloramine is often used to kill viruses and bacteria in municipal water treatment systems.",
      "Researchers said the existence of the byproduct was discovered about 40 years ago, but it was only identified now because analysis techniques have improved, which finally enabled scientists to determine the chemical\u2019s structure.",
      "It could take years to figure out whether chloronitramide anion is dangerous \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s never been studied. The researchers reported their findings Thursday in the journal Science, in part to spur research to address safety concerns.",
      "The scientists said they have no hard evidence to suggest that the compound represents a danger, but that it bears similarities to other chemicals of concern. They think it deserves scrutiny because it\u2019s been detected so widely.",
      "\u201cIt has similarity to other toxic molecules,\u201d said David Wahman, one of the study\u2019s authors and a research environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWe looked for it in 40 samples in 10 U.S. chlorinated drinking water systems located in seven states. We did find it in all the samples.\u201d",
      "Chloronitramide anion is produced as chloramine decays over time. It\u2019s likely to be found in all drinking water treated via this method, he said.",
      "The fact that a byproduct with unknown risks could be so ubiquitous and evade researchers for so long renews questions about potential health effects of the chemicals used to treat tap water.",
      "Some 113 million U.S. residents receive chloramine-treated water from their taps, according to the study. The chemical has been used for about a century to disinfect water. Today, it\u2019s often used to protect a system\u2019s \u201cresidual\u201d \u2014 the water that remains in pipes for several days after it leaves a water treatment plant.",
      "Increasingly, chloramine has been favored over chlorine because the latter also produces byproducts, some of which are associated with bladder cancer and are regulated by the EPA.",
      "David Reckhow, a research professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved with the study, said the finding was an important step. The ultimate goal, he said, is understanding whether the substance is a hazard; he concurred that it was likely toxic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty small molecule and it can probably for that reason enter into biological systems and into cells. And it is still a reactive molecule,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the kinds of things you worry about.\u201d",
      "The authors of the new study arrived at their results after figuring out how to formulate high concentrations of the chemical for laboratory testing, said Julian Fairey, lead author and an associate professor at the University of Arkansas.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the toxicity but this study has enabled us to be able to do that work now,\u201d said Fairey, who studies drinking water byproducts. \u201cNow, we can go about the hard work of trying to figure out what its toxicological relevance is in our water systems.\u201d",
      "He added that some past studies have suggested a link between drinking disinfected water and increased rates of certain cancers.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving these. We have no idea if this compound is in any way related to those outcomes,\u201d Fairey said. \u201cBut we have unexplained incidents of certain types of cancer from treated drinking water.\u201d",
      "However, any conclusions about whether the newly identified substance is toxic are likely many years away. Potential regulation based on those eventual findings would take even longer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot \u2014 probably a decade of research once a funding source is found,\u201d said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.",
      "Reckhow said that in the meantime, water utilities should pay close attention to ongoing research and try to reduce people\u2019s exposure.",
      "\u201cYou do what you can to minimize,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make the best judgment you can on the toxicity and you run with incomplete information. That\u2019s the world we live in, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "The EPA only regulates a handful of disinfectant byproducts, including several associated with the use of chlorine. Scientists said those regulations have pushed some water providers to increase the use of chloramine.",
      "\u201cThis study really calls into question whether or not this disinfection process is safer from a health perspective,\u201d said David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that pushes for more scrutiny of chemicals.",
      "He added that there are hundreds of disinfection byproducts found in water systems but that this one deserves scrutiny.",
      "\u201cMany of those other contaminants are occurring at lower concentrations or less frequently,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Any treatment of drinking water involves some level of health risk, Roberson said. It\u2019s a trade-off: Disinfection processes have largely vanquished waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, but research suggests that some byproducts are associated with risks of cancer and miscarriage.",
      "\u201cThe reason you\u2019re adding the chloramine \u2014 you want to kill the bacteria and viruses, you have a real risk-risk trade-off,\u201d he said.",
      "Many U.S. water utilities disclose on their websites whether they treat the water they supply with chlorine or chloramine. Wahman said some research suggests that active carbon filters, such as those used in home water purification devices or refrigerator filters, can remove disinfectant byproducts but that more research is needed."

Frank Baum\u2019s 1900 novel \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\u201d Baum's book inspired the 1939 classic starring Judy Garland, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",

      "What happens in \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019?",
      "In the 1939 movie, Dorothy Gale (Garland) is a orphaned young woman growing up on her aunt and uncle\u2019s farm during the Dust Bowl, and dreams of escaping \u201cover the rainbow\u201d someday.",
      "She runs away when a local woman\u2019s complaint that Dorothy\u2019s dog Toto bit her means the dog must be put down. Convinced to return home by a traveling fortune-teller called Professor Marvel, Dorothy arrives mid-tornado and is hit in the head. The house appears to lift into the storm\u2019s funnel \u2014 depositing her in a new world.",
      "Dorothy is delighted by the local Munchkins of Munchkinland but enveloped in a tragedy: Her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and her sister the Wicked Witch of the West vows vengeance. The Wicked Witch of the West also wants the pair of shoes the Good Witch of the North has gifted Dorothy from the dead witch.",
      "Desiring only to get home, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road to visit Emerald City and the Wizard, who she hears holds the key to her return home.",
      "Along the way, she makes friends with The Scarecrow (who wants a brain); the Tin Man (who wants a heart); and the Cowardly Lion (who wants courage).",
      "After several adventures, they meet the Wizard (or at least, a giant floating green head with a booming voice that scares them) who says he\u2019ll give them all what they want if they bring them the Witch\u2019s broomstick, proving she\u2019s dead.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 end?",
      "Dorothy and Toto are first captured by the Witch\u2019s flying monkeys, but freed by their companions, only to be chased by the Witch and her guards. When the Witch sets the Scarecrow\u2019s arm on fire, Dorothy splashes him with water \u2014 that also lands on the Witch, melting her.",
      "They bring the broomstick to the Wizard, who tries to dodge their requests, until Toto reveals a man behind a curtain who\u2019s operating all the special effects. He offers to take her home in the hot air balloon that brought him to Oz, but Dorothy misses her flight while chasing Toto and seems stuck in Oz.",
      "Then, Glinda reveals an even easier way back to Kansas: Dorothy can click her heels together and wish to be home. After some fond farewells, Dorothy invokes the shoe spell and she and Toto go home.",
      "But did they ever leave? Dorothy wakes in her own bed, surrounded by farmhands who look like the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Everyone insists she had a vivid dream. Dorothy is just happy to be home and discovers the film\u2019s true meaning: That home is the best place of all.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 connect to \u2018Wicked\u2019?",
      "Throughout \u201cWicked,\u201d characters and scenes often contain touchstones from the 1939 movie, starting with that hat on the water and the Witch\u2019s killers marching off to Emerald City.",
      "But not everything connects \u2026 yet. Elphaba doesn\u2019t start off so wicked in \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d for example. She\u2019s actually tormented for her green skin (sure, Oz is a magic world but there are some things the locals really don\u2019t tolerate).",
      "Galinda doesn\u2019t start out particularly good, either; she\u2019s self-absorbed and self-assured to the point of annoyance. But colors are significant here: Just like in \u201cOz,\u201d Elphaba is green, and Galinda/Glinda is as pink as Barbie (and travels in her own literal bubble).",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d Elphaba does have a sister, but we never see anything of that sister in \u201cOz\u201d except for her legs sticking out from under the house. Nessarose's shoes (Marissa Bode) in \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d aren't ruby \u2014 they\u2019re bedazzled and silvery (much like in Baum's \u201cWonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and Maguire's \u201cWicked\u201d).",
      "There are other shout-outs to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) enlists Elphaba and Galinda to help him decide on a color for a super-sidewalk that will thread throughout Oz that he\u2019s building (yellow, naturally, wins).",
      "Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) joins Elphaba and Galinda at school and helps Elphaba rescue a lion cub \u2014 it\u2019s not directly stated in the film, but there\u2019s a good chance that cub\u2019s going to have a connection to being cowardly someday.",
      "Then there are some confusing moments. For a woman who should have discovered by now that water can hurt her, Elphaba is quite unbothered by it in \u201cPart One,\u201d going so far as to dance on flagstones that cross a stream at the school. Surely there\u2019s more to learn about this seeming inconsistency in \u201cPart Two.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart One\u201d also underscores the poppy as a significant flower: They\u2019re the favorites of a professor at Shiz University who Elphaba takes a shine to. At one point, she releases a spell that causes the flowers\u2019 scent to knock out nearly everyone in the classroom. This is a direct reference to a scene in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d where Wicked Elphaba creates a field of poppies to slow down Dorothy and her friends on their way to Emerald City.",
      "Of course, there are still more reveals to come in \u201cPart Two,\u201d currently slated for theaters on Nov. 26, 2025. Until then, keep following the yellow brick road!"

      "Throughout the course of her memoir, Cher explains she always knew something was wrong with her, and she especially struggled in school as a child.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until later in life that she got some answers about herself when her first kid, Chaz Bono, was diagnosed as dyslexic by specialists during childhood.",
      "\u201cWhen I read some of the literature they sent me about dyslexia, I thought, Oh s---. That\u2019s me,\u201d Cher writes in her book about the moment she found out about her child\u2019s diagnosis.",
      "She says she had \u201cnever even heard the word\u201d until Chaz\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cBut it explained so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like an old mystery had finally been solved, left over from my childhood,\u201d she adds, noting that \u201cthe difference was that there were systems in place to help\u201d her child that \u201cwere never available\u201d to her.",
      "Cher told Smith she does have a creative solution in the event she ever needs to look up her phone number.",

      "Ball has a special history with Cher. Cher recalls in her memoir attending an election results party, hosted by Jack Benny, in 1972 with the TV star.",
      "Cher explains she didn\u2019t want to be at the party and writes that \u201cLucille was clearly bored too, because as the votes started coming in she began making wisecracks about the \u2018windbags\u2019 giving commentary on what each update meant.\u201d",
      "She was taken by Ball\u2019s antics.",
      "\u201cI had known her since I was little, but this night she got me in trouble. I couldn\u2019t help but giggle at her commentary,\u201d she writes.",
      "\u201cShe was being so funny and irreverent. If you knew Lucy, she was a balls-to-the-wall kick-ass chick, not taking anything from anybody,\u201d she adds.",
      "Eventually, her giggles annoyed her then-husband, Sonny Bono, and party guest Johnny Carson.",
      "Cher says that Carson \u201ccomplained to Jack Benny\u2019s wife about the disturbance,\u201d and she was confident Ball would get in trouble.",
      "\u201cThen I realized that nobody was going to say a word to her because she\u2019d have neutered them. Everyone was terrified of Lucy,\u201d Cher writes. \u201cI, however, was a different thing altogether. Like a naughty child, I was banished to the den.\u201d",
      "Not long after, Cher looked to Ball when she needed advice about how to leave Bono. She decided to give Ball a call since the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d star had been in a similar situation and eventually divorced her TV co-star, Desi Arnaz.",
      "\u201cI told her, \u2018Lucy, I want to leave Sonny and you\u2019re the only one I know that\u2019s ever been in this same situation. What should I do?\u2019 Lucy and her husband had also become famous working together as stars on TV. And he was a huge womanizer too. Then Lucy had left him. She told me, \u2018F--- him, you\u2019re the one with the talent,\u2019\u201d she writes.",
      "Cher and Bono did eventually divorce in 1975, and she went on to marry Gregg Allman shortly thereafter. She and Allman welcomed a son together, Elijah Blue, in 1976 and divorced a few years later."

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "How does the Gladiator sequel connect to the first Gladiator? Here's what to remember from the first Gladiator including how Lucius is related to Maximus.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s been nearly 25 years, but the Oscar-winning \u201cGladiator\u201d is back! Or, at least, a sequel is!",
      "True, \"Gladiator\" star Russell Crowe can\u2019t return as Maximus (for obvious reasons), but \u201cGladiator II\u201d \u00a0is packed full of nostalgia, familiar characters and callbacks to the 2000 film.",
      "It\u2019s also stuffed with much of the spectacle that made the first film such a success: brutal fights with animals and humans in the Coliseum, political intrigue, class warfare and a hero who fights with determined purpose.",
      "So what do we need to know about this sword-and-sandals epic before it opens wide on Nov. 22? Here's what to know.",
      "Note: Light spoilers are included regarding both films.",
      "Do you need to watch \u2018Gladiator\u2019 to follow along with \u2018Gladiator II\u2019?",
      "Not necessarily, but it helps. The key fact of the film: That Maximus had a son who ends up in the arena, and leading a revolt is already part of the early trailers.",
      "But it\u2019s not critical, because the film makes liberal use of flashbacks to the previous film to help fill in the blanks.",
      "What is Lucius\u2019 connection to the first \u2018Gladiator\u2019?",
      "In \u201cGladiator,\u201d Lucius is an incidental character.",
      "Played by Spencer Treat Clark, the boy is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and it\u2019s stated that his father is Lucilla\u2019s late husband, Lucius Verus (Lucius\u2019 namesake).",
      "Lucilla, by the way, is the sister of the leader in the first film, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).",
      "But we also learn in that film that Lucilla had an on-again, off-again relationship with Maximus, so it\u2019s not a huge surprise to discover that the script for \u201cII\u201d has retconned Lucius (Paul Mescal) into being a more significant player: that is, Maximus\u2019 son.",
      "For his safety, the boy Lucius is shown to being spirited away and raised elsewhere \u2014 when he finally meets Lucilla in \u201cII,\u201d he claims to barely remember her.",
      "Who from the original \u2018Gladiator\u2019 appears?",
      "Aside from the actors in the flashbacks, there are two key performers who show up in \u201cII\u201d \u2014 Nielsen, who has remarried the man Lucius blames for murdering his family, Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) \u2014 and Derek Jacobi, who plays Senator Graccus. In \u201cGladiator,\u201d he was part of the plot with Maximus and Lucilla to overthrow Commodus.",
      "And technically, Ridley Scott is also a return from the original \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 as the director of both films. He was nominated for best director in 2001, so maybe he\u2019s hoping to win that Oscar this time around.",
      "How does Maximus play a part in the new film?",
      "In a way, he\u2019s everywhere. Adult Lucius doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Maximus\u2019 son, and he\u2019s worshiped the warrior all these years.",
      "There are several callbacks that suggest their connection before it\u2019s stated explicitly: The image of Maximus running his hand through wheat field grasses shows up early on, and when Lucius is in the arena he sticks his sword in the ground, leans down and runs sand through his hands \u2014 just like his father did.",
      "Then, during \u201cGladiator,\u201d Maximus has a maxim he loves to share: \u201cWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\" The aphorism makes an appearance in \u201cII\u201d to lend it depth and scope.",
      "But the biggest contribution Maximus makes to the film (Lucius aside) comes when his son visits a tomb beneath the arena and is given his father\u2019s armor and sword for a big challenge.",
      "Who\u2019s been maintaining that all these years? How does it look so shiny and spiffy? Why does it naturally fit Lucius perfectly? These things can all be answered by whispering the name of a distant, future land far from Rome \u2026 Hollywood."

      "But is \"Wicked\" \u2014 which follows the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 also family-friendly?",
      "\"Wicked\" was rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested, and some material may not be suitable for young children.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the kid-friendliness of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Is 'Wicked' for kids?",
      "Yes, \"Wicked\" is for kids, director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com.",
      "Chu says two of his five children, age 7 and 5, have seen \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy 3-year-old did not see it yet, but I\u2019m going to bring her,\u201d he adds.",
      "\"Wicked\" is rated PG for \"some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\"",
      "For parents of young kids, Chu notes: Beware the flying monkeys.",
      "Toward the end of \"Wicked,\" viewers learn the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West's famous henchman, her flying monkeys. Instead of costumed actors like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" uses computer-generated imagery for the monkeys (and all the other animals in the film, including a lion cub, bear and goat).",
      "Chu says the monkeys are \"definitely not as creepy\" as they were in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, a Washington Post review of the film argues the flying monkeys are more terrifying with CGI, warning parents, \"this is not a movie for very young children.\"",
      "As for thematic and brief suggestive material, the film does feature some romance. There's an onscreen kiss and an implied sexual encounter in one of the film's first scenes.",
      "What age is 'Wicked' appropriate for?",
      "Common Sense Media rates the film as appropriate for kids aged 10 and up, citing \"(light) jump-scares\" involving the flying monkeys, the Wizard of Oz's giant avatar head and the bullying Cynthia Erivo's character Elphaba experiences.",
      "The film is also long, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes in the theater, not including any previews.",
      "The original Broadway musical that the film is based on is recommended for children age 8 and up, and children under 5 years old are not admitted, according to the \"Wicked\" musical's website. The 1995 book that inspired the musical, Gregory Maguire's  \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch,\" is not for children and includes swearing, sex, violence and more mature themes.",
      "Chu overall describes his 2024 \u201cWicked\u201d film as \u201caccessible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about a relationship, and that relationship is nuanced \u2014 we\u2019ll see if kids pick that up,\u201d Chu says, referring to the complex friendship between Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande).",
      "\u201cI think they will fall in love with this friendship and this world. And there\u2019s a lot of things to look at and be enamored by,\u201d Chu says. \u201cBut in the end, I think they will love these two friends. And I think as a young person, when you\u2019re meeting new friends, I think that all connects with them, too.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:27:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Cher, who was previously married to Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, reveals during a book talk about her memoir she should've dated singer Michael McDonald.",
    "story": [
      "Cher\u2019s famous relationships are nearly as iconic as her career in the entertainment industry, and both topics are extensively covered in her just-released book, \u201cCher: The Memoir, Part One.\u201d But there\u2019s one man she \u201cwould\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve\u201d taken a chance on and didn\u2019t.",
      "During a conversation about her new book with friend and former NBC News correspondent Harry Smith Nov. 20 at New York City\u2019s Temple Emanu-El, Cher answered a question that Smith threw out there \u201cjust for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre there men in your life,\u201d Smith began, \u201cwas there ever a man, and this is not in the book \u2014 this is just for fun \u2014 a man that you said, \u2018Would\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve\u2019?\u201d",
      "The crowd ooohed, and the singer responded, \u201cMichael McDonald.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would have gone out with him for his voice,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf he just would sing to me, I would just love it.\u201d",
      "Cher also recalled the Doobie Brothers musician was once on the road with her and that she did background vocals just to be on the same stage with him.",
      "\u201cWhy is it, you think, that men always fall in love with you?\u201d Smith asked.",
      "\u201cHow can you not?\u201d someone in the audience said.",
      "\u201cLook at her!\u201d another screamed.",
      "Cher was married to Sonny Bono until the two divorced in 1975, and she tied the knot with Gregg Allman days after her first divorce was finalized. The two also had their fair share of issues, including Allman's battle with addiction, and divorced a few years after their wedding. She also dated music executive David Geffen and Kiss rocker Gene Simmons. She reflects on all of the relationships in her memoir.",
      "More recently, she\u2019s been linked to music executive Alexander \u201cAE\u201d Edwards.",
      "In response to Smith\u2019s question, Cher was a little shy.",
      "\u201cShould I just say all this stuff? It sounds so \u2014\u201d she started, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a really good girlfriend, and I learned how to do this.\u201d",
      "The 78-year-old also described herself as \u201creally funny\u201d and \u201csweet-ish.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m monogamous,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I know that if I look at a man while I\u2019m with my boyfriend, it\u2019s over, because I don\u2019t look at men. I don\u2019t see men. If I\u2019m with someone that I love, the moment I see a boy it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, goodbye!\u2019 But no, I\u2019m a really good girlfriend.\u201d",
      "That habit is one that was instilled in Cher early on, as detailed in her memoir, when she writes multiple times about Bono not allowing her to interact with other men. In one instance, she recalled when he burned her tennis clothes after finding out from a friend she went to a party after one of her tennis lessons and was seen talking to some men.",
      "\u201cI was so pissed off at that,\u201d Cher said while telling the story to Smith.",
      "While grappling with the decision to leave Bono, Cher called friend Lucille Ball, who divorced her famous husband and TV partner, Desi Arnaz, for advice.",
      "In her book, Cher wrote, \u201cI told her, \u2018Lucy, I want to leave Sonny and you\u2019re the only one I know that\u2019s ever been in this same situation. What should I do?\u2019\u201d",
      "The singer said Ball responded, \u201cF--- him, you\u2019re the one with the talent.\u201d",
      "Cher also shared another fun tidbit with fans during her book talk about Ball.",
      "\u201cI want to tell you something that\u2019s really embarrassing, though,\u201d the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer said to Smith.",
      "She explained that because she has dyslexia, she doesn\u2019t know her address or phone number.",
      "\u201cIf people want to find me, they will,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have my mobile. If I want to know what my phone number is, I just click to \u2018Lucille Ball.\u2019 That\u2019s what my name is,\u201d she revealed.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not in the book,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s good stuff.\u201d"

So, he was in denial,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explains. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we don\u2019t want to think those things of our children, but when it comes to Stephen, he is completely submissive to his wife\u2019s version of reality.\u201d",
      "As for whether or not Nancy knew about Jonathan\u2019s violent nature? Cuar\u00f3n says, \u201cI would almost be certain of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Nancy\u2019s impulse to write \u2018The Perfect Stranger\u2019 was a way for her to protect her son and change the narrative of her son,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks to the book, she could turn her son into this naive, heroic, romantic figure, which is very different from the reality.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas die?",
      "At the beginning of \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Stephen makes it clear that he published his wife\u2019s book, \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d simply to torture Catherine. He wants her closest friends and family members to know the part that she played in Jonathan\u2019s death.",
      "Stephen creates a complicated catfishing scheme to tell Nicholas his role in the story. Distraught by his mother\u2019s representation in the novel, Nicholas overdoses and ends up unconscious in the hospital.",
      "Once in the hospital, Stephen tries to kill Nicholas by injecting him with an unknown substance. However, Catherine stops him just in time.",
      "He then tries again once he spikes Catherine\u2019s tea, which puts her into a deep slumber. At the hospital, Stephen tries to give Nicholas the deadly injection, but he stops once he sympathizes with a confused Nicholas, who is calling out for his mom.",
      "What does Stephen see in the photograph?",
      "After the truth comes out about Jonathan, Stephen then decides to burn all the explicit photos that his son took of Catherine on the night he raped her.",
      "As he places the photos into the fire, Stephen sees a small but important detail he missed \u2014 Nicholas was there in the room when Catherine got assaulted.",
      "A photograph shows a young Nicholas looking on at his mother from the reflection in the mirror. It\u2019s at that moment that Stephen realizes his journey for retribution hurt more people than he realized.",
      "\u201cRevenge and retribution are just going to end up in the same way because it\u2019s just like the saying \u2014 \u2018He who seeks revenge should dig two graves,\u2019\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "At the end of the show, Catherine opens up to Nicholas about what happened to her in Italy. Nicholas starts crying and says he doesn\u2019t remember the trip or that she was raped. While feeling remorseful, he hugs his mother and they both take the opportunity to get to know one another better on a clean slate.",
      "\u201cVery often, we don\u2019t remember traumatic episodes that we witness. But the fact that we don\u2019t remember them doesn\u2019t mean that they are not stored inside us and come out in different behaviors. This is shown with Nicholas and his addictive behaviors,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cDisclaimer\u201d ends with Catherine rebuilding her bond with her son. After putting her career first for many years, she decides to focus on Nicholas and mending their once strained relationship."

      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

      "On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found.",
      "Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. \u201cFrom the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,\u201d she said.",
      "The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought in through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were stolen near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",

      "The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",

      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "All travel between the U.S. and Haiti, including much-needed aid operations, continues to be impacted by a 30-day ban imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, after gunfire struck a Spirit Airlines plane as it attempted to land in Port-au-Prince.",
      "Linda Thelemaque regularly travels to the southern city of Les Cayes in her role as chief program officer of Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that helps combat poverty. She said the inability to fly in supplies has created a logistical nightmare in the Caribbean nation, where gang violence already makes ground transportation between cities nearly impossible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with severe challenges due to gang violence, which has essentially cut off ground transportation,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cNow, with flights canceled, we\u2019re facing increased costs and delays in delivering essential supplies, including $10 million worth of medication.\u201d",
      "Thelemaque had planned to travel to Haiti for work on Nov. 19, but her flight was canceled. \u201cAlthough the FAA says the ban will lift on Dec. 12, most airlines are rescheduling flights for February,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA ban has also complicated humanitarian aid efforts. \u201cWe rely on Sunrise Airways to transport supplies from Port-au-Prince to the south, but with flights grounded, we\u2019re forced to explore expensive alternatives, like chartering flights or seeking humanitarian exemptions,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, American Airlines said it had suspended its daily flights between Miami and Port-au-Prince until Feb. 12, 2025 after a separate incident involving flight 819 from Port-au-Prince to Miami last week. While the flight landed safely in Miami with no reported injuries, a post-flight inspection revealed that a bullet had struck the aircraft\u2019s exterior.",
      "Before the FAA\u2019s ban announcement, the U.S. State Department had issued an advisory to avoid traveling to Haiti due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.\u201d The department noted that airports and people traveling by car had become targets for violence.",
      "In March, escalating gang violence and unrest reached a boiling point as the Caribbean nation\u2019s government fell apart. Armed groups took over the streets, disrupting life for many residents across Port-au-Prince and driving up the cost of fuel and basic goods. \u201cPrices are being passed on to consumers, making daily survival increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, said the country\u2019s ongoing crisis has taken an emotional toll on Haitians living in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe may be physically far from Haiti, but we remain deeply connected,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are consumed by the news of worsening violence and are mourning senseless killings.\u201d",
      "The flight ban is also disrupting long-standing holiday traditions in this mostly Catholic and Christian country. Jan. 1 also holds special significance beyond New Year\u2019s Day, as it is also Haitian Independence Day and celebrated with parades, fireworks and dancing..",
      "\u201cMany Haitians save their vacations for December to reconnect with loved ones,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, that opportunity has been taken away.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that the ban extends beyond Port-au-Prince to airports throughout the country, further isolating Haitians. \u201cEven during ongoing crises, people could travel to Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes. Now the whole country feels shut down,\u201d she said.",
      "Another way to enter Haiti is by crossing through the Dominican Republic, with whom it shares the island. Haitian passport-holders with U.S. permanent residency often traveled through the DR but the country has closed its borders with Haiti due to the violence.",
      "\u201cEven if a flight diverts to the Dominican Republic, Haitian passport-holders are denied entry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSome passengers have had to return to Europe or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The U.N. reported that more than 20,000 people fled their homes in Port-au-Prince in a four-day span in November and settled in smaller cities. This has strained resources in cities like Les Cayes.",
      "\u201cThe influx of displaced residents is overwhelming clinics and creating mistrust between locals and newcomers,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Williams emphasized the growing mental health crisis in Haiti, citing a recent survey by Haitian-led organizations. \u201cThe constant trauma of gang violence is taking a toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "Even those in less-affected areas remain under stress, she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes, you worry about being next,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe trauma is pervasive, and the travel ban only adds to that stress.\u201d",
      "Both Thelemaque and Williams agree that the FAA ban, while necessary for safety, underscores the urgent need to address Haiti\u2019s escalating crisis.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to adapt,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s securing humanitarian exemptions or finding new supply routes, the people we serve rely on us.\u201d",
      "Williams called for continued advocacy. \u201cThe diaspora wants to help, but the barriers are immense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must address not only the immediate needs but also the root causes of this violence.\u201d"

      "Putin this week lowered the bar for his country\u2019s use of a nuclear weapon, a move that was dismissed by Western officials as the latest instance of Russian saber rattling in the war, which has now lasted more than 1,000 days.",
      "'Using Ukraine as a training ground'",
      "The Ukrainian air force said early Thursday that the alleged ICBM was launched from the Caspian Sea region of Astrakhan in southern Russia at Dnipro, but did not specify exactly what model of missile was used.",
      "In a statement posted on Telegram, the air force said that Moscow had also attacked Dnipro with various other missiles. It said that Russian aircraft had fired an air-launched ballistic missile and seven cruise missiles, and that Ukrainian forces had shot down six cruise missiles.",
      "Serhii Lysak, the head of the regional authority, said on Telegram that two people were injured in the attack on Dnipro. Meanwhile, 15 people were injured in a separate attack on the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, local authorities said.",
      "The claim was quickly disputed by a Western official, who said it was a ballistic missile but not an ICBM that was fired. The Western official declined to further characterize the missile that was used, adding that its impact was still being assessed.",
      "A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the reports \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d but added that intelligence services were still looking into them.",
      "\u201cIf true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behavior from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to reflect the uncertainty.",
      "Speaking in a video posted on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that \u201ctoday, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom, and people\u2019s lives in general... he is so afraid that he is already using new missiles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a training ground,\u201d he  added, saying that that the speed and altitude of the missile that Russian forces launched suggested that it was an ICBM, but that investigations were now underway.",
      "Analysts urged caution in interpreting Thursday's claim by Kyiv.",
      "Using such a missile \u201cin a conventional role does not make a lot of sense because of their relatively low accuracy and high cost. But this kind of a strike might have a value as a signal,\u201d nuclear forces expert Pavel Podvig said.",
      "\u201cI would urge people to keep calm, not assume automatically that \u201cintercontinental\u201d is something inherently and immediately dangerous. But it should be taken seriously,\u201d Podvig, a senior researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, said in a post on X.",
      "Putin on Tuesday formally revised his country\u2019s nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document detailing the conditions under which Moscow would consider using nuclear weapons \u2014 with the change justifying a nuclear strike by Russia if attacked by a nonnuclear country that is supported by a nuclear state.",
      "Ultimately, analysts say, the likelihood of the Kremlin opting to use nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine is very slim \u2014 particularly now, when its military is advancing and its opponent is worn down.",
      "Russian forces have seized the momentum in recent months and eked out a succession of territorial gains, particularly on the eastern front lines. They have also been bolstered by thousands of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's troops in their quest to retake occupied land in Russia's Kursk border region.",
      "The West relaxing restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons may boost Kyiv but will likely do little to transform the battlefield situation, analysts said, despite the dire nature of the Kremlin's rhetorical reaction.",
      "\u201cAt this stage in the war, the risk of Russian nuclear use is lower than before. Political and battlefield developments favor Russia, so there is little to gain by escalating the conflict to the nuclear level,\u201d said Alexander Bollfrass, head of strategy, technology and arms control at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.",
      "In addition to the unclear military benefits of deploying those weapons, there would also be diplomatic drawbacks.",
      "\u201cNuclear weapons use would risk alienating China and other non-Western countries whose support or neutrality is key to maintaining the Russian war economy,\u201d Bollfrass told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cIt would also get the relationship with the incoming Trump administration off to a very dangerous start.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Iceland\u2019s capital erupted late on Wednesday for the seventh time in a year, spewing fountains of lava and smoke, the country\u2019s meteorological office said, but there were no disruptions to air traffic or infrastructure.",
      "The eruption started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. local time Wednesday and created a fissure just under two miles long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity said.",
      "Social media livestreams from the area showed glowing hot lava in bright yellow and orange shades shooting up into the night sky.",
      "The first signs of an eruption were recorded just 45 minutes before a massive ground fissure was opened by magma forcing its way through the earth\u2019s crust, Iceland\u2019s meteorological office said.",
      "Authorities had previously warned of volcanic activity as magma accumulated beneath the Reykjanes peninsula, some 20 miles southwest of the capital Reykjavik, where the most recent eruption ended only on Sept. 6. However, there had been no noticeable increase in seismic activity in recent weeks, the meteorological office said.",
      "\u201cIn the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told the national RUV broadcaster.",
      "The outbreaks on the Reykjanes peninsula, known as fissure eruptions, have not directly affected the capital city and do not cause significant dispersals of ash into the stratosphere, avoiding air traffic disruption.",
      "Reykjavik\u2019s Keflavik Airport said on its website that flights were unaffected and no crucial infrastructure was in danger, but the Blue Lagoon, a luxury geothermal spa resort, had shut down and evacuated its guests, RUV said.",
      "The nearby fishing town of\u00a0Grindavik, home to nearly 4,000 residents before an evacuation order in December last year, remains mostly deserted due to the periodic threat from lava flows.",
      "There was no indication that lava was flowing towards the town, but some 50 houses occupied by people who have returned were evacuated, the civil protection agency said in a statement.",
      "\u201cGrindav\u00edk is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi said.",
      "Iceland, with its 400,000 inhabitants, sits above a\u00a0volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic and averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",
      "Lying dormant for 800 years, the geological systems in the area reactivated in 2021 and have since erupted at rising frequency, with the latest outbreak being\u00a0the sixth\u00a0so far in 2024.",
      "Experts have warned that Reykjanes is likely to experience repeated volcanic outbreaks for decades, possibly even centuries."

      "Officials in Boli County in China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang said in a statement that a villager was bitten on the left hand Monday morning. The man\u2019s injury was so severe that he required a four-hour limb-salvage surgery to avoid amputation, according to state media People\u2019s Daily.",

A specialist task force has now been dispatched to assist the local government in managing the incident, it added.",
      "Liu Dan, chief engineer of the Hengdaohezi Feline Breeding and Research Center in Heilongjiang, said Wednesday that the tiger who bit the villager may still be in the area, according to state television network CCTV.",

      "Anyone injured in Heilongjiang by wild Siberian tigers is eligible for economic compensation, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park said in a statement. The park added that the village where the incident took place is over 120 miles away from the park and is therefore outside its management.",

      "Dubbed an old-school political \u201cbruiser\u201d and a proud trade unionist, he famously punched a member of the public during an election campaign in 2001, after he had been pelted with an egg.",
      "\u201cI was just thinking this morning about the time ... when someone smashed an egg on his head and he turned around and he punched the guy and laid him out ... There were no rules that he really abided by,\u201d Blair said.",

      "One cable running between Sweden and Lithuania\u00a0was cut\u00a0on Sunday and another one between Finland and Germany was severed less than 24 hours later on Monday.",
      "The breaches happened in Sweden\u2019s exclusive economic zone and Swedish prosecutors started a preliminary investigation on Tuesday on suspicion of possible sabotage.",
      "Swedish Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told Reuters on Tuesday that the country\u2019s armed forces and coastguard had picked up ship movements that corresponded with the interruption of two telecoms cables in the Baltic Sea.",
      "A Chinese government spokesperson told a daily news briefing on Wednesday that it always required its vessels to abide by relevant laws and regulations.",
      "\u201cWe also attach great importance to the protection of seabed infrastructure and, together with the international community, we are actively promoting the construction and protection of submarine cables and other global information infrastructures,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Russia dismissed on Wednesday any suggestion that it had been involved in damaging the two cables.",
      "European governments accused Russia on Tuesday of escalating hybrid attacks on Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, but stopped short of directly accusing Russia of destroying the cables.",
      "Asked about the matter on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing: \u201cIt is quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any reason.\u201d"

      "Over three years after the accidental on-set death of cinematographer\u00a0Halyna Hutchins,\u00a0Alec Baldwin's Western film \u201cRust\u201d received a polite response during its controversial premiere Wednesday at the EnergaCamerimage festival in Toru\u0144, Poland.",
      "The audience clapped through the film\u2019s closing credits, strengthening their applause when a\u00a0dedication to Hutchins\u00a0appeared. However, a fair amount of moviegoers left the theater before the credits ended and prior to a Q&A with director Joel Souza \u2014 who was also injured in the October 2021 gun accident that took place while filming in New Mexico \u2014 and cinematographer Bianca Cline, who completed the movie.",
      "Producer and star Alec Baldwin \u2014 who was handling the prop gun at the time of the accident \u2014 was not invited to attend the festival, according to an event spokesperson. Baldwin was charged with manslaughter but the case was\u00a0dismissed\u00a0on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to turn over evidence.",
      "Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey \u2014 who is\u00a0suing the production and Baldwin\u00a0\u2014 also didn\u2019t attend, nor did the cinematographer\u2019s husband, Matthew Hutchins, who was named an executive producer on \u201cRust\u201d as part of the settlement agreement.",
      "The premiere opened with\u00a0Camerimage\u00a0director Marek \u017bydowicz asking the audience to stand for a moment of silence for Hutchins. Cinematographer Rachel Mason, Hutchins\u2019 friend who made a documentary about the completion of the film, then made an emotional speech.",
      "\u201cI feel strongly that I need to make a statement about a very misunderstood film and the people who made it, who I believe are heroic people,\u201d she said, underlining that the crew returned to set after the accident because of their dedication to and love for Hutchins.",
      "\u201cYou could just feel and see the trauma that they had gone through, like a war zone. And I was like, \u2018Why would you put yourself back into your most difficult emotional nightmare?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd every single person had the same response to me. When they learned that this film \u2018Rust\u2019 might help Halyna\u2019s family, they thought of one thing: the fact that she has a son, and that son doesn\u2019t get to have a mother anymore. And if they could do something for that little boy, then why would they not be there?\u201d",
      "Controversy erupted over the screening of \u201cRust\u201d at Camerimage when it was announced last month. \u017bydowicz\u00a0responded with a statement at that time, which said in part, \u201cThe sole purpose of this screening is to honor Halyna\u2019s work, talent, and artistic achievements \u2026 Our aim is to honor and fulfill the wishes of Halyna and her family. It was Halyna\u2019s dream to present\u00a0\u2018Rust\u2019\u00a0at EnergaCamerimage, and her family wishes for this to happen as well.\u201d",
      "Mason said she wishes she could \u201cknow what Halyna would really want\u201d when it came to the completion and premiere of \u201cRust.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut guess what? I can\u2019t ask her,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the past three years, I have been living in Halyna\u2019s brain for the 12 days that she was on the set of \u2018Rust\u2019 to understand: What did she see in this movie? Did she love this movie? What was she doing there?\u201d",
      "Souza and Cline then took to the stage to deliver their own heartfelt remarks.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s so amazing to see people supporting Halyna and what we finished together,\u201d Cline said. \u201cWhen you watch this film today, you\u2019ll be experiencing the world through Halyna\u2019s eyes. You\u2019ll get to experience her vision of the world and I hope all of you have that in your hearts too as you watch that today.\u201d",
      "Added Souza, \u201cWe are here in a place that she loved so much, probably second only to being on set. I want to thank you all for coming and for taking a few hours out of your day to come celebrate my friend and to celebrate her art and her talent. She really was something.\u201d",
      "Hutchins was an up-and-coming talent, with credits including 2020\u2019s \u201cArchenemy\u201d and \u201cBlindfire\u201d and 2019\u2019s \u201cDarlin.\u2019\u201d She was posthumously awarded honorary membership in the America Society of Cinematographers. Additionally, AFI launched the Halyna Hutchins Memorial Scholarship Fund.",
      "\u201cRust\u201d tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who, left to fend for himself and his younger brother following their parents\u2019 deaths in 1880s Wyoming, goes on the run with his long-estranged grandfather after he\u2019s sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher.",
      "In the aftermath of Hutchins\u2019 death, star and producer Baldwin, who was handling the prop gun at the time of the accident, was charged with manslaughter but the case was\u00a0dismissed\u00a0on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to turn over evidence.",
      "Following this decision, the defense for \u201cRust\u201d armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who is serving an 18-month sentence for Hutchins\u2019 death, asked for a new trial, but a judge denied the request and upheld the verdict."
