      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Aug 11, 4:59 AM",
      "Witcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.",
      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "\u201cLurker,\u201d a breakout film from the Sundance Film Festival, explores the dark side of celebrity and fandom",
      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

      "Often times Russell\u2019s friends in the music world would come around set, giving the off camera times a bit of a meta quality.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel a little like the movie sometimes, like just like a group of like young creatives,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cThere was a real LA film and music scene that was very present. That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important film for now,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cThe relationship that we have with people that we don\u2019t know? I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",

      "Jon Batiste\u2019s new album is titled \"Big Money.\"",
      "On \u201cBig Money,\u201d Super Bowl-sized singer Jon Batiste opts for a surprisingly intimate sound.",
      "The just over 32-minute, nine-song set will be released Friday, and it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the New Orleans' jazzman's eye-popping wardrobe. The stripped-down, mostly acoustic arrangements create a chill vibe. Simplicity somehow only intensifies the songs\u2019 swing and sway.",
      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
      "Also stellar is \u201cMaybe,\u201d a ballad filled with thick chords and questions about the big picture. \u201cOr maybe we should all just take a collective pause,\u201d Batiste sings, before launching into a keyboard exploration worthy of Jelly Roll Morton.",
      "The bouncy \u201cLean on My Love\u201d draws from Prince, Sly Stone and the Spinners as Batiste sings in unison with Andra Day. The equally buoyant title cut rhymes \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cdummy\u201d in a strummy sing-along that includes backing vocals by the Womack Sisters, granddaughters of soul singer Sam Cooke.",
      "\u201cPinnacle\u201d chooses a similar tempo to kick up Delta dust around a delightful word salad. \u201cHop scotch/Double Dutchie jumping rope/Twistin' it and ya wobble it/And let it go,\u201d he sings on one verse.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve decided that our plan is just to ignore inflation and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist,\" Arnold said. \u201cSo you still take a quarter out of your pocket and put it in a game, and you don\u2019t pay a resort fee or a cancelation fee or any of that jazz.\u201d",
      "But Arnold said he's not surprised overall tourism might be slowing because of skyrocketing prices at high-end restaurants and resorts, which \u201csqueezes out the low-end tourist.\u201d",

      "It happened Aug. 11, when Koz and fellow musicians on the Dave Koz & Friends Summer Horns Tour were headed to Seattle for two days of shows. What was supposed to be a direct flight was beset by delays, including having to divert to Boise, Idaho, after flight crew members timed out and needed to be relieved and the plane encountered a mechanical issue, Koz said Tuesday.",
      "This wasn't the first delay the band experienced since its tour started around mid-July, and it even had to cancel two shows because of travel-related issues, Koz said. But the delay last week was particularly deflating not just for the musicians but for everyone on the plane.",
      "\u201cYou could just feel the energy. Everybody was so frustrated,\u201d Koz said.",
      "A flight attendant who saw the musicians bring their instruments on board asked if they'd be willing to play a song while they were stuck in Boise.",

      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",

      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",
      "The London-born Stamp started his film career with 1962\u2019s seafaring \u201cBilly Budd,\u201d for which he earned Oscar and BAFTA award nominations.",

As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",

      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bill Duke, who starred with Stamp in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey,\u201d said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear of his death.",

      "Stamp started his acting career on stage in the late 1950s, where he acted in repertory theatre and met Michael Caine, who was five years older than himself. The pair lived together in a flat in central London while looking for their big break.",
      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "\u201cI worked with Olivier briefly on my second movie (1962\u2019s \u201cTerm of Trial\"),\u201d Stamp recalled in an interview with the AP in 2013. \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018You should always study your voice.\u2019\u201d Stamp then segued into a spot-on Olivier impersonation, continuing, \u201c\u2018Because, as you get older, your looks go, but your voice will become empowered.\u2019\u201d",
      "His career took a bit of a hiatus from the late 1960s after he missed out on the role of James Bond to replace Sean Connery, that included a years-long stint in India and which saw him embrace a more holistic approach to his self.",
      "It was the unexpected role of General Zod that brought him back to the limelight. He played John Tunstall in 1988's \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d the Galactic Republic leader in 1999's \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequel \u201cThe Phantom Menace,\u201d appeared in the comedies \u201cYes Man\u201d and \u201cGet Smart\u201d in 2008 and delivered voice performances in the video games \u201cHalo 3\u201d and \u201cThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\u201d",
      "Born in London\u2019s East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton. He married 29-year-old Elizabeth O\u2019Rourke in 2002 at the age of 64 but the couple divorced six years later. Stamp did not have any children.",
      "Stamp retained his looks as the years ticked by, his natural handsomeness hardened by a more grizzled look.",
      "He generally sought to keep his standards high \u2014 to a point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do crappy movies, unless I haven\u2019t got the rent,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d which lost the battle for first place to \u201cWeapons\u201d during its double premiere, maintained its second spot, bringing in $14.5 million domestically. The films' staying power comes during a slower box office weekend, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "Both films prevailed against \u201cNobody 2,\u201d the R-rated action sequel. The Bob Odenkirk-led film earned $9.25 million across 3,260 North American theaters in its debut weekend.",
      "\u201cAugust came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,\u201d Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d and the horror sci-fi \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d that premiered this time last year.",
      "This summer is unlikely to hit the $4 billion benchmark but has provided moviegoers a dynamic and diverse slate of movies, he said.",
      "\"I can\u2019t find a genre that\u2019s not represented or a demographic that wouldn\u2019t be attracted to one of these films out there,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that eclectic mix of films with appeal to every demographic.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d follows the pandemic success of the first in the series, \u201cNobody,\" which was released in 2021. In the sequel, Hutch Mansell, the assassin-turned-nice-guy played by Odenkirk, returns to the big screen, this time taking a much-needed family vacation that goes awry. The calm weekend turns anything but as Mansell uncovers a corrupt town.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distributions at Universal Pictures, said he hopes the movie's reaction scores \u2014 an 89% Audience score and B+ CinemaScore \u2014 point \u201cto a long and successful run at the domestic box office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" took the fourth spot during its fourth weekend in theaters, bringing in $8.8 million domestically. The film stumbled at the box office after its initially strong $118 million debut.",

      "Hernandez Govan, 45, was indicted on first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder charges about a year after Young Dolph was killed. Prosecutors have accused him of organizing the fatal shooting.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Govan is charged with conspiring with Justin Johnson and Cornelius Smith Jr. to kill Young Dolph.",
      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",

      "Margaret Qualley plays a Bakersfield, California, private investigator in Ethan Coen's \u201cHoney Don't.\u201d",
      "The skies are blue, the sun unrelenting and the body count escalating in the Bakersfield, California, of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!,\u201d where Margaret Qualley\u2019s private investigator tries to get a handle on the nefarious goings-on in her city with a small-town feel.",
      "It\u2019s the second film in Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke\u2019s so-called \u201clesbian B-movie trilogy,\u201d and while this shaggy caper might not add up to anything significant \u2014 perhaps part of the \u201cB-movie\u201d point \u2014 it is fun and immensely watchable. That\u2019s thanks in large part to Qualley\u2019s turn as the smoothly confident Honey O\u2019Donahue, kind of a Philip Marlowe, or maybe Veronica Mars, in cherry-red lipstick, high heels and silks (inspired choices for the sweltering setting by costume designer Peggy Schnitzer).",
      "Honey is meant to be strikingly \u201cother\u201d in this very downtrodden Bakersfield of eccentrics, dropouts and lost souls, where missing teeth seem to be more prevalent than pedicures. It\u2019s a carnival of very memorable, very Coen-esque misfits, like a grumpy bartender played by Don Swayze and Charlie Day\u2019s clueless police officer Marty Metakawitch. Marty is not the only man in town who has trouble accepting that Honey will never be interested in him. You could play a drinking game with how many times she has to tell hapless men, \u201cI like girls.\u201d",
      "Not only is queer literacy low in this Bakersfield, but many in town seem to have come under the influence of a church leader played by Chris Evans, the Rev. Drew Devlin, whose high-wattage smile and proclivity for flirting have made him a local celebrity. Evans, who seems to be having fun in a weirder role, plays the Rev. Drew as a charismatic creep, an ego-driven and possibly sex-addicted influencer who is also peddling drugs and arranging hits around town. He too has a boss, or bosses, known only as \u201cthe French,\u201d which is amusingly underexplained. And he\u2019s often completely, or nearly, naked and involved in some cringey, experimental acts with his naive followers.",
      "Not unlike the new \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d this saga begins with a suspicious vehicular death. The deceased was an almost-client of Honey\u2019s, which sets her off poking around and looking for answers. Most of her cases are of the cheating spouse type, and this is just more interesting. Meanwhile, others start dropping dead too. Some of these deaths feel spiritually, comedically similar to the Mark Pellegrino sequence in \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (not the only Lynchian nod). And all signs are pointing back to the church, though Honey gets a bit distracted with a new fling in Aubrey Plaza\u2019s lustful cop MG Falcone and some family drama with her wayward niece Corinne (Talia Ryder).",
      "\u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d might play more like a pilot episode of a television series than a contained film, but it is a step up from Coen and Cooke's previous effort, \u201cDrive Away Dolls,\u201d which felt constructed of comedic parts whose shelf life expired 20 years ago. This script, written by Coen and Cooke, is probably just as vintage, technically speaking, but it feels more timeless. With a stable of memorable side characters, including Josh Pafchek as the reverend's assistant and Jacnier as a skittish new drug dealer named Hector, \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d is gory, unapologetically sexual, quippy and dark. It also clocks in at under 90 minutes \u2014 they knew just when to get out.",

      "In Wagner's home theater in Bayreuth, Germany, a twist has been added to the classic opera \u201cDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.\u201d",
      "BAYREUTH, Germany -- In Wagner's home theater, a twist has been added to the classic opera \u201cDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.\u201d",
      "Instead of Walther joining the guild of master singers and preparing to marry Eva after he wins the song contest, in Bayeuth's new version she grabs the medal out of the young knight's hands, returns it to her father, then leads her future husband offstage for a future forsaking the traditions of their family and city.",
      "\u201cNo thank you. Let's go!\u201d explained soprano Christian Nilsson, who is singing Eva in her role debut. \u201cShe is a strong girl.\u201d",
      "Matthias Davids\u2019 production runs through Aug. 22, emphasizing entertainment with a Hollywood Technicolor look highlighted by an upside-down inflatable cow and a tiny St. Catherine\u2019s Church atop 34 steep steps.",
      "Nilsson's Eva arrives for the Feast of St. John. encased in flowers with additional blossoms in her headdress, carried atop horizontal poles by four men.",
      "\u201cWe were always referring to Eva as the prize cow. We said she is sold like a prize cow,\u201d said Davids, a 63-year-old German director known for his work in theater musicals.",
      "That idea led to the huge heifer, manufactured by a company that makes inflatables and covered with flame retardant coating, according to set designer Andrew Edwards.",
      "Sixtus Beckmesser, the petulant town clerk who loses the song contest to Walther, pulls the plug on the cow, which darkens and sags, during the final oration defending the imperative of German art by the cobbler Hans Sachs.",
      "While Sachs runs to restore the connection \u2014 reinflating the bovine balloon and restoring light \u2014 the young lovers reject him and what he stands for. Townspeople, many wearing conical red caps that give them elf-like looks, shrug their shoulders at the final notes as Sachs and Beckmesser argue upstage.",
      "When \u201cMeistersinger\u201d premiered in 1868, Wagner presented a happy ending in which Walther and Eva joined together and he is admitted to guild. Davids' ending is less jarring than Kasper Holten\u2019s 2017 Covent Garden staging, set in a men's club where Eva is horrified Walther would want to join the misogynistic Meistersingers and runs away in tears.",
      "\u201cI saw some productions and I always found them kind of heavy and meaningful,\u201d Davids said.",

      "He read Wagner's letters about his desire to produce a comedy to earn money and decided to search for lightness and humor while realizing comedy can't constantly sustain over four hours. Details were worked out during rehearsals, with Davids inspired by the chemistry of Nilsson and tenor Michael Spyres, who also was making his debut as Walther.",
      "Nilsson maintains a beatific beam during Walther's prize song.",
      "\u201cI really felt like in this production Eva and Walther truly had a fun connection \u2014 fun, young, loving connection \u2014 and I just leaned into that and listened to Spyres' beautiful tenor,\u201d Nilsson said.",
      "Davids' contrast was sharp from Barrie Kosky's 2017 production, set partly in Wagner's home of Wahnfried and the Nuremberg trials courtroom, with Walther and Sachs portrayed as Wagner of various ages.",
      "This time Georg Zeppenfeld was a grandfatherly Sachs in an argyle button through sweater vest. Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look. Jongmin Park, an imposing Pogner as Eva's father, was attired in a more flowing robe.",
      "Eva wore a traditional dirndl and Walther, an upstart, a punkish T-shirt. Susanne Hubrich costumed various townspeople to resemble German entertainer Thomas Gottschalk, comedian Loriot, fans of the soccer club Kickers Offenbach and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",

      "\u201cJust looking around the audience, there was a lot more smiles on people\u2019s faces at the end than normally you see at the end of Wagner productions,\u201d Nilsson said.",

      "Vibrio vulnificus are becoming an annual threat along the Gulf Coast and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 up the Eastern Seaboard.",
      "People should listen to the warnings, said Bernie Stewart, a 65-year-old retired bounty hunter in Florida who counts himself lucky to have survived an infection.",
      "In August 2019, Stewart's right leg was infected while he was kayak fishing in Pensacola Bay. What at first appeared to be a sun blister led to three months in the hospital, where doctors performed 10 surgeries to remove decaying skin and prevent the bacteria from killing him.",
      "\u201cThis ain't nothing to play with,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "Vibrio bacteria thrive in seawater and in the mix of fresh and saltwater found in estuaries and lagoons. Most infections are reported from May to October, and most happen in states along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Gulf\u2019s water is \"the perfect convergence of the right amount of salt and the right amount of heat to let this organism proliferate,\u201d said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious diseases specialist at the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.",
      "The nastiest type is Vibrio vulnificus. It accounts for around 200 of the more than 1,000 Vibrio illnesses each year, according to CDC data.",
      "As many as 1 in 5 of those infections are fatal \u2014 a much higher rate than other types of Vibrio bacteria.",
      "Some people become infected by eating eat raw or undercooked shellfish \u2014 particularly oysters. But a large percentage fall ill when the person is in ocean or brackish water and the bacteria enter the body through small breaks in the skin.",
      "The antibiotics used to treat food poisoning cases don't work as well when the germ enters through breaks in the skin, Lopez said.",
      "\u201cThey may require multiple surgeries to remove dead or infected tissue, and sometimes require amputation,\u201d he said.",

      "Vibrio vulnificus can enter the body through unhealed cuts and scrapes, recent piercings and tattoos, and recent surgical incisions. If you have such a wound, try to stay out of saltwater or brackish water, and cover it with a waterproof bandage if there\u2019s a chance of exposure.",

The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",

      "In their letter to the head of DEA, the attorneys general said bromazolam is being sold illicitly on the streets and online. It is highly potent and unpredictable, they said, especially when combined with opioids or other central nervous system depressants. Unlike regulated medications, illicitly manufactured bromazolam lacks quality controls, making it particularly lethal for unsuspecting users, they said.",
      "\u201cDespite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWithout scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.\u201d",
      "Emergency action by the DEA would help law enforcement remove the drug from circulation, give prosecutors the ability to hold traffickers accountable and would \u201csend a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Besides Coleman, the request to the DEA included attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia, Coleman's office said.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

      "McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn\u2019t as simple as many seem to believe.",
      "The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 course of action if there are no residents or structures is to let them burn or \u201cit is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\u201d McMullen said.",
      "Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren\u2019t practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.",
      "McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire coordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.",
      "But as for stopping worsening fires, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much they can do,\u201d said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.",

      "Other viruses circulating this time of year include the one that causes \u201chand, foot and mouth\u201d disease \u2014 which has symptoms similar to a cold, plus sores and rashes \u2014 and norovirus, sometimes called the stomach flu.",
      "Many viruses circulate seasonally, picking up as the weather cools in the fall and winter. So it's true that fewer people get stuffy noses and coughs in the summer \u2014 but cold weather itself does not cause colds.",
      "It's not just about seasonality. The other factor is our behavior, experts say. Nice weather means people are opening windows and gathering outside where it's harder for germs to spread.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

The \u201cmansions\u201d represent small groups of Rastafarians who meet to worship together.

      "SANTA ROSA, Peru -- A remote island on the Amazon river \u2014 now the subject of a territorial dispute between Peru and Colombia \u2014 has a single paved road for a main street, which is home to more nightclubs and evangelical churches than any other businesses.",
      "Named after a 16th-century saint, Santa Rosa has no running water or sewage system for its 3,000 residents, who build their one-story homes on stilts to prevent them from flooding every year. People are Peruvian, but they cross the river to neighboring cities in Colombia or Brazil to see a doctor for routine care or an emergency that the rusting local health center cannot handle.",
      "\u201cOur island suffers from many needs,\u201d said Marcos Mera, the owner of a restaurant and dance hall in Santa Rosa, as he wiped sweat from his forehead and set up tables.",
      "While the struggles of Mera and his neighbors are not new, their hometown has suddenly become the center of attention for the Peruvian government. The surge in interest even garnered a presidential visit after Colombian President Gustavo Petro disavowed Peruvian jurisdiction over Santa Rosa earlier this month.",
      "Peru maintains it owns Santa Rosa Island based on treaties about a century old, but Colombia disputes that ownership because the island had not yet emerged from the Amazon river at the time.",
      "Residents see themselves as proud Peruvians even though they rely on other countries for basic needs. Now, they hope their government will not forget them again, a sentiment that President Dina Boluarte acknowledged during a recent visit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that, for too long, our border populations have not received the attention they deserve,\u201d Boluarte said Friday during her first-ever visit to the island.",
      "Recent tensions between Peru and Colombia have escalated into a series of incidents, including the arrest of three Colombian men who were on the island doing land surveying work. The arrests, described by Petro as \u201ckidnapping,\u201d prompted a dispute over the workers' rights to be in Santa Rosa. They marked the third binational incident in the area since Petro denied Peru\u2019s jurisdiction over Santa Rosa Island in early August.",
      "\u201cWe are Peruvians, and if necessary, we will defend our island with pride,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Morales outside his currency-exchange house where he trades Peruvian soles, Colombian pesos and U.S. dollars. Residents often carry all three currencies, plus Brazilian reals, at once.",

In contrast, the trip from Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, involves a two-hour flight followed by a 15-hour boat journey.",
      "The parents, children and grandchildren of many Santa Rosa residents live in Leticia, Colombia, or Tabatinga, Brazil. Some have also buried their loved ones in those cities, too, as Santa Rosa does not have a cemetery. Several residents said they have a cordial relationship with people in Colombia and Brazil.",

Built on a hill so worshippers could overlook the rest of Kiruna, the Swedish Lutheran church was designed to emulate the Sami style as a gift from LKAB, the state-owned mining company.",
      "The Kiruna mine itself dates back to 1910 and the church was completed in 1912. Its neo-Gothic exterior is considered the town's most distinctive building and tourists regularly traveled there before it was closed a year ago to prepare for the relocation. It's set to reopen in the new location at the end of 2026.",

      "The move of Kiruna's town center, including the church, has been in the works since 2004. As the mine expanded deeper underground, residents began seeing cracks in buildings and roads. In order to reach a new depth of 1,365 meters (4,478 feet) \u2014 and to prevent Kiruna from being swallowed up \u2014 officials began moving buildings to a new downtown at a safe distance from the mine.",

      "At approximately 40 meters (131 feet) wide with a weight of 672 metric tons (741 tons), the church required extra effort. Engineers widened a major road from 9 meters to 24 meters (30 to 79 feet) and dismantled a viaduct to make way for a new intersection.",

      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",

      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, there were 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths in 2023. Many were children younger than 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",
      "The development of Coartem Baby has given hope to many, with local health workers and others saying the medicine will save the lives of many infants.",
      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

He told U.S. authorities that he was wired about $2 million to do so, according to the complaint.",
      "Authorities did not specify in the complaint the types of weapons that were exported.",
      "To carry out his operation, Wen purchased a business in 2023 called Super Armory, a federal firearms licensee, for $150,000, and registered it under his business partner's name in Texas. He had other people purchase the firearms and then drove them to California, misrepresenting the shipments as a refrigerator and camera parts. Investigators did not say whether Wen had organized any shipments during his first 10 years in the U.S.",
      "The FBI in September seized 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's home in the LA suburb of Ontario that had been stored in a van parked in the driveway, the complaint says. They also seized a chemical threat identification device and a transmission detective device that Wen said he planned to send to the North Korean government for military use, the complaint says.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated that it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

She served as Missouri's first and only woman House speaker before losing a bid for secretary of state in 2004. She was appointed the next year by President George W.

      "She lost a Republican primary for governor in 2016.",

      "Husch Blackwell also represents Invenergy, which is attempting to use eminent domain to acquire land for a high-voltage transmission line to carry wind-generated power from Kansas across Missouri and Illinois to an electric grid in Indiana. Bailey has opposed the project, and Hanaway said she will recuse herself as the attorney general's office continues a civil investigation into it.",
      "Bailey, a staunch Trump supporter, has served as attorney general since January 2023 and won election last November to a full four-year term. Hanaway said she intends to serve the remainder of Bailey's term and seek election herself in 2028.",

      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer price inflation was 3.8% in the year to July, up from 3.6% in June. One of the contributors was airfares soaring by 30.2% between June and July, the biggest jump since the collection of monthly data began in 2001.",
      "Most economists had anticipated a more modest rise in inflation to 3.7%.",
      "With inflation now at its highest rate since January 2024 and nearly double the Bank of England's target of 2%, the prospects of another rate cut in 2025 are diminishing.",

      "The swift rescues stand out in an industry where roughly two and a half newspapers disappear each week, according to a 2024 report from the Medill School of Journalism. The editor at one revived paper said his new owner saw ongoing profitability, while other outlets will be grabbed by publishers motivated by a sense of civic duty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming, to be honest,\u201d said Kayla Jessen, general manager of the Redfield Press, one of the rescued papers in South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019re all excited that we can bring news back to the community again.\u201d",
      "The turnarounds happened quickly. Illinois-based News Media Corporation announced on Aug. 6 it was immediately closing 31 outlets in five states because of financial problems. In less than two weeks, a publishing group in Wyoming said it would buy eight papers in the state, while a company in North Carolina said it would purchase four newspapers in South Dakota. Both buyers say all staff will be offered a chance to return.",
      "The fate of other papers in Arizona, Illinois and Nebraska remains unclear.",
      "After the closures, journalists and their communities scrambled for options to save the publications. In addition to regional news, many of the papers serve as their towns' official outlet for legal notices.",
      "Rural areas often don't have local radio or TV stations, said Benjy Hamm, director at the University of Kentucky\u2019s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues. That can leave a lone newspaper as the only media outlet in the area.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target CEO Brian Cornell, who helped reenergize the company but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the COVID pandemic, plans to step down Feb. 1.",
      "Minneapolis-based Target Corp. said Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran, will succeed Cornell. Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board.",
      "Cornell, 66, took the helm at Target in August 2014. In September 2022, the board extended his contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65.",
      "Cornell said the appointment followed several years of board vetting of both internal and external candidates. Fiddelke has overhauled Target\u2019s supply network and expanded the company\u2019s stores and digital services while cutting costs.",
      "\u201cMike was the right candidate to lead our business back to growth,\u201d Cornell told reporters. \u201cAs I arrived at Target, I consistently relied on Michael\u2019s strategic insights and sound judgment when making decisions. Michael has developed a deeper knowledge of our business than anyone I know.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke told reporters he\u2019s stepping into the role with \u201curgency\u201d to reclaim the company\u2019s merchandising authority.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re leading with swagger in our merchandising authority, when we have swagger in our marketing, and we\u2019re setting the trend for retail, those are some of the moments I think that Target has been at its highest in my 20 years,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, Target announced that Fiddelke would lead a new office focused on faster decision-making to help accelerate sales growth.",
      "The change in leadership was announced Wednesday at the same time that Target reported another quarter of sluggish results. The company\u2019s stock was down more than 8% in pre-market trading.",
      "Target reported a 21% drop in net income in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9% dip in comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels. Target has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, has been the focus of consumer boycotts since late January, when it joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target\u2019s sales also have languished as customers defect to Walmart and off-price department store chains like TJ Maxx in search of lower prices. But many analysts think Target is stumbling because consumers no longer consider it the place to go for affordable but stylish products, a niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "In fact, out of 35 merchandise categories that Target tracks, it gained or maintaining market share in only 14 during the latest quarter, Fiddelke told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart gained market share among households with incomes over $100,000 as U.S. inflation caused consumer prices to rise rapidly. Lower-income shoppers have driven customer growth at Target, suggesting it may have lost appeal with wealthier customers, according to market research firm Consumer Edge.",

      "In March, members of Target\u2019s executive team told investors they planned to regain the chain\u2019s reputation for selling stylish goods at budget prices by expanding Target\u2019s lineup of store label brands and shortening the time it took to get new items from the idea stage to store shelves. The moves would help the company stay close to trends, executives said.",
      "\u201cIn a world where we operate today, our guests are looking for Tarzhay,\u201d Cornell told investors. \u201cConsumers coined that term decades ago to define how we elevate the everything everyday to something special, how we had unexpected fun in the shopping that would be otherwise routine.\u201d",
      "Before joining Target, Cornell spent more than 30 years in leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies, including as chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. and CEO at Michaels, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club and PepsiCo America Foods. He came to Target when the company was facing a different set of challenges.",
      "Cornell replaced former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down nearly five months after Target disclosed a huge data breach in which hackers stole millions of customers\u2019 credit- and debit-card records. The theft badly damaged the chain\u2019s reputation and profits.",
      "Cornell reenergized sales by having his team rev up Target\u2019s store brands. It now has 40 private label brands in its portfolio. And even before the pandemic, Cornell spearheaded the company\u2019s mission to transform its stores into delivery hubs to cut down on costs and speed up deliveries.",
      "Target\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Shipt helped bolster the discounter\u2019s same-day, store-based fulfillment services. Cornell also focused on making its stores better tailored to the local community",
      "The coronavirus pandemic delivered outsized sales for Target as well as its peers as people stayed home and bought pajamas, furnishings and kitchen items. And it continued to see a surge in sales as shoppers emerged from their homes and went to stores. But the spending sprees eventually subsided.",
      "As inflation started to spike, Target reported a 52% drop in profits during its 2022 first quarter compared with a year earlier. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic faded, leaving the retailer with excess inventory that had to be sold off.",
      "In July 2023, as shoppers feeling pinched by inflation curtailed their spending, Target said its comparable sales declined for the first time in six years.",
      "Moreover, Target started losing its edge as an authority on style by focusing too much on home furnishings basics, and not enough trendy items, Fiddelke said.",
      "A customer backlash over the annual line of LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise Target stores carried that year further cut into sales.",
      "Although Walmart retreated from its diversity initiatives first, Target has been the focus of more concerted consumer boycotts. Organizers have said they viewed Target\u2019s action as a greater betrayal because the company previously had held itself out as a champion of inclusion.",

      "A train derails and spills at least 1,000 gallons of hazardous materials in the U.S. about once every two months. Nearly half of those derailments resulted in evacuations; more than a quarter resulted in a fire or explosion since 2015, an analysis of federal derailment data showed.",
      "And many communities along the rail lines aren\u2019t prepared to keep people safe when it happens.",
      "That\u2019s the finding of an investigation by the University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism that reviewed hundreds of rail safety documents and reports and interviewed dozens of industry professionals and first responders.",
      "The Howard Center also obtained unprecedented access to rail data collected by a network of AI-enhanced camera sensors, which allowed reporters to track shipments of hazardous materials along 2,200 miles of rail lines between the U.S.-Canadian border and West Texas.",
      "That data, provided by a private company called RailState LLC, showed that over the last six months at least 130,000 rail cars displaying placards for hazardous materials moved along sections of rail lines stretching from Blaine, Washington, to Amarillo, Texas. Those cars passed the homes of at least 2.5 million people living within a mile of the tracks, along with more than 1,000 schools and 80 hospitals, the analysis found.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that most communities are probably not aware of what chemicals are going up and down the railroads in their backyard, day in and day out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Burgess, a hazmat training director at the International Association of Firefighters.",
      "First responders often lack the information, training, equipment and detailed planning needed to safely respond in the immediate aftermath of a hazmat derailment.",
      "Fewer than one in five fire departments nationwide have their own team of hazmat specialists, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.",
      "Confronted with a catastrophic hazmat derailment, local firefighters rely on a web of mutual support \u2014 from nearby departments, regional hazmat teams, state and federal officials, and railroad contractors \u2014 for the expertise and equipment they may lack. Yet those teams might be hours away, leaving firefighters to handle the unfolding crisis on their own.",
      "After a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023, it took more than an hour for firefighters with specialized hazmat training to arrive at the scene.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually the first time that they\u2019ve ever dealt with something like this, and they\u2019re overwhelmed in the beginning,\u201d said Paul Stancil, who recently left his job as a senior hazardous materials accident investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThat was a problem in East Palestine. It\u2019s a problem in almost every site.\u201d",
      "In 2024, railroad industry-funded hazmat training initiatives reached at least 80,000 first responders, according to industry estimates. But this represents just a fraction of the estimated 1 million career and volunteer firefighters in the U.S, according to U.S. Fire Administration numbers.",
      "Jessica Kahanek, a spokesperson for the Association of American Railroads, said rail is the safest way to transport hazardous materials over land, adding that U.S. railroads safely carried more than 2 million hazardous material shipments in 2024.",
      "The Howard Center analysis of federal data found 57 derailments in the last decade that resulted in the release of at least 1,000 gallons (3,800 liters) of hazardous material. Twenty-six of those derailments resulted in evacuations; 16 caused fires or an explosion.",
      "When such derailments occur, firefighters called to the scene often face a critical problem: Many don\u2019t know what chemicals are on board the train and what the exposure risks might be. And federal regulators have delayed the requirement to immediately supply that information.",
      "In a letter to federal regulators this month, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick criticized the delay and urged regulators to enforce a stricter timeline on railroads.",
      "\u201cThe 2023 East Palestine derailment in my village highlighted a critical lack of timely communication with public safety about hazardous materials information involved in rail emergencies,\u201d Drabick wrote. Without strict enforcement by regulators, he added, \u201cI am concerned that the derailment in my community could be repeated.\u201d",
      "When communities are unprepared for a hazmat spill, the consequences can be dire.",
      "In 2012, a derailment in Paulsboro, New Jersey, sent several tank cars carrying vinyl chloride \u2014 a highly toxic and flammable chemical \u2014 plunging into a creek. One of the tank cars broke open, spewing a cloud of toxic gas that engulfed the surrounding area.",
      "Local police and volunteer firefighters, initially confused about the chemical released, approached the wreck without breathing protection \u2014 even standing in the cloud. The initial evacuation area was too small, investigators later found, and many nearby residents spent hours in the exposure zone.",

A placard indicates the car is loaded with hazardous material or contains hazmat residue.",
      "In 2019, a Canadian National train derailed inside that tunnel, spilling over 12,000 gallons (45,400 liters) of sulfuric acid. The response counted on a web of support from local and state agencies, railroad hazmat specialists and Canadian authorities, all under the direction of the Environmental Protection Agency.",

Running back Chase Brown\u2019s 1-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal capped a 58-yard drive on the opening possession at Northwest Stadium.",
      "The Bengals (1-1) planned on using their starters longer in preseason games to hopefully avoid a string of poor regular-season starts. Over two games with Burrow at quarterback, Cincinnati scored touchdowns on four of five possessions.",
      "\u201cThose are just incredibly valuable reps that usually you work out those kinks in the first couple of weeks in the regular season, and we\u2019ve worked them out the last two weeks,\u201d Burrow said.",

Following runs of 19 and 40 yards by Deebo Samuel and Chris Rodriguez, respectively, Daniels evaded pass rushers and suspect tackling for a 14-yard dash up the middle. The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year and 2023 Heisman recipient did not attempt a pass, nor a slide on the touchdown despite running into traffic.",
      "\u201cI'm playing football. I know everybody puts an emphasis on the preseason, but it's a game to me,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Washington head coach Dan Quinn would prefer his star quarterback to choose caution at times in those spots, \u201cbut it is part of his game. It's what makes him a special player. \u201d",
      "Considering the Commanders played without three offensive line starters, two starting receivers, and tight end Zach Ertz, limiting Daniels\u2019 exposure to hits and a slick field courtesy of pre-game rain was probably the proper call. Terry McLaurin, a 2024 second-team All-Pro wide receiver, remains a non-participant amid a contract dispute.",
      "Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt raced for a 27-yard touchdown on Washington\u2019s second possession and finished with 46 yards on 11 carries. The seventh-round pick became a training camp sensation for the Commanders, and his scoring scamper won\u2019t dampen any enthusiasm. Rodriguez increased his chances for a rotation spot by rushing for a team-high 62 yards on six carries.",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "TikTok disputed Minnesota's allegations.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "The AI expansion on the four Pixel 10 models amplifies Google's efforts to broaden the use of a technology that is already starting to reshape society. At the same time, Google is taking a swipe at Apple's Achilles' heel on the iPhone.",
      "Apple so far has only been able to introduce a few basic AI features on the iPhone while failing to deliver on last year\u2019s promise to deliver a more conversational and versatile version of its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri.",
      "Without mentioning the iPhone by name, Google has already been mocking Apple\u2019s missteps in online ads promoting the four new Pixel models as smartphones loaded with AI technology that consumers won\u2019t have to wait for more than a year to arrive.",
      "Google, in contrast, has been steadily increasing the amount of AI that it began to implant on its Pixels since 2023, with this year\u2019s models taking it to another level.",
      "Taking advantage of a more advanced processor, Google is introducing a new AI feature on the Pixel 10 phones called \u201cMagic Cue\u201d that\u2019s designed to serve as a digital mind reader that automatically fetches information stored on the devices and displays the data at the time it\u2019s needed. For instance, if a Pixel 10 user is calling up an airline, Magic Cue is supposed to instantaneously recognize the phone number and display the flight information if it\u2019s in Gmail or a Google Calendar.",

Camera Coach will also recommend the best lens mode to use for an optimal picture.",
      "The premium models \u2014 Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 will also include a \u201cSuper Res\u201d option that deploys a grab bag of software and AI tricks to zoom up to 100 times the resolution to capture the details of objects located miles away from the camera. The AI wizardry could happen without users even realizing it\u2019s happening, making it even more difficult to know whether an image captured in a photo reflects how things really looked at the time a picture was taken or was modified by technology.",
      "Google is also offering a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan to anyone who buys the more expensive Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL models in hopes of hooking more people on the Gemini toolkit it has assembled to compete against OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",

Although the company has already said the smarter Siri won't be ready until next year at the earliest, Apple will still be expected to show some progress in AI to demonstrate the iPhone is adapting to technology's AI evolution rather than tilting toward gradual obsolescence.

      "Lawyers for the media giant Meta says a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, should be thrown out",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed by families of the Uvalde school shooting victims alleging Instagram allowed gun manufacturers to promote firearms to minors should be thrown out, lawyers for Meta, Instagram's parent company, argued Tuesday.",
      "Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "The families sued Meta in Los Angeles in May 2024, saying the social media platform failed to enforce its own rules forbidding firearms advertisements aimed at minors. The families, who were present at last month's hearing, did not appear in court, with a lawyer citing the back-to-school season. Many plaintiffs attended the hearing virtually, he said.",
      "In one ad posted on Instagram, the Georgia-based gunmaker Daniel Defense shows Santa Claus holding an assault rifle. In another post by the same company, a rifle leans against a refrigerator, with the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s normalize kitchen Daniels. What Daniels do you use to protect your kitchen and home?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges those posts are marketed toward minors. The Uvalde gunman opened an online account with Daniel Defense before his 18th birthday and purchased the rifle as soon as he could, according to the lawsuit. He also owned various Instagram accounts and had an \u201cobsessive relationship\u201d with the platform, at times opening the app more than 100 times a day, plaintiffs' lawyers found in an analysis of the shooter's phone.",
      "Meta attorney Kristin Linsley argued that the families provided no proof that minors, including the Uvalde gunman, even read the Daniel Defense posts on Instagram. She also said the posts didn't violate Meta\u2019s policies because they weren\u2019t direct advertisements and did not include links to purchase any products.",
      "Katie Mesner-Hage, representing the victims' families, said the defense\u2019s claim is \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d as the plaintiffs don\u2019t have access to Meta data that would indicate whether the shooter encountered those posts. She added that if the content had landed on the shooter\u2019s feed, as the plaintiffs allege, then Meta \u201cnot only knew about it, they designed the system so it would be delivered to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey knew more about him than anyone else on the planet,\u201d she said.",
      "Linsley said content advertising firearms for sale on Instagram is allowed if posted by \u201cbrick-and-motor and online retailers,\u201d but visibility of those posts was restricted for minors under Meta\u2019s advertising policies from the end of 2021 to October 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is not a playbook for how to violate the rules. This is actually what the rules are,\u201d Linsley said.",
      "The plaintiff\u2019s team, however, showed a fake profile they created for a 17-year-old boy earlier this month, through which they were able to search Daniel Defense\u2019s Instagram account and see a post that included a picture of a gun, as well as a link to the gun manufacturer\u2019s website.",
      "When the link was clicked, the gun-maker\u2019s website opened, and the team was able to select a firearm and add it to their cart, all within Instagram\u2019s app \u2014 an experiment that refutes Meta\u2019s assertion that posts relating to firearms aren\u2019t visible to users under 21, Mesner-Hage said.",

      "\"The only response a company can have is to not have these kinds of rules at all,\" Linsley said. \u201cIt just gets you down a rabbit hole very quickly.\u201d",
      "Mesner-Hage argued Meta is not protected by the act because social media platforms don\u2019t just host speech, but help curate it through its algorithms. Daniel Defense, she said, didn't have to pay for ads to get free access to Meta's analytical data through its business account on Instagram. That data shows the company which age bracket and gender engaged most with a specific post.",
      "\u201cDaniel Defense is not on Instagram to make friends. ... They\u2019re on there to promote their product,\u201d Mesner-Hage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paid advertisement, but I would struggle to describe this as anything other than an advertisement.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that firearm companies tweaked their online marketing to comply with Meta's policies, including by avoiding the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d and not providing links to purchase, and that the social media company did not protect users against such strategies.",
      "Last month, lawyers for Activision also argued that legal proceedings against them should be thrown out, saying the families allegations are barred by the First Amendment. The families alleged that the war-themed video game Call of Duty trained and conditioned the Uvalde gunman to orchestrate his attack.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs asked the judge to allow them to amend their lawsuit with the new information they presented Tuesday before ruling on the defense\u2019s motion. The defense claimed that was unnecessary, as the case would not have merit even with the amendments.",

      "\u201cWe had this vision five years ago for a seaglider \u2014 something that is as fast as an aircraft and as easy to drive as a boat,\u201d said CEO Billy Thalheimer, jubilant after an hours-long test run of the new vessel.",
      "On a cloudy August morning, Thalheimer sat in the Paladin's cockpit and, for the first time, took control of his company's prototype craft to test its hydrofoils. The electric-powered watercraft has three modes \u2014 float, foil and fly.",
      "From the dock, it sets off like any motorized boat. Farther away from land, it rises up on hydrofoils \u2014 the same kind used by sailing ships that compete in America\u2019s Cup. The foils enable it to travel more than 50 miles per hour \u2014 and about a person's height \u2014 above the bay.",
      "What makes this vessel so unusual is that it's designed to soar about 30 feet (10 meters) above the water at up to 180 miles per hour \u2014 a feat that hasn't quite happened yet, with the first trial flights off Rhode Island's seacoast planned for the end of summer or early fall.",
      "If successful, the Paladin will coast on a cushion of air over Rhode Island Sound, lifting with the same \u201cground effect\u201d that pelicans, cormorants and other birds use to conserve energy as they swiftly glide over the sea. It could zoom to New York City \u2014 which takes at least three hours by train and longer on traffic-clogged freeways \u2014 in just an hour.",
      "As it works to prove its seaworthiness to the U.S. Coast Guard and other regulators around the world, Regent is already lining up future customers for commercial ferry routes around Florida, Hawaii, Japan and the Persian Gulf.",
      "Regent is also working with the U.S. Marines to repurpose the same vessels for island-hopping troops in the Pacific. Those vessels would likely trade electric battery power for jet fuel to cover longer journeys.",
      "With backing from influential investors including Peter Thiel and Mark Cuban, Thalheimer says he\u2019s trying to use new technology to revive the \u201ccomfort and refined nature\u201d of 1930s-era flying boats that were popular in aviation\u2019s golden age before they were eclipsed by commercial airlines.",
      "This time, Thalheimer added, they're safer, quieter and emission-free.",
      "\u201cI thought they made travel easier in a way that made total sense to me,\u201d Cuban said by email this week. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to travel around water for short distances. It\u2019s expensive and a hassle. Regent can solve this problem and make that travel fun, easy and efficient.\u201d",
      "Co-founders and friends Thalheimer, a skilled sailor, and chief technology officer Mike Klinker, who grew up lobster fishing, met while both were freshmen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later worked together at Boeing. They started Regent in 2020.",
      "They've already tested and flown a smaller model. But the much bigger, 12-passenger Paladin \u2014 prototype of a product line called Viceroy \u2014 began foil testing this summer after years of engineering research and development. A manufacturing facility is under construction nearby, with the vessels set to carry passengers by 2027.",
      "The International Maritime Organization classifies \u201cwing-in-ground-effect\u201d vehicles such as Regent's as ships, not aircraft. But a database of civilian ships kept by the London-based organization lists only six around the world, all of them built before it issued new safety guidance on such craft in 2018 following revisions sought by China, France and Russia.",

      "One of the biggest technical challenges in Regent's design is the shift from foiling to flying. Hydrofoils are fast for a seafaring vessel, but far slower than the speeds needed to lift a conventional airplane from a runway.",
      "That's where air blown by the 12 propellers comes in, effectively tricking the wing into generating high lift at low speeds.",
      "All of this has worked perfectly on the computer simulations at Regent's headquarters in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The next step is testing it over the water.",
      "For decades, the only warship known to mimic such a ground-effect design was the Soviet Union's hulking ekranoplan, which was built to fly under radar detection but never widely used. Recently, however, social media images of an apparent Chinese military ekranoplan have caught the attention of naval experts amid increasingly tense international disputes in the South China Sea.",
      "Regent has capitalized on those concerns, pitching its gliders to the U.S. government as a new method for carrying troops and cargo across island chains in the Indo-Pacific region. It could also do clandestine intelligence collection, anti-submarine warfare and be a \u201cmothership\u201d for small drones, autonomous watercraft or medical evacuations, said Tom Huntley, head of Regent's government relations and defense division.",
      "They fly below radar and above sonar, which makes them \u201creally hard to see,\u201d Huntley said.",
      "While the U.S. military has shown increasing interest, questions remain about their detectability, as well as their stability in various sea states and wind conditions, and their \"cost at scale beyond a few prototypes and maintainability,\u201d said retired U.S. Navy Capt. Paul S. Schmitt, an associate research professor at the Naval War College, across the bay in Newport, Rhode Island.",
      "Schmitt, who has seen Paladin from afar while sailing, said he also has questions about what kind of military mission would fit Regent's \u201crelatively short range and small transport capacity.\"",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",
      "Valuable minerals and other materials found on the moon and in asteroids could lead to future conflicts as nations look to exploit new technologies and energy sources.",

However it could get stronger again on Thursday before finally weakening by Friday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) as of Wednesday morning.",

      "In San Francisco Bay, salt ponds created more than a century ago are reverting to marshland. Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,\u201d said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",
      "The same is happening in other states.",
      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",
      "The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.",

      "On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time.",

      "Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.",
      "But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, \u201cwe're realizing that ... marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,\u201d said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",

      "The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don\u2019t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating.

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Texas' Republican-led legislature is expected to approve new congressional maps that add five new House seats that the GOP could win",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The first domino in a growing national redistricting battle is likely to fall Wednesday as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature is expected to pass a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP.",
      "The vote follows prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives, and weeks of delays after dozens of Texas Democratic state lawmakers fled the state in protest. Some Democrats returned Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday's session. Those who refused to be monitored were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night.",
      "Furious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California's legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state's voters in November.",
      "Normally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.",
      "In Texas, Democrats spent the day before the vote continuing to draw attention to the extraordinary lengths the Republicans who run the legislature were going to ensure it takes place. Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the \u201cpermission slip\u201d needed to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. She spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.",
      "Dallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to explain the entire process is: It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a movie.\u201d",
      "The trooper assignments, ordered by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows, was another escalation of a redistricting battle that has widened across the country. Trump is pushing GOP state officials to tilt the map for the 2026 midterms more in his favor to preserve the GOP\u2019s slim House majority, and Democrats nationally have rallied around efforts to retaliate.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole starting Thursday, marking the closest they've been to winning freedom from prison since their convictions almost 30 years ago for murdering their parents.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "The brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under California law because they were under the ages of 26 when they committed their crimes.",
      "A panel or two or three parole hearing officers from a board of commissioners appointed by the governor will evaluate the brothers individually. Erik Menendez will have his hearing Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday, over videoconference from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",
      "The board will assess whether the brothers pose an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society\u201d if released, considering factors like criminal history, motivation for the crime and signs of remorse, behavior while in prison and plans for the future, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother's parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole. Only then, if Newsom affirms the parole, would the Menendez brothers be able to leave prison.",
      "Newsom had previously ordered the state parole board to conduct a risk assessment of the brothers in response to a clemency request. At the time, he emphasized that the key question was whether the brothers posed an \u201cunreasonable risk to public safety.\u201d",
      "He noted at a May news conference that he has both approved and rejected decisions by the parole board before and that he was the \u201cultimate arbiter.\u201d",
      "The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought release last month for Erik Menendez after he was hospitalized for a \u201cserious medical condition.\u201d He has since returned to prison.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",

      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated that it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",

      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "An attorney who helped design the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have undermined the fairness of a settlement program for abuse victims at the state\u2019s youth detention center",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- An attorney who helped design and implement the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have eroded the fairness of a settlement program for those who were abused at the state\u2019s youth detention center.",
      "Deborah Greenspan, who served as deputy special master of the fund created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, recently submitted an affidavit in a class-action lawsuit seeking to block changes to New Hampshire\u2019s out-of-court settlement fund for abuse victims. She's among those expected to testify Wednesday at a hearing on the state's request to dismiss the case and other matters.",
      "More than 1,300 people have sued the state since 2020 alleging that they were physically or sexually abused as children while in state custody, mostly at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. Most of them put their lawsuits on hold after lawmakers created a settlement fund in 2022 that was pitched as a \u201cvictim-centered\u201d and \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d alternative to litigation run by a neutral administrator appointed by the state Supreme Court. But the Republican-led Legislature changed that process through last-minute additions to the state budget Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed in June.",
      "The amended law gives the governor authority to hire and fire the fund's administrator and gives the attorney general \u2014 also a political appointee \u2014 veto power over settlement awards. That stands in stark contrast to other victim compensation funds, said Greenspan, who currently serves as a court-appointed special master for lawsuits related to lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan.",
      "She said it \u201cstrains credulity\u201d to believe that anyone would file a claim knowing that \u201cthe persons ultimately deciding the claim were those responsible for the claimant\u2019s injuries.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch a construct would go beyond the appearance of impropriety and create a clear conflict of interest, undermining the fairness and legitimacy of the settlement process,\" she wrote.",
      "Ayotte and Attorney General John Formella responded by asking a judge to bar Greenspan's testimony, saying she offered \u201cpolicy preferences masquerading as expert opinions\u201d without explaining the principles beyond her conclusions.",
      "\u201cHer affidavit is instead a series of non sequiturs that move from her experience to her conclusions without any of the necessary connective tissue,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The defendants argue that the law still requires the administrator to be \u201can independent, neutral attorney\u201d and point out that the same appointment process is used for the state's judges. They said giving the attorney general the authority to accept or reject settlements is necessary to give the public a voice and ensure that the responsibility for spending millions of dollars in public funds rests with the executive branch.",
      "As of June 30, nearly 2,000 people had filed claims with the settlement fund, which caps payouts at $2.5 million. A total of 386 had been settled, with an average award of $545,000.",
      "One of the claimants says he was awarded $1.5 million award in late July, but the state hasn't finalized it yet, leaving him worried that Formella will veto it.",

      "The Oregon city at the heart of a major U.S. Supreme Court homelessness ruling has agreed to ensure camping spaces for at least 150 people as part of a settlement with an advocacy group",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The Oregon city at the heart of a major U.S. Supreme Court homelessness ruling has agreed to ensure camping spaces for at least 150 people as part of a settlement reached with a disability rights group that sued the city over its camping rules.",
      "Disability Rights Oregon, which sued Grants Pass in January, said Friday that it had reached a settlement agreement. The advocacy group accused the city of discriminating against people with disabilities and violating a state law requiring cities\u2019 camping regulations to be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis settlement represents a significant step forward in ensuring people with disabilities experiencing homelessness have places to rest, basic necessities like drinking water, and real opportunity to stabilize their lives,\u201d Jake Cornett, executive director and CEO of Disability Rights Oregon, said in a statement.",
      "Grants Pass Mayor Clint Scherf said in an email Tuesday that the city appreciates having reached an agreement and will \"continue to work toward effective measures to benefit all members of our community.\u201d",
      "A copy of the settlement agreement showed the city signed off on it earlier this month.",
      "Josephine County Circuit Court Judge Sarah McGlaughlin issued a preliminary injunction in March blocking the city from enforcing its camping rules unless it increased capacity at city-approved sites for camping and ensured they are physically accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "City ordinances prohibit sleeping or leaving personal property in a park overnight in most cases. Those found in violation can be fined up to $50.",
      "The city said Friday on Facebook that law enforcement \u201cwill begin noticing the parks, and occupants will have 72 hours to remove their belongings.\u201d",

Its parks in particular became a flashpoint, with many of them becoming the site of encampments blighted by drug use and litter.",
      "Last June, in a case brought by the city, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that communities can ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there are not enough shelter beds.",
      "After the high court ruling, Grants Pass banned camping on all city property except locations designated by the City Council, which established sites for the town\u2019s hundreds of homeless people in a bid to move them from the parks.",

      "They are the hurricanes of legend, the bowling balls that cross the entire Atlantic Ocean, menaced ships of yore and make the long, curved lines on the hurricane charts.",
      "Cape Verde storms, named for the group of islands about 450 miles (725 kilometers) off the west coast of Africa, typically form from clusters of thunderstorms that move off the continent and into the Atlantic.",
      "With thousands of miles of ocean water above the 80-degree Fahrenheit (27-degree Celsius) temperature needed to fuel hurricanes, Cape Verde storms are some of the most dangerous that threaten North America. About 85% of all major hurricanes \u2014 Category 3 and higher \u2014 start out there, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "\u201cThey are the media stars and certainly get a lot of attention because you can track them for a long time,\" said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections.",
      "But they also are a rare threat. Less than one out of every 10 of the storms crash into the U.S. The rest either fall apart or are curved out to sea by the north and east steering winds that normally prevail over the Atlantic.",
      "Conditions need to be just right for Cape Verde storms to form and grow, keeping them mostly confined to August and September.",
      "Hurricane Erin is a Cape Verde storm. The National Hurricane Center is watching two more clusters of storms to the east of Erin that could develop into tropical storms.",
      "But the atmosphere is too complex to know how strong those storms can be if they develop or whether any of them will threaten the U.S. Forecasters begin to lose confidence in their ability to predict the future of any specific storms more than a week out. It takes at least 10 days for a potential hurricane to cross the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Cape Verde storms start over Africa where the hot dry air in the Sahara and the hot humid air over the Gulf of Guinea clash and create clusters of thunderstorms that move off the continent.",
      "The warm water is the first ingredient. Hurricanes also thrive with light winds above them that won\u2019t blow the thunderstorms away from the center.",
      "\u201cThey are the strongest because they have the most time to develop. The other storms can crash into land too early,\u201d Masters said.)",

The dust can travel all the way across the ocean and settle on cars and windows on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "\u201cThey travel about a mile above the surface, the winds are very strong, and the air is dry and hot. That\u2019s a trifecta that suppresses hurricane activity,\" Jason Dunion, a scientist at the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies told the university.",
      "Some years may not see a Cape Verde storm at all. Some can see as many as four or five. But on average about one or two hurricanes a year are classified as Cape Verde storms, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "And they aren't the only storms to hit the U.S. The Weather Channel analyzed hurricanes since 1995 and found only nine of the 60 that struck the U.S. were the ones that track all the way across the Atlantic.",
      "The list of famous Cape Verde hurricanes has a lot of overlap with the list of the most memorable, powerful and deadliest hurricanes.",
      "There is the 1900 Galveston Hurricane that killed about 8,000 people in Texas and the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane that killed 2,500 in Florida. In more recent times, hurricanes Donna in 1960 in Florida, Hugo in 1989 in South Carolina, Andrew in 1992 in Florida, Ivan in Grand Cayman, Alabama and Florida in 2004, Ike in Texas in 2008, Irma in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Florida in 2017 and Florence in North Carolina in 2018 were all Cape Verde storms.",

      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder. He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the\u00a0two people\u00a0who did. He rejected the state's offer to settle with a guilty plea last month,\u00a0CBS affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

      "British actor Terence Stamp, who famously played arch-villain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II,\" has died at the age of 87, his family said.",
      "The Oscar-nominated actor died on Sunday morning, his family told Reuters in a statement. His death was also disclosed in a death notice published online. The cause was not immediately known.",
      "\"He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,\" the statement to Reuters said. \"We ask for privacy at this sad time.\"",
      "Stamp was born in London's East End in 1938 to Ethel Esther and Thomas Stamp, a tugboat stoker. After enduring the bombing of London during World War II, Stamp left school to work in advertising before winning a scholarship for drama school, Reuters reported.",
      "\"I couldn't tell anyone I wanted to be an actor because it was out of the question. I would have been laughed at,\" he said, according to Reuters.",
      "Stamp started his film career with 1962's seafaring \"Billy Budd,\" for which he earned an Oscar nomination.",
      "During his six-decade acclaimed career, Stamp starred in films including Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Theorem,\" \"A Season in Hell,\" and \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" in which he played a transgender woman.",
      "\"From wearing the high heels, my spine was completely out of alignment, and it took me about six months to get my spine re-orchestrated,\" he told CBS News in 1999 about the downsides of the 1994 film.",
      "Stamp was also widely praised for his lead in director Steven Soderbergh's 1999 crime drama \"The Limey.\"",
      "Stamp's most high-profile role was likely as General Zod, the megalomaniacal leader of the Kryptonians, in 1978's \"Superman\" and its 1980 sequel \"Superman II.\" He returned to the Superman world when he played Jor-El in the TV series \"Smallville.\"",
      "He went on to appear in a string of other films, including \"Valkyrie\" opposite Tom Cruise, \"The Adjustment Bureau\" with Matt Damon, \"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace,\" and movies directed by Tim Burton.",

    "summary": "Whimsical and romantic, the music of Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir blends pop, jazz, classical and bossa nova \u2013 a \"mishmash,\" she calls it. Her latest album is \"A Matter of Time.\"",
    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",

The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",

      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",

      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called on Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his appointees accused her of mortgage fraud.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. A Federal Reserve spokesperson said they did not have anything to share at the time.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street views it as likely that Mr. Trump's wish for a rate cut will soon be granted, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing a new rule that would bar people with outstanding college loans\u00a0from relief on that debt if their employers were found to be \"undermining national security and American values through illegal means.\"",
      "The proposed rule,\u00a0announced Monday by the Department of Education, would restrict people from participating in the federal Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program if the organization they work for is found to be engaging in certain illegal activities.",
      "\"President Trump has given the Department a historic mandate to restore the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to its original purpose \u2014 supporting public servants who strengthen their communities and serve the public good, not benefiting businesses engaged in illegal activity that harm Americans,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The loan program, which was launched in 2007 under President George W. Bush, is aimed at helping public employees such as teachers and police officers shed student loan debt.",
      "The proposed rule lists some examples of what sorts of activities would be considered illegal, potentially resulting in an organization's workers being excluded from the public service loan program. Those include assessments that an organization is\u00a0aiding and abetting terrorism, violations of immigration laws, and what the rule describes as the \"chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.\"",
      "If an individual with outstanding student loans works for an employer deemed ineligible for the PSLF, the person could still participate in the program but would have to switch to an eligible employer, according to the proposed rule.",
      "President Trump spurred the new rulemaking process in March by issuing an\u00a0executive order\u00a0that directed the Secretary of Education to revise the public service loan forgiveness program. The Education Department is soliciting public comments on the proposed rule until Sept. 17.",
      "The White House and the Education Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Department of Education said the proposed regulations are necessary to preserve the original intent of the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program, which is to reward public service. The agency also said it wants to protect Americans to ensure their tax dollars do not support organizations engaged in \"unlawful activity.\"",
      "\"The proposed rules would halt PSLF benefits to employees of organizations that are undermining national security and American values through illegal means, and therefore not providing a public service,\" the Education Department said in a statement.",
      "Critics of the draft regulation said it would allow Education Department officials to improperly exclude some public servants from loan relief under the federal program. The Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group, said in a July\u00a0blog post\u00a0that the rule would give the Education Department broad authority to restrict funding to groups whose work conflicts with the Trump administration's agenda.",
      "\"To be clear, if implemented this proposal would allow the secretary [of education] to disqualify from PSLF any employees of school systems that accurately teach the U.S.' history of slavery, of health care providers who offer gender-affirming care and of legal aid organizations that represent individuals against unlawful deportations,\" Winston Berkman-Breen, legal director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in a June 30 public hearing\u00a0on the proposal.",
      "Introduced as part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, the public service loan program cancels outstanding debt for borrowers who make 120 monthly payments, or 10 years worth of payments. Currently, the program provides benefits to all government employers and all qualifying 501(c)(3) employers.",

    "summary": "Some packages of Great Value frozen shrimp sold at Walmart are at risk for potential for Cesium-137 contamination, the FDA says.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart said it is recalling some frozen shrimp after the Food and Drug Administration warned that the seafood items, sold under the Great Value label, are at risk of radioactive contamination and shouldn't be consumed.",
      "The frozen shrimp were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati and sold at Walmart stores as Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, the FDA said on Tuesday. The agency noted it has recommended that Walmart recall the product.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate,\" Walmart said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",

      "What should you do if you bought the shrimp?",
      "Consumers who bought the shrimp cited in the FDA's notice should throw it away, the agency said.",
      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

      "The credit ratings agency, which issued its new assessment of the nation's fiscal health late Monday, said that it is holding its AA+/A-1+ rating steady, with a stable outlook.",
      "The fresh analysis comes after Moody's Ratings, another large credit ratings agency, downgraded the U.S. in May, highlighting investor concerns about the nation's growing debt and policy uncertainty sparked by President Trump's trade policies. While S&P highlighted a range of economic concerns in its report, including the impact of new tax cuts against a backdrop of already high U.S. debt and deficits, the agency also underscored the resiliency of the nation's economy as well as the new tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Amid the rise in effective tariff rates, we expect meaningful tariff revenue to generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes that might otherwise be associated with the recent fiscal legislation, which contains both cuts and increases in tax and spending,\" S&P analysts wrote in the ratings note.",
      "The report added, \"The ratings on the U.S. are based on its wealthy, diversified and resilient economy, with per capita GDP over $89,000 in 2025. Since the pandemic, U.S. growth has far surpassed that of its peers.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The fresh ratings assessment comes as the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with GDP decelerating to an average rate of 1.25% during the first half of the year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The job market also faltered in July, with employers adding a disappointing 73,000 jobs last month,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department \u2014 far fewer than economists had forecast.",
      "The weak jobs data suggests that businesses are delaying hiring amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's new tariff regime, which has been exacerbated by numerous postponements and rate changes.",
      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:03:41 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

      "Additionally, some of the knockoffs are so poorly made that they can break into small pieces that children could insert in their mouths. The CPSC warned consumers not to buy the fakes and to immediately stop using any of faux dolls they may own.",
      "\"These fake Labubu dolls are dangerous, illegal and have no place in American homes,\" CPSC Acting Chairman Peter Feldman said in a statement. \"No parent should have to wonder if a toy will stop their child from breathing. Protect your children and buy only from reputable sellers.\"",

      "How to spot a fake \"Lafufu\"",
      "Deeply discounted Labubu dolls can indicate that the products are inauthentic, according to the CPSC. Look for a holographic Pop Mart sticker and scannable QR code to identify real Labubu. Newer authentic Labubus also bear what the CPSC describes as a discrete UV stamp on one foot.",
      "A doll's teeth can also betray a fake \u2014 authentic Labubus have nine, while imitations sometimes have a different number. And fakes can be brighter than the real dolls, according to the CPSC.",

    "summary": "The union representing 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants says it's reached a tentative agreement with the carrier and their strike, which had entered its fourth day, is over.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Air Canada said Tuesday it will restart operations gradually after a tentative agreement was reached with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers.",
      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back \u2014 and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",
      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",
      "\"Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,\" the union said in a post on its website.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day. The airline estimated Monday that 500,000 customers would be affected by flight cancellations.",

      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",

      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",

      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

      "Mark Hancock, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a news conference in Montreal on Monday that the union will remain on strike.",
      "\"We're telling our flight attendants we're going to support them,\" Hancock said.",
      "CIRB declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants illegal Monday and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration.",
      "The strike at Canada's largest airline entered its third day on Monday and is affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season, and the two sides remain far apart on pay and other issues. Air Canada suspended plans to restart operations Sunday after the union defied an earlier return-to-work order.",
      "\"The members of the union's bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,\" the Canada Industrial Relations Board board, or CIRB, said in a written decision.",
      "The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws, said the union needs to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties.",
      "It was not immediately clear what recourse the board or the Canadian government has in the face of the union's continued refusal.",
      "\"We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,\" Prime Minister Mark Carney said. \"I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Asked on Monday what kind of repercussions the union was willing to face for its defiance of the labor board's return to works orders, Hancock said, \"There's no limit. We're going to stay strong.\"",
      "\"If it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it,\" he added.",
      "Despite refusing to comply with the back-to-work order, Hancock also said the union is committed to reaching a deal.",
      "Air Canada had canceled 600 flights as of 4:03 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, according to FlightAware.com. Air Canada Rouge had 131 flight cancellations, the flight tracking and data provider showed.",
      "Second return-to-work order",
      "Air Canada's plans to restart operations were first suspended on Sunday after the union said it would defy a return to work order. The strike was already affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season.",
      "CIRB had first ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday after the government intervened and Air Canada said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening.",
      "Canada's largest airline initially said early on Monday that it would resume flights that evening, adding in a statement that the union \"illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.\"",
      "After the Canadian union's second refusal to end its work stoppage, the airline updated its website Monday afternoon to say that Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations remain suspended.",
      "\"Rolling cancellations now extend until 16:00 EDT of August 19, 2025,\" a statement on Air Canada's site read.",
      "\"Over half a million customers have been impacted by this illegal strike, and we want to see an end to it,\" Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau told BNN Bloomberg on Monday.",
      "The labor board first ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday and for the union to enter arbitration, after the government intervened. Air Canada then said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening. But when the workers refused, the airline said it would resume flights Monday evening instead. However, there was no sign that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, would relent.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "What Air Canada is offering",
      "Union leader Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",
      "\"Air Canada's intended restart of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, which have been grounded since Aug. 16 by CUPE's labour disruption, was prevented on Aug. 17 by the CUPE leadership's unlawful strike activities,\" Air Canada said in a statement on Monday. \"Air Canada regrets this impact on its customers and is fully committed to returning to service as soon as possible.\"",
      "The airline now estimates 500,000 customers' flights have been canceled as a result. Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.",
      "Last year, the government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.",

The second data breach, announced in\u00a0July 2024, involved hackers unlawfully downloading AT&T data from a third-party cloud platform, exposing the records of calls and texts of \"nearly all\" of AT&T's cellular customers.",
      "Multiple lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts across the country after both incidents, which were ultimately consolidated into two class-action cases.",
      "Following a ruling from a federal judge, the settlement administration for AT&T\u00a0said on Aug. 4 that a proposed settlement has been reached for $177 million, with $149 million earmarked for the first settlement class and $28 million set aside for the second settlement class.",
      "The settlement, however, still has to be approved. According to the settlement website, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing on Dec. 3, 2025. In the meantime, impacted AT&T customers can file for compensation.",
      "Here's more information on how to submit a claim.",

      "How do I file a claim?",
      "To receive part of the settlement, impacted AT&T customers have to fill out this claim form\u00a0online by Nov. 18, 2025. Customers can also mail the form to AT&T Data Incident Settlement, c/o Kroll Settlement Administration LLC, P.O. Box 5324, New York, NY 10150-5324. It must be postmarked by November 18.",
      "As stated on the settlement website, if you file a claim, you give up your right to sue AT&T.",
      "How much will I get?",
      "People whose data was exposed in the breach announced in March 2024 are eligible for up to $5,000 and can make claims for \"payment for losses that occurred in 2019, or later,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "Those who were part of the second breach announced in July of last year are eligible for up to $2,500 \"for losses that occurred on or after April 14, 2024,\" the settlement administration said.",
      "In both cases, customers must provide documentation showing that the losses they incurred are \"fairly traceable\" to the AT&T data breaches. Proof can include receipts and other documents \"not self-prepared by the claimant that documents the costs incurred,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "If your information was part of both breaches, you could be eligible for up to $7,500. That would make you part what the settlement administration calls a \"overlap settlement class member.\"",
      "When could I get a payment?",
      "Not until December, at the earliest. If the court approves the settlement at the Dec. 3 hearing, there could be appeals after that, which would take time to resolve.",

    "summary": "Miners want to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
    "story": [
      "A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\"These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\" said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \"Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\"",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres, rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "Dramatic landscape changes come with modern mining",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

      "Old shipping containers are plentiful in the U.S., and architect Brian Stark knows exactly what to do with them.",
      "He began by designing buildings out of old shipping containers, which are scattered across the streetscape of Phoenix. His projects are as much about cost-saving as they are about being environmentally friendly, with the long-term goal of helping tackle America's affordable housing crisis.",
      "\"We're not consuming or producing that steel, it already exists,\" Stark said. \"There's a huge ability to save. And that's how I think we have to start thinking that way, is using what we have versus just keep on consuming.\"",
      "How the design process works",
      "Stark took his concept a step further and began designing homes for Phoenix's unhoused people out of the steel containers. The project was developed for the City of Phoenix with sustainable living company Steel + Spark, and the housing units are called \"X-WING\" shelters as an ode to the unit's \"X\" design.",
      "Each \"X-WING\" is made up of four containers, topped with solar panels and joined together in an \"X\" shape that also creates courtyards for its residents when placed beside another unit. Each container has five rooms, with one resident per room. The units are fully air-conditioned, which is crucial for a city that reaches record temperatures every year.",
      "Most importantly, the shelters only take a week to construct.",
      "Jay Spicer, who lives in one of the \"X-WING\" rooms with his dog, Dino, qualified for the unit by staying sober for eight months and holding a job as a forklift operator.",

      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",

      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. A Federal Reserve spokesperson said they did not have anything to share at the time.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street views it as likely that Mr. Trump's wish for a rate cut will soon be granted, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

      "She accused them of having engaged in the \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence\" to advance personal or partisan goals, failing to safeguard classified information, failing to \"adhere to professional analytic tradecraft standards\" and other \"detrimental\" conduct that she did not describe in the memo.",

      "Some of the officials worked on matters that have long infuriated President Trump, like the intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. And several showed their concerns about Mr. Trump by signing a critical letter in 2019 that was highlighted on social media last month by right-wing provocateur and close Trump ally Laura Loomer.",
      "The action reflects Mr. Trump's ongoing distrust of career intelligence officials whom he perceives as working against his interests. The revocation of clearances is a tactic the administration has used before \u2014 it has revoked the clearances of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several others. Critics say the tactic risks chilling dissenting voices from an intelligence community accustomed to drawing on a range of viewpoints before formulating an assessment. In Mr. Trump's first term, he\u00a0revoked\u00a0former CIA Director John Brennan's clearance.",
      "\"These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,\" Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer whose own clearance has been revoked by the Trump administration, said in a statement.",
      "He called it hypocritical for the administration to \"claim these individuals politicized or weaponized intelligence.\"",
      "Gabbard on Tuesday sought to defend the move, which she said had been directed by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" she wrote on X. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Gabbard and other Trump administration officials have revisited the intelligence community assessment published in 2017 on Russian election interference, including by declassifying a series of years-old documents meant to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its findings.",
      "Multiple government investigations have reached the same conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping fashion, including through a hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails and a social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long resisted the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in his favor, and his Justice Department has authorized a grand jury investigation that could bring fresh scrutiny to Obama-era officials.",
      "Security clearances are important not only for current government workers but also former employees whose private-sector jobs require them to retain access to sensitive information. Stripping clearances from such employees could make it hard for them to do their jobs, though it's unclear how many of the former officials still have or require one.",
      "On his first day of office, Mr. Trump said he would revoke the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a \"Russian information operation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has attempted to revoke the security clearances for lawyers at a number of prominent law firms but was rebuffed by federal judges.",
      "Some of those who were targeted in the latest action were part of Biden's national security team.

      "The guidance issued Tuesday also orders USCIS officials to probe whether applicants improperly used an immigration policy known as parole to enter the U.S. In the immigration context, parole allows for the arrival of immigrants who are otherwise ineligible to enter the U.S. It was used by the Biden administration on an unprecedented scale, mainly to ease pressure at the U.S.-Mexico border by offering migrants a legal way to enter the country.",
      "USCIS said it would look into whether applicants' parole applications contained \"false or fraudulent\" information.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, USCIS' top spokesperson, said Tuesday's memo underscored that U.S. immigration benefits should not be granted to people who \"despise the country.\"",
      "\"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, expressed concerns about how USCIS would implement its latest guidance, calling the language in it \"very subjective.\"",
      "\"This memo gives USCIS adjudicators even more reasons than before to deny a petition on discretionary grounds,\" Yale-Loehr said.",
      "While President Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration central to his second-term agenda, his administration has also tightened access to the legal immigration system.",
      "Last week, USCIS said it would expand a \"good moral character\" assessment in the U.S. citizenship process. That requirement was historically satisfied when applicants lacked serious criminal histories or disqualifying conduct on their record. But now, officials have been instructed to weigh different positive factors, like applicants' involvement in the community, and negative factors, like repeat traffic infractions, to determine whether someone has good moral character.",
      "The Trump administration also previously announced measures to more aggressively screen those applying for a U.S. immigration status, including by placing a greater emphasis on the social media activity of applicants.",

    "summary": "As states prepare to implement changes to Medicaid required by President Trump's recent tax-and-spending law, tribal leaders say they are concerned Native American enrollees could lose their coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Jonnell Wieder earned too much money at her job to keep her Medicaid coverage when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended in 2023 and states resumed checking whether people were eligible for the program. But she was reassured by the knowledge that Medicaid would provide postpartum coverage for her and her daughter, Oakleigh McDonald, who was born in July of that year.",
      "Wieder is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana and can access some health services for free through her tribe's health clinics. But funding is limited, so, like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid for herself and Oakleigh.",
      "Months before Oakleigh's first birthday, the date when Wieder's postpartum coverage would come to an end, Wieder completed and returned paperwork to enroll her daughter in Healthy Montana Kids, the state's version of the Children's Health Insurance Program. But her paperwork, caught up in the lengthy delays and processing times for applications, did not go through.",
      "\"As soon as she turned 1, they cut her off completely,\" Wieder said.",
      "It took six months for Wieder to get Oakleigh covered again through Healthy Montana Kids. Before health workers in her tribe stepped in to help her resubmit her application, Wieder repeatedly called the state's health department. She said she would dial the call center when she arrived at her job in the morning and go about her work while waiting on hold, only for the call to be dropped by the end of the day.",
      "\"Never did I talk to anybody,\" she said.",
      "Wieder and Oakleigh's experience is an example of the chaos for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries caused by the process known as the \"unwinding,\" which led to millions of people in the U.S. losing coverage due to paperwork or other procedural issues. Now, tribal health leaders fear their communities will experience more health coverage disruptions when new federal Medicaid work and eligibility requirements are implemented by the start of 2027.",
      "The tax-and-spending law that President Trump signed this summer exempts Native Americans from the new requirement that some people work or do another qualifying activity a minimum number of hours each month to be eligible for Medicaid, as well as from more frequent eligibility checks. But as Wieder and her daughter's experience shows, they are not exempt from getting caught up in procedural disenrollments that could reemerge as states implement the new rules.",
      "\"We also know from the unwinding that that just doesn't always play out necessarily correctly in practice,\" said Joan Alker, who leads Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"There's a lot to worry about.\"",
      "The new law is projected to increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million.",
      "The lessons of the unwinding suggest that \"deep trouble\" lies ahead for Native Americans who rely on Medicaid, according to Alker.",
      "Changes to Medicaid",
      "Mr. Trump's new law changes Medicaid rules to require some recipients ages 19 to 64 to log 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month. It also requires states to recheck those recipients' eligibility every six months, instead of annually. Both of these changes will be effective by the end of next year.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that the law would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade. In addition, more than 4 million people enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to become uninsured if Congress allows pandemic-era enhanced premium tax credits to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Wieder said she was lucky that the tribe covered costs and her daughter's care wasn't interrupted in the six months she didn't have health insurance. Citizens of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. can access some free health services through the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But free care is limited because Congress has historically failed to fully fund the Indian Health Service. Tribal health systems rely heavily on Medicaid to fill that gap. Native Americans are enrolled in Medicaid at higher rates than the White population and have higher rates of chronic illnesses, die more from preventable diseases, and have less access to care.",
      "Medicaid is the largest third-party payer to the Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities and organizations. Accounting for about two-thirds of the outside revenue the Indian Health Service collects, it helps tribal health organizations pay their staff, maintain or expand services, and build infrastructure. Tribal leaders say protecting Medicaid for Indian Country is a responsibility Congress and the federal government must fulfill as part of their trust and treaty obligations to tribes.",
      "Lessons learned during the unwinding",
      "The Trump administration prevented states from disenrolling most Medicaid recipients for the duration of the public health emergency starting in 2020. After those eligibility checks resumed in 2023, nearly 27 million people nationwide were disenrolled from Medicaid during the unwinding, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office published in June. The majority of disenrollments \u2014 about 70% \u2014 occurred for procedural reasons, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "CMS did not require state agencies to collect race and ethnicity data for their reporting during the unwinding, making it difficult to determine how many Native American and Alaska Native enrollees lost coverage.",
      "The lack of data to show how the unwinding affected the population makes it difficult to identify disparities and create policies to address them, said Latoya Hill, senior policy manager with KFF's Racial Equity and Health Policy program. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "The National Council of Urban Indian Health, which advocates on public health issues for Native Americans living in urban parts of the nation, analyzed the Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey and KFF data in an effort to understand how disenrollment affected tribes. The council estimated more than 850,000 Native Americans had lost coverage as of May 2024. About 2.7 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, according to the council.",
      "The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that represents and advocates for federally recognized tribes, has been working with federal Medicaid officials to ensure that state agencies are prepared to implement the exemptions.",
      "\"We learned a lot of lessons about state capacity during the unwinding,\" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.",
      "Nevada health officials say they plan to apply lessons learned during the unwinding and launch a public education campaign on the Medicaid changes in the new federal law. \"A lot of this will depend on anticipated federal guidance regarding the implementation of those new rules,\" said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority.",
      "Staff at the Fallon Tribal Health Center in Nevada have become authorized representatives for some of their patients. This means that tribal citizens' Medicaid paperwork is sent to the health center, allowing staff to notify individuals and help them fill it out.",
      "Davis said the unwinding process showed that Native American enrollees are uniquely vulnerable to procedural disenrollment. The new law's exemption of Native Americans from work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks is the \"bare minimum\" to ensure unnecessary disenrollments are avoided as part of trust and treaty obligations, Davis said.",
      "Eligibility checks are \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\"",
      "The GAO said the process of determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\" in a 2024 report on the unwinding.",
      "\"The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on such a large scale further compounded this complexity,\" the report said.",
      "It highlighted weaknesses across state systems. By April 2024, federal Medicaid officials had found nearly all states were out of compliance with redetermination requirements, according to the GAO. Eligible people lost their coverage, the accountability office said, highlighting the need to improve federal oversight.",
      "In Texas, for example, federal Medicaid officials found that 100,000 eligible people had been disenrolled due to, for example, the state system's failure to process their completed renewal forms or miscalculation of the length of women's postpartum coverage.",
      "Some states were not conducting ex parte renewals, in which a person's Medicaid coverage is automatically renewed based on existing information available to the state. That reduces the chance that paperwork is sent to the wrong address, because the recipient doesn't need to complete or return renewal forms.",
      "But poorly conducted ex parte renewals can lead to procedural disenrollments, too. More than 100,000 people in Nevada were disenrolled by September 2023 through the ex parte process. The state had been conducting the ex parte renewals at the household level, rather than by individual beneficiary, resulting in the disenrollment of still-eligible children because their parents were no longer eligible. Ninety-three percent of disenrollments in the state were for procedural reasons \u2014 the highest in the nation, according to KFF.",
      "Another issue the federal agency identified was that some state agencies were not giving enrollees the opportunity to submit their renewal paperwork through all means available, including mail, phone, online, and in person.",
      "State agencies also identified challenges they faced during the unwinding, including an unprecedented volume of eligibility redeterminations, insufficient staffing and training, and a lack of response from enrollees who may not have been aware of the unwinding.",
      "Native Americans and Alaska Natives have unique challenges in maintaining their coverage.",
      "Communities in rural parts of the nation experience issues with receiving and sending mail. Some Native Americans on reservations may not have street addresses. Others may not have permanent housing or change addresses frequently. In Alaska, mail service is often disrupted by severe weather. Another issue is the lack of reliable internet service on remote reservations.",
      "Tribal health leaders and patient benefit coordinators said some tribal citizens did not receive their redetermination paperwork or struggled to fill it out and send it back to their state Medicaid agency.",
      "The aftermath",
      "Although the unwinding is over, many challenges persist.",
      "Tribal health workers in Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota said some eligible patients who lost Medicaid during the unwinding had still not been reenrolled as of this spring.",
      "\"Even today, we're still in the trenches of getting individuals that had been disenrolled back onto Medicaid,\" said Rachel Arthur, executive director of the Indian Family Health Clinic in Great Falls, Montana, in May.",
      "Arthur said staff at the clinic realized early in the unwinding that their patients were not receiving their redetermination notices in the mail. The clinic is identifying people who fell off Medicaid during the unwinding and helping them fill out applications.",
      "Marlena Farnes, who was a patient benefit coordinator at the Indian Family Health Clinic during the Medicaid unwinding, said she tried for months to help an older patient with a chronic health condition get back on Medicaid. He had completed and returned his paperwork but still received a notice that his coverage had lapsed. After many calls to the state Medicaid office, Farnes said, state officials told her the patient's application had been lost.",
      "Another patient went to the emergency room multiple times while uninsured, Arthur said.",
      "\"I felt like if our patients weren't helped with follow-up, and that advocacy piece, their applications were not being seen,\" Farnes said. She is now the behavioral health director at the clinic.",
      "Montana was one of five states where more than 50% of enrollees lost coverage during the unwinding, according to the GAO. The other states are Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. About 68% of Montanans who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons.",
      "In Oklahoma, eligibility redeterminations remain challenging to process, said Yvonne Myers, a Medicaid and Affordable Care Act consultant for Citizen Potawatomi Nation Health Services. That's causing more frequent coverage lapses, she said.",
      "Myers said she thinks Republican claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" are overstated.",
      "\"I challenge some of them to try to go through an eligibility process,\" Myers said. \"The way they're going about it is making it for more hoops to jump through, which ultimately will cause people to fall off.\"",
      "The unwinding showed that state systems can struggle to respond quickly to changes in Medicaid, leading to preventable erroneous disenrollments. Individuals were often in the dark about their applications and struggled to reach state offices for answers. Tribal leaders and health experts are raising concerns that those issues will continue and worsen as states implement the requirements of the new law.",
      "Georgia, the only state with an active Medicaid work requirement program, has shown that the changes can be difficult for individuals to navigate and costly for a state to implement. More than 100,000 people have applied for Georgia's Pathways program, but only about 8,600 were enrolled as of the end of July.",
      "Alker, of Georgetown, said Congress took the wrong lesson from the unwinding in adding more restrictions and red tape.",
      "\"It will make unwinding pale in comparison in terms of the number of folks that are going to lose coverage,\" Alker said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 23:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Details are emerging about the possible motivation behind the firing of five senior FBI agents.",
    "story": [
      "When the FBI fired five veteran agents earlier this month, Director Kash Patel offered no explanation.",
      "Shock at the firings has continued to reverberate through the storied agency. And now, details are emerging about the possible motivation, several sources close to the agents tell CBS News.",
      "\"There is a despicable purge underway of senior FBI officials, all of whom have risen in their careers as nonpartisan, and who have been targeted for vindictive, political purposes,\" said Mark Zaid, a whistleblower attorney who represents a number of federal workers dismissed under President Trump.",
      "Without any public comment from FBI or Justice Department officials, the agents, including, Brian Driscoll, who served for a short time as acting director at the start of the Trump administration, and Steven Jensen, head of the powerful Washington field office, were summarily fired and given little explanation for their removal. None had reached retirement age, meaning the abrupt dismissals will deprive them of their full pensions. One agent's expulsion came a month after his wife died of cancer.",
      "CBS News spoke with multiple sources close to the agents for this story. All of those interviewed spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of retribution.",
      "By outward appearances, former acting FBI director was in good standing",
      "Some of the agents may have been targeted solely because they worked on one or more of the criminal investigations of Mr. Trump, while others who were ousted in an earlier spate of firings worked on the Biden administration's Jan. 6 investigations, sources close to the agents said. But the most senior agent, Driscoll, by outward appearances, was in good standing with Patel.",
      "Driscoll, a highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, began his short stint as acting director with what many agents viewed as a singular act of bravery, resisting calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who had participated in the Jan. 6 investigation. Nevertheless, Patel kept Driscoll on after his Senate confirmation, putting him in a high-profile post as head of the bureau's Critical Incident Response Group, which oversees the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team and its aviation unit.",
      "Jensen, a veteran agent who helped oversee the Jan. 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, was given a significant promotion by Patel to be the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, one of the largest outposts in the country.",
      "One source with knowledge of the matter told CBS News that Patel relied on both agents and particularly admired Driscoll, whom he viewed as a swashbuckling tactical operator. Another said that the FBI director opposed some of the firings. \"I think Kash tried to save these people, honestly,\" the source said.",
      "Yet there are also some indications that both men may have crossed FBI leadership over loyalty and personnel matters.",
      "Some agents suspect political interference",
      "Zaid is part of a team of lawyers preparing to sue the federal government on behalf of some of the fired FBI agents. He told CBS News he suspects outside political interference.",
      "\"If you look at Patel's testimony from his confirmation hearing when he promised the committee there would be no politicization or retribution at the FBI under his leadership,\" Zaid told CBS News, \"you have to conclude that he was either lying or, giving him the benefit of the doubt, that he was directed to take these actions, and that could only come from the White House or the Justice Department.\"",
      "Patel promised senators during that hearing, \"There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI, should I be confirmed as FBI director.\"",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill see the firings as baldly political and damaging to U.S. national security. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that he believes agents should be commended for their ability to enforce the law impartially.",
      "\"When we start purging agents for doing their jobs, instead of toeing a partisan line, we weaken our defense against everything from violent crime to foreign threats, and that makes us all less safe,\" Warner said.",
      "When asked who ordered the termination of the agents, the FBI declined to comment. A White House official deferred to the FBI to discuss bureau personnel matters.",
      "\"The suspendables\"",
      "There are other factors that have led some sources close to the agents and lawyers representing them to question whether the abrupt removals were the result of outside political interference, possibly by the White House.",
      "One question surrounds the role of a small band of right-leaning former agents who clashed with FBI leadership under directors James Comey and Christopher Wray and have been vocal critics of a bureau they believe was \"weaponized\" against them.",
      "Among them is Kyle Seraphin, one of several former FBI agents and whistleblowers who were suspended or had their security clearances revoked for alleged misconduct during the Biden administration. The former agents, including Seraphin, have referred to themselves as \"the suspendables.\" They have been targeting FBI officials they believe to be politically motivated.",
      "Seraphin has been among the most outspoken \u2013 and effective \u2013 members of the group. He has at times been critical of Patel for not aggressively and swiftly cleaning house at the bureau, but he has also had Patel's ear. Sources say he exercises considerable influence from his social media perch on X and his podcast, \"The Kyle Seraphin Show.\"",
      "Seraphin has publicly claimed some of the credit for last week's purge. On August 4, he posted a thread on X under the heading \"VETTING CRISIS CONTINUES,\" in which he identified one of the fired agents, Christopher M. Meyer. Meyer had been serving as one of the pilots of the governmental planes used by Patel until he was notified of his termination.",
      "Seraphin had publicly speculated, correctly it turned out, that Meyer had previously been on a squad based in the Washington Field Office that investigated Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and conducted a search of Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department brought criminal charges against Mr. Trump over the discovery of documents, but a judge eventually dismissed the case.",
      "Seraphin told CBS News in an interview, \"I identified that the person that ran the Mar-a-Lago case that resulted in a search warrant at the president's home was rubbing shoulders in close proximity with the FBI director\" as his pilot. He was concerned that \"this is a person that's now in the kind of buddy space of your FBI director, and he doesn't even know who he's speaking to.\"",
      "On Alex Jones's \"InfoWars\" he said he gave a \"heads up\" to an \"administration insider\" about Meyer. He told CBS News his \"Trump administration insider\" was \"in the president's orbit.\"",
      "How the firings unfolded",
      "On that same day, Patel directed Driscoll to fire Meyer, sources told CBS News. When Driscoll asked on what grounds, he did not get what he considered a satisfactory answer from Patel, according to the source.\u00a0 Without itr, Driscoll refused. Two days later, on Aug. 6, Driscoll was contacted by J. William Rivers, the No. 3 official at the FBI, and told he was being terminated, the source said. He was given no reason why but later received a letter formally notifying him that he was being fired.",
      "Around the same time, Jensen was also relieved of his duties. A source with knowledge of that matter said it was because he, too, refused to fire a subordinate agent in the Washington Field Office, though CBS News was not able to identify the person. Walter Giardina, a WFO agent\u00a0 who was also dismissed in the purge, had worked on a number of cases involving Mr. Trump and other members of his administration, including the prosecution of senior Trump aide Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress.",
      "The fifth agent fired earlier this month was Spencer Evans, who had been the special agent in charge of the FBI's Nevada field office until earlier this summer, when he was abruptly told he was being transferred to Huntsville, Alabama. By then, Trump supporters, including Seraphin, had been publicly critical of him over his enforcement of FBI COVID policies during the tenure of former FBI Director Christpher Wray.",
      "In April, Seraphin posted this on X:",
      "\"After @Kash_Patel was nominated, he asked me about people in the FBI who were problems. I said Spencer Evans, the SAC of Las Vegas, was the man who PERSONALLY denied the religious accommodations for Covid 19 shots and testing protocols.\"",
      "Seraphin's post continued: \"Kash said 'Gone.'\"",
      "Seraphin attached a video to his post that showed that months after that conversation, Evans was still leading the Las Vegas FBI office, and Patel was praising its work in tracking down criminals.",
      "Then, last Wednesday, two hours before getting into his car to drive across the country for his new assignment, Evans received a call notifying him that he too was being terminated. He was given no reason.",
      "Two days later Evans received a formal termination letter signed by Patel. It said Evans \"demonstrated a lack of reasonableness and overzealousness in the implementation of COVID-19 protocols and policies.\"",
      "After the August firings, Seraphin told CBS News a colleague in the FBI said to him, \"You have four scalps hanging off your belt this week.\" Seraphin excluded Driscoll from the count, and referred to him as \"collateral damage,\" and said he probably didn't deserve to be fired.",

      "Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced plans Tuesday for an immigration detention center in a farming area in the state's southwest corner as President Trump's administration\u00a0races to expand\u00a0the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.",
      "Pillen said he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had agreed to use an existing minimum security prison work camp in rural McCook to house people awaiting deportation and being held for other immigration proceedings.",
      "The new facility was dubbed the \"Cornhusker Clink\" last week by Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. It can accommodate 200 people with plans to expand to 300. McCook is about 210 miles west of Lincoln, the state capital.",
      "\"This is about keeping Nebraskans \u2013 and Americans across our country \u2013 safe,\" Pillen said in a statement.",
      "Pillen announced he would order the Nebraska National Guard to provide administrative and logistical support to Nebraska-based immigration agents. About 20 Guard soldiers will be involved.",
      "He also said the Nebraska State Patrol would sign an agreement that enables troopers to help federal immigration agents make arrests.",
      "DHS said in a news release that the agreement with the state to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention space was made possible by Mr. Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0passed by Congress last month. The funding bill included $45 billion for ICE to expand its detention system, and nearly $30 billion for ICE agents and resources.",
      "Jeffreys said the 186 people currently at McCook will be transferred to other state corrections facilities so the camp can be repurposed.",
      "The facility will be run by the state of Nebraska but will be paid for by the federal government. All the people expected to be held there will be low to medium-risk detainees, Jeffreys said.",
      "Jeffreys estimated it will take 45 to 60 days to relocate all the current McCook population while a prison in Lincoln is undergoing repairs from recent storm damage. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly ICE might start sending detainees to McCook.",
      "But Jeffreys said it's already set up to house people, so detainees won't be housed in tents or other temporary quarters. \"That facility has already been accredited. It's ready in the event that we are to move our folks out and move detainees in,\" he said.",
      "\"Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country,\" Noem said in a statement Tuesday. \"If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska's Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.\"",
      "The Nebraska plan has already raised concerns.",
      "In a\u00a0video\u00a0posted to social media, state Sen. Megan Hunt, an independent, blasted a lack of transparency about plans for a detention center, citing her unfulfilled request to the governor and executive branch for emails and other records about the plan.",
      "She urged people to support local immigrant rights groups, and said any response by the Legislature would not come until next year \u2014 and only with enough support from lawmakers.",
      "\"The No. 1 thing we need to do is protect our neighbors, protect the people in our communities who are being targeted by these horrible people, these horrible organizations that are making choices to lock up, detain, disappear our neighbors and families and friends,\" Hunt said.",
      "Six protesters sat in the hallway outside the governor's office Tuesday afternoon making signs that said, \"No Nazi Nebraska\" and \"ICE = Gestapo.\"",
      "Maghie Miller-Jenkins of Lincoln said she doesn't think an ICE detention center is a good idea, adding the state should tackle problems like child hunger and homelessness. \"This state has numerous things they could focus on that would benefit the constituents,\" Miller-Jenkins said.",
      "The Trump administration is adding\u00a0new detention facilities across the country\u00a0to hold the growing number of immigrants it has arrested and accused of being in the country illegally. Older and newer U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers were holding more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.",

It's designed to hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. When Mr. Trump toured it,\u00a0he suggested it could be a model\u00a0for future lockups nationwide.",
      "When federal officials announced the opening of the Florida detention center, they said its focus would be on rounding up individuals with a criminal record \u2014 people that Mr. Trump and border czar Tom Homan have called\u00a0\"the worst of the worst.\"\u00a0However, many people who have been locked up there\u00a0do not have criminal records, CBS News previously reported.",
      "The Florida facility has also been the\u00a0subject of legal challenges\u00a0by attorneys who allege violations of due process there, including the rights of detainees to meet with their attorneys, limited access to immigration courts and poor living conditions.

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration \u2014 an idea she said was \"specifically at the request\" of President Trump.",
      "Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.",
      "She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.",
      "\"That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,\" Noem said.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.",
      "Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.",
      "\"The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,\" she said.",
      "She said that in addition to barriers like the one she visited Tuesday, the department is also working on \"water-borne infrastructure.\" Long sections of the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico sit along the Rio Grande River in Texas.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing forward with completing the wall at the same time that the number of people crossing the border illegally has plummeted. In the month of June, just over 6,000 migrants were apprehended along the southern border, a decades-long low \u2014 and a steep dropoff from the Biden administration, when border arrests peaked at upwards of 6,000 per day.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador only to be brought back to face smuggling charges \u2014 asked a federal judge to dismiss his indictment.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador only to be brought back to the U.S. to face smuggling charges, asked a federal judge in Nashville on Tuesday to dismiss his indictment, calling it a \"vindictive and selective prosecution\" by the Trump administration.",
      "The attorneys claimed the Trump administration is only prosecuting Abrego Garcia for alleged human smuggling crimes because he challenged his deportation to El Salvador, where he was initially held at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT. His lawyers have said their client was beaten at that prison before being transferred to a lower-level security facility.",
      "Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 at age 16 and was granted legal protection from being deported to his home country of El Salvador in 2019. But he was still arrested by immigration officials and deported there earlier this year.",
      "While the Trump administration initially conceded in federal court that his deportation to El Salvador had been a mistake, it has since sought to undermine Abrego Garcia's case in the court of public opinion, accusing him of being a gang member, highlighting domestic violence allegations and charging him with smuggling.",
      "Abrego Garcia has remained in pre-trial detention since he was flown back to the U.S. in early June. The Justice Department has alleged in its criminal indictment that before his deportation to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia transported immigrants, including minors, who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally as part of a smuggling conspiracy.",
      "One of the main pieces of evidence cited by prosecutors is a 2022 traffic stop during which Tennessee troopers stopped Abrego Garcia as he was driving eight\u00a0people without any luggage across state lines. Abrego Garcia's lawyers said it was telling that the federal government did not prosecute him until after his deportation, which gained widespread national attention.",
      "\"Indeed, the only possible explanation for the timing of the charges here is that the government chose to use this prosecution to punish Mr. Abrego for exercising his right to challenge the violations of due process that led to his unconstitutional deportation, incarceration, and torture in El Salvador,\" the lawyers said in a legal filing.",
      "\"This, coupled with the government's statements clearly showing the intent to retaliate against Mr. Abrego for pursuing civil remedies for his illegal deportation, unquestionably establishes discriminatory intent,\" the filing continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Trump administration had \"gone to extreme lengths to make a criminal case,\" including by using a convicted smuggler who has been deported five times as its \"star cooperator.\" They said the witness was getting lenient treatment from the government in exchange for his cooperation, even though he was purportedly the head of a smuggling business and Abrego Garcia was \"allegedly a mere driver.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers are also asking the federal court in Nashville to order their client's release from pre-trial detention once a stay on that order lapses on Friday, Aug. 22. While the court ordered Abrego Garcia's pre-trial release earlier this summer, it paused that order after his lawyers expressed concerns that their client would be immediately detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for deportation.",
      "If he's released, the lawyers asked the court to give Abrego Garcia 48 hours to report to pre-trial supervision in Maryland. If there's a release hearing, the lawyers asked the court to order the U.S. Marshals Service to transport Abrego Garcia from the court back to the detention facility where he's being held, so he can be released from there. The attorneys said they've hired a private security group to take Abrego Garcia from Tennessee to Maryland.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia to Maryland, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife and child, so he can be supervised by ICE there. She also blocked ICE from immediately re-detaining him in Tennessee and from deporting him without some degree of notice, but did not forbid the possibility of the agency re-arresting him in Maryland.",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives for the Department of Justice asking for comment on Tuesday's legal filings.",
      "In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia \"will never walk America's streets again,\" calling him a \"gang member and human trafficker.\"",

      "The governors of Mississippi and Louisiana\u00a0on Monday announced they would be sending 200 and 135 Guard troops, respectively. On Saturday, West Virginia said it was deploying between 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it would send 150 in the coming days.",

      "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",
      "\"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,\" Morrisey said.",

Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News on Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",

      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest.

      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said.

      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said.

      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",

      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",

    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida state officials \u2014 though other challenges over \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are still pending.",
      "Civil rights attorneys had sued the Trump administration and the state of Florida, seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure that detainees at the facility have confidential access to lawyers. It's the second lawsuit challenging practices at Alligator Alcatraz, a controversial detention facility that the Trump administration has cast as a symbol of its crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 along with a suit arguing the facility had skirted environmental rules.",
      "But after a hearing on Monday, Miami-based U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed one part of their suit that alleged the government was violating the Fifth Amendment because it hadn't made clear for weeks which immigration court had jurisdiction over Alligator Alcatraz, preventing detainees from filing court petitions. Ruiz ruled that this claim is now moot because the government has since said publicly that the court at the Krome Detention Center in South Florida will hear the detainees' claims.",
      "\"The Court can do no more,\" Ruiz wrote.",
      "The judge did not dismiss several other claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by allegedly making it difficult for detainees to talk to their lawyers, especially in confidential settings. Ruiz said that continues to be a \"live controversy.\" But he ordered the case to be transferred to a different federal court, because Alligator Alcatraz is technically within the boundaries of the Orlando-based Middle District of Florida.",
      "Eunice Cho, an attorney at the ACLU of Florida who served as lead counsel for the lawsuit, said in a statement: \"We secured an important victory \u2014 because of this lawsuit, the federal government has decided to reverse course and is now allowing immigrants held at 'Alligator Alcatraz' the ability to petition the immigration court for release from detention \u2014 which the government should never have blocked them from doing in the first place.\"",
      "The federal government has denied that defendants are prevented from meeting with attorneys.",
      "\"Any allegation that illegal aliens at Alligator Alcatraz do not have access to attorneys is FALSE. The facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients. Additionally, Florida established an email address for attorneys to submit requests to speak to the specific illegal aliens,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement",
      "Alligator Alcatraz jurisdiction clarifications",
      "The civil rights attorneys wanted Ruiz to identify an immigration court that has jurisdiction over the detention center so that petitions can be filed for the detainees' bond or release. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades.",
      "At the start of Monday's hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys' constitutional concerns. The judge told the government attorneys that he didn't expect them to change that designation without good reason.",
      "But before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz wanted to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.",
      "The hearing ended without the judge making an immediate ruling. Ruiz suggested that the case against the federal defendants might be appropriate for the southern district because a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miami is responsible for oversight of the detention center under an agreement between the state and federal governments.",
      "But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district.",
      "All parties have agreed that if the complaints against the state are moved to another venue, then the complaints against the federal government should be moved as well.",
      "Second lawsuit seeks halt of operations at Alligator Alcatraz",
      "The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week.",
      "State says claims in lawsuit are false",
      "The state of Florida has disputed claims that Alligator Alcatraz detainees have been unable to meet with their attorneys. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28. The first detainees arrived at the beginning of July.",
      "But the civil rights attorneys said that even if lawyers have been scheduled to meet with their clients at the detention center, it hasn't been in private or confidential, and it is more restrictive than at other immigration detention facilities. They said scheduling delays and an unreasonable advanced notice requirement have hindered their ability to meet with the detainees, thereby violating their constitutional rights.",
      "Civil rights attorneys said officers are going cell-to-cell to pressure detainees into signing voluntary removal orders before they're allowed to consult their attorneys, and some detainees have been deported even though they didn't have final removal orders. Along with the spread of a respiratory infection and rainwater flooding their tents, the circumstances have fueled a feeling of desperation among detainees, the attorneys wrote in a court filing.",

      "The lawsuit focuses on the Office for Victims of Crime, a 42-year-old division of the Justice Department that hands out more than $1 billion per year to all 50 states to compensate crime victims and fund programs like local crisis counseling centers, emergency shelters, domestic abuse hotlines and victim advocacy services.",
      "The Trump-era Justice Department added a new condition to those grants that denies funding to any program that \"violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law.\" That includes failing to \"give access to [Department of Homeland Security] agents, or honor DHS requests.\"",
      "But the states that joined Monday's lawsuit argue that the rule is illegal, since the Reagan-era law that set up the federal government's crime victim grant programs doesn't say anything about immigration enforcement.",
      "\"The challenged conditions would force these States into an untenable position: either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law,\" the states and D.C. argue in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Rhode Island.",
      "Mostly Democratic states joined the suit, including California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. Collectively, they've received more than $500 million a year in crime victim grants since 2021, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The states asked a federal judge to block the new rules and declare them illegal. They said they need \"urgent relief\" since applications for most of the grants are due Wednesday.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "As President Trump seeks to dramatically ramp up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants, his administration has taken aim at so-called sanctuary cities and states, which generally limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.",
      "Within hours of his swearing-in on Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order directing officials to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to identify and pause grants to groups that \"support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.\"",
      "The administration argues that sanctuary cities and states make it harder to enforce immigration laws, especially against criminals who end up in state or local custody.",
      "Supporters of sanctuary laws, however, argue that forcing local law enforcement officers to work with immigration agents makes migrants less likely to cooperate with the police. Monday's lawsuit said the conditions on crime victim grants risk \"destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime.\"",
      "\"The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.",
      "Earlier this year, the Justice Department cut off hundreds of federal grant programs, including money for nonprofits that help victims of hate crimes, sex trafficking and violence against children, according to a list obtained by CBS News. The heads of some nonprofits warned they would need to lay off staff or shutter crime victim hotlines.",
      "At the time, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: \"We are confident that these cuts are consistent with the administration's priorities while at the same time protecting services that tangibly impact victims.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",
      "\"Democrats have eroded faith in our elections with reckless laws, such as unfettered mail-in voting, illegally changing laws to benefit their voters, and slow-walking the counting of votes far past Election Day,\" Fields said.",

    "summary": "Former Attorney General William Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by Congress members as questions surrounding his role in the Epstein investigation persist.",
    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",

      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",

      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. A Federal Reserve spokesperson said they did not have anything to share at the time.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street views it as likely that Mr. Trump's wish for a rate cut will soon be granted, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

      "Hurricane Erin threatened North Carolina with coastal flooding and strong winds as the large storm moved on a projected path up the Atlantic Ocean, officials said Wednesday. The hurricane\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but evacuation orders were issued for parts of the state's\u00a0Outer Banks\u00a0as the East Coast was warned of \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",

      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm Wednesday as it churned over the Atlantic north of the Caribbean. It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded as its strength fluctuated in recent days. It's forecast to retain hurricane strength into the weekend.",
      "As of 11 a.m. EDT Wednesday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was moving north at 13 mph. The storm's center was about 545 miles west-southwest of Bermuda and some 365 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters said some strengthening was possible during the next day or so.",

      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda on Wednesday through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami  said.",
      "Erin was already a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 90 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 265 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. A tropical storm watch was posted for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding that was expected to start Wednesday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly. Conditions are \"expected to deteriorate along the coast of North Carolina by this evening,\" the hurricane center said, adding that people \"are cautioned against swimming at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "The worst conditions are expected late Wednesday through Thursday, when the center of Erin was expected to be at its closest point to the North Carolina coast, according to the National Weather Service office for Newport/Morehead City.

Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",

      "Coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel the effects of Erin with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 10 to over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",

      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have already prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",

    "summary": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said 37 current and former government officials are losing their security clearances.",
    "story": [
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said Tuesday in a memo posted on X that the Trump administration is revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials.",
      "She accused them of having engaged in the \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence\" to advance personal or partisan goals, failing to safeguard classified information, failing to \"adhere to professional analytic tradecraft standards\" and other \"detrimental\" conduct that she did not describe in the memo.",
      "The memo offered no evidence to support the accusations.",
      "Many of the officials who were targeted left the government years ago after serving in both senior national security positions and lower-profile roles out of the public eye.",
      "Sam Vinograd, who was assistant secretary for counterterrorism, threat prevention and law enforcement policy in the Department of Homeland Security, is among the 37 former officials. She is also a national security contributor for CBS News. She has not yet responded to Gabbard's memo.",
      "Some of the officials worked on matters that have long infuriated President Trump, like the intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. And several showed their concerns about Mr. Trump by signing a critical letter in 2019 that was highlighted on social media last month by right-wing provocateur and close Trump ally Laura Loomer.",
      "The action reflects Mr. Trump's ongoing distrust of career intelligence officials whom he perceives as working against his interests. The revocation of clearances is a tactic the administration has used before \u2014 it has revoked the clearances of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several others. Critics say the tactic risks chilling dissenting voices from an intelligence community accustomed to drawing on a range of viewpoints before formulating an assessment. In Mr. Trump's first term, he\u00a0revoked\u00a0former CIA Director John Brennan's clearance.",
      "\"These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,\" Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer whose own clearance has been revoked by the Trump administration, said in a statement.",
      "He called it hypocritical for the administration to \"claim these individuals politicized or weaponized intelligence.\"",
      "Gabbard on Tuesday sought to defend the move, which she said had been directed by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" she wrote on X. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Gabbard and other Trump administration officials have revisited the intelligence community assessment published in 2017 on Russian election interference, including by declassifying a series of years-old documents meant to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its findings.",
      "Multiple government investigations have reached the same conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping fashion, including through a hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails and a social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long resisted the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in his favor, and his Justice Department has authorized a grand jury investigation that could bring fresh scrutiny to Obama-era officials.",
      "Security clearances are important not only for current government workers but also former employees whose private-sector jobs require them to retain access to sensitive information. Stripping clearances from such employees could make it hard for them to do their jobs, though it's unclear how many of the former officials still have or require one.",
      "On his first day of office, Mr. Trump said he would revoke the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a \"Russian information operation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has attempted to revoke the security clearances for lawyers at a number of prominent law firms but was rebuffed by federal judges.",
      "Some of those who were targeted in the latest action were part of Biden's national security team. Many only learned of the Gabbard action from news reports Tuesday, two former government officials who were on the list told the Associated Press. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity as they consider whether to take legal action.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina leaders were preparing the public Wednesday for the anticipated impacts of Hurricane Erin. Emergency officials have warned of the storm's potentially serious impacts along much of the state's Atlantic coast, prompting some evacuation orders that people are being urged to follow.",
      "\"If you've been asked to evacuate, please do so now, before conditions deteriorate and roads become impassable,\" North Carolina Public Safety Director William Ray said at a news conference Wednesday morning. \"Regardless of the track of the center of the storm, dangerous conditions can be felt far from the eye especially with a system as large as Erin.\"",
      "Weather conditions brought on by the storm were expected to peak Wednesday into Thursday, Ray said.",
      "Erin, which is now a Category 2 storm and is the season's first Atlantic hurricane, is expected to stay offshore. But evacuations were ordered on barrier islands along the Carolina coast, and authorities warned the storm could churn up dangerous rip currents from Florida through\u00a0the Mid-Atlantic to the New England coast.",
      "Tropical storm and surge watches have been issued for much of the Outer Banks. Coastal flooding was possible through Thursday.",
      "Holly Andrzejewski hadn't yet welcomed her and her family's first guests to the Atlantic Inn on Hatteras Island when she had to start rescheduling them, as the storm threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds. Andrzejewski and her husband purchased the bed-and-breakfast, known as the oldest inn on the island, less than a week ago. By Monday they had brought in all the outdoor furniture and made sure their daughter and her boyfriend, who are the innkeepers, had generators, extra water and flashlights as they stayed behind to keep an eye on the property.",
      "\"It's just one of those things where you know this is always a possibility and it could happen, and you just make the best out of it. Otherwise you wouldn't live at the beach,\" said Andrzejewski, who will also remain on the island, at her home about a 15 minutes' drive away.",
      "The evacuations on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke came at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean and are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian caused record amounts of damage in Ocracoke. Last year, Hurricane Ernesto stayed offshore but created high surf and swells.",
      "Tommy Hutcherson, who owns the community's only grocery store, said the island has mostly bounced back. He's optimistic this storm won't be as destructive.",
      "\"But you just never know. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,\" he said.",
      "With Hurricane Erin, there are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway. Some routes could be impassable for days.",
      "Tropical storm conditions threaten the coast",
      "Ocean conditions are dangerous off the Outer Banks and the East Coast.",
      "Storm surge warnings, tropical storm warnings and tropical storm watches are in effect along the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines through Thursday. Tropical storm conditions were expected to arrive in parts of the Outer Banks late Wednesday or early Thursday, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. Similar conditions were also possible along the Virginia coast and Bermuda on Thursday and Friday.",
      "Communities in those areas have been warned to brace for potentially powerful winds of up to 45 mph, with higher gusts, and storm surge that could rise between 2 and 4 feet above ground in vulnerable areas, according to the latest forecasts.",
      "\"The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline,\" said Nolan.",
      "In the Outer Banks, forecasters said Erin may bring 1 to 2 inches of rainfall starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing into Thursday. They expect conditions along the coast of North Carolina to deteriorate by Wednesday evening.",
      "Between 60 and 70 swimmers were rescued Monday in the coastal North Carolina town of Wrightsville Beach, which is near Wilmington, according to the town's fire officials. There were no injuries or fatalities recorded.",

    "summary": "Gallup has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Here's what a recent survey found.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer \u2014 \"the lowest by one percentage point in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend,\" the analytics company says.",
      "And a record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol's benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \"one or two drinks a day\" can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup's data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol's risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Additionally, there are other factors contributing to the changing perspectives around alcohol, Willa Bennett, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan and Seventeen, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Wednesday.",
      "\"We know this generation is increasingly out in the world trying to find real community and camaraderie,\" Bennett said. People don't seem to need alcohol to go out anymore, she said.",
      "Other factors include less stigma around not drinking and the prevalence of social media.",
      "\"People do want control of their image,\" Bennett said. \"People don't want to give that up. It's scary. What are the long term risks?\"",
      "Growing skepticism about alcohol's benefits",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that's a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn't include younger people and couldn't prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "\"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States \u2014 greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. \u2014 yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said in a statement in January.",
      "The federal government's current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup's director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans' lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\"Older folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\" Saad said. \"It may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they've grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\"",
      "The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promised big changes. Kennedy has not hinted at how the alcohol recommendations may shift.",
      "Drinking rates fall to decade low",
      "Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol \u2014 a low in Gallup's data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. The previous low was 55%, recorded in 1958.",
      "\"Declines in alcohol consumption do not appear to be caused by people shifting to other mood-altering substances \u2014 in particular, recreational marijuana, which is now legal in about half of U.S. states,\" Gallup said in a news release. \"Although marijuana use is higher today than a decade ago, it has been fairly steady over the past four years and thus doesn't appear to be a factor in people choosing not to drink alcohol.\"",
      "Gallup says it has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Since 2001, it has tracked their views on health implications related to moderate drinking.",
      "Young Americans' alcohol consumption has been trending downward for years, accelerating the overall decline in alcohol consumption. In sharp contrast with Gallup's findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans' reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question's history.",
      "Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren't causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one's health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",
      "Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink said they had consumed alcohol in the prior 24 hours, a record low in the survey. Roughly 4 in 10 said that it had been more than a week since they had poured a drink.",

      "The Trump administration has directed government officials to probe any \"anti-American\" views and activities of immigrants applying for immigration benefits like green cards and work permits, further expanding the grounds that can be cited to deny those applications.",
      "The policy unveiled on Tuesday by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is the latest front in a broader Trump administration effort to restrict access to legal immigration benefits, including by broadening the levels of scrutiny and vetting to which applicants are subjected.",
      "The guidance issued this week directs officials at USCIS to determine whether applicants for certain immigration benefits have \"endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused anti-American views or the views of a terrorist organization or group,\" including on social media. USCIS said those groups could include organizations that espouse or promote antisemitic views and terrorism.",
      "If officials find applicants have any ties to these groups or share their views, the directive instructs the officials to consider that an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" justifying the denial of an application.",
      "The policy will affect requests for immigration benefits that are discretionary, meaning that USCIS can deny them even if applicants meet the qualifications outlined in U.S. law. Those cases include many applications for permanent U.S. residency (also known as a green card), work permits and status changes for foreign students.",
      "While it wasn't immediately clear how expansively USCIS will define \"anti-American\" views and activities, the agency said it would make the determination based on a provision of U.S. immigration law that bans immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens if it is found that they advocate for world communism, totalitarianism, violence against officials or the overthrow of the U.S. government.",
      "The guidance issued Tuesday also orders USCIS officials to probe whether applicants improperly used an immigration policy known as parole to enter the U.S. In the immigration context, parole allows for the arrival of immigrants who are otherwise ineligible to enter the U.S. It was used by the Biden administration on an unprecedented scale, mainly to ease pressure at the U.S.-Mexico border by offering migrants a legal way to enter the country.",
      "USCIS said it would look into whether applicants' parole applications contained \"false or fraudulent\" information.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, USCIS' top spokesperson, said Tuesday's memo underscored that U.S. immigration benefits should not be granted to people who \"despise the country.\"",
      "\"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, expressed concerns about how USCIS would implement its latest guidance, calling the language in it \"very subjective.\"",
      "\"This memo gives USCIS adjudicators even more reasons than before to deny a petition on discretionary grounds,\" Yale-Loehr said.",
      "While President Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration central to his second-term agenda, his administration has also tightened access to the legal immigration system.",
      "Last week, USCIS said it would expand a \"good moral character\" assessment in the U.S. citizenship process. That requirement was historically satisfied when applicants lacked serious criminal histories or disqualifying conduct on their record. But now, officials have been instructed to weigh different positive factors, like applicants' involvement in the community, and negative factors, like repeat traffic infractions, to determine whether someone has good moral character.",
      "The Trump administration also previously announced measures to more aggressively screen those applying for a U.S. immigration status, including by placing a greater emphasis on the social media activity of applicants.",

      "DNA matching 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn and 5-year-old Olivia also was found on the bags, but no other profiles were detected, the sheriff's office said. No other DNA profiles were found on the cable ties, they said.",
      "\"The completion of this DNA analysis provides additional evidence that indicates Travis Decker is the only suspect involved in committing these homicides,\" the news release said.",
      "The bodies of the girls and Decker's truck were found on June 2 near a campground in central Washington. Decker had not returned the girls to their mother on time after a planned visit and was not answering calls, she told police.",

      "Portland, Ore. \u2014 Authorities in Oregon are trying to extinguish a fire burning in one of the world's tallest trees, near the state's southern coast.",
      "The Doerner Fir, a coastal Douglas Fir tree over 325 feet tall and estimated to be over 450 years old, has been burning since Saturday in Coos County in Oregon's Coast Range. An infrared drone flight on Tuesday showed no active flames or smoke at the top of the tree, but it detected heat within a cavity in the tree's trunk some 280 feet up, federal Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Megan Harper said.",
      "CBS Coos Bay, Oregon affiliate KCBY-TV says the tree has a diameter of 11.5 feet. The weather in the vicinity has been trending hotter and drier this week, the station says.",
      "Figuring out how to approach the tree from the side to douse the cavity with water has been a challenge, Harper said. Various options have been discussed, including building scaffolding or climbing adjacent trees for better positioning, or letting it smolder and monitoring to see if it reignites.",
      "Crews remained on-site Tuesday and a helicopter was on standby in case water drops are needed, she added.",
      "The Coos Forest Protective Association said Monday that helicopter bucket drops had reduced fire activity near the top of the tree. It added that sprinklers were placed at the base of the tree, where containment lines were also constructed to prevent further fire spread.",
      "The Coos Bay District issued an emergency closure of public lands for the area surrounding fire suppression activities, KCBY reported.",
      "The fire may impact the tree's standing in global height rankings, Harper said.",
      "\"We've lost about 50 feet of it, just from fire and pieces falling out,\" she said, noting that the 50 feet were lost through the top burning. \"So I don't know where it'll stand after this, but it's still a magnificent tree.\"",
      "Investigators with the Bureau of Land Management have ruled out lightning as a cause of the fire based on weather data, the federal agency said Tuesday evening. It's the only tree on fire in the immediate vicinity, and the fire's cause is still under investigation.",
      "For now, the tree isn't at risk of fully burning down, according to Harper.",
      "\"Right now, that is not a danger,\" she said. \"The tree is so big, it's got so much mass that it would take a while for it to burn all the way through the tree.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Aug 2025 05:00:18 -0400",
    "summary": "As states prepare to implement changes to Medicaid required by President Trump's recent tax-and-spending law, tribal leaders say they are concerned Native American enrollees could lose their coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Jonnell Wieder earned too much money at her job to keep her Medicaid coverage when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended in 2023 and states resumed checking whether people were eligible for the program. But she was reassured by the knowledge that Medicaid would provide postpartum coverage for her and her daughter, Oakleigh McDonald, who was born in July of that year.",
      "Wieder is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana and can access some health services for free through her tribe's health clinics. But funding is limited, so, like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid for herself and Oakleigh.",
      "Months before Oakleigh's first birthday, the date when Wieder's postpartum coverage would come to an end, Wieder completed and returned paperwork to enroll her daughter in Healthy Montana Kids, the state's version of the Children's Health Insurance Program. But her paperwork, caught up in the lengthy delays and processing times for applications, did not go through.",
      "\"As soon as she turned 1, they cut her off completely,\" Wieder said.",
      "It took six months for Wieder to get Oakleigh covered again through Healthy Montana Kids. Before health workers in her tribe stepped in to help her resubmit her application, Wieder repeatedly called the state's health department. She said she would dial the call center when she arrived at her job in the morning and go about her work while waiting on hold, only for the call to be dropped by the end of the day.",
      "\"Never did I talk to anybody,\" she said.",
      "Wieder and Oakleigh's experience is an example of the chaos for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries caused by the process known as the \"unwinding,\" which led to millions of people in the U.S. losing coverage due to paperwork or other procedural issues. Now, tribal health leaders fear their communities will experience more health coverage disruptions when new federal Medicaid work and eligibility requirements are implemented by the start of 2027.",
      "The tax-and-spending law that President Trump signed this summer exempts Native Americans from the new requirement that some people work or do another qualifying activity a minimum number of hours each month to be eligible for Medicaid, as well as from more frequent eligibility checks. But as Wieder and her daughter's experience shows, they are not exempt from getting caught up in procedural disenrollments that could reemerge as states implement the new rules.",
      "\"We also know from the unwinding that that just doesn't always play out necessarily correctly in practice,\" said Joan Alker, who leads Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"There's a lot to worry about.\"",
      "The new law is projected to increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million.",
      "The lessons of the unwinding suggest that \"deep trouble\" lies ahead for Native Americans who rely on Medicaid, according to Alker.",
      "Changes to Medicaid",
      "Mr. Trump's new law changes Medicaid rules to require some recipients ages 19 to 64 to log 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month. It also requires states to recheck those recipients' eligibility every six months, instead of annually. Both of these changes will be effective by the end of next year.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that the law would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade. In addition, more than 4 million people enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to become uninsured if Congress allows pandemic-era enhanced premium tax credits to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Wieder said she was lucky that the tribe covered costs and her daughter's care wasn't interrupted in the six months she didn't have health insurance. Citizens of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. can access some free health services through the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But free care is limited because Congress has historically failed to fully fund the Indian Health Service. Tribal health systems rely heavily on Medicaid to fill that gap. Native Americans are enrolled in Medicaid at higher rates than the White population and have higher rates of chronic illnesses, die more from preventable diseases, and have less access to care.",
      "Medicaid is the largest third-party payer to the Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities and organizations. Accounting for about two-thirds of the outside revenue the Indian Health Service collects, it helps tribal health organizations pay their staff, maintain or expand services, and build infrastructure. Tribal leaders say protecting Medicaid for Indian Country is a responsibility Congress and the federal government must fulfill as part of their trust and treaty obligations to tribes.",
      "Lessons learned during the unwinding",
      "The Trump administration prevented states from disenrolling most Medicaid recipients for the duration of the public health emergency starting in 2020. After those eligibility checks resumed in 2023, nearly 27 million people nationwide were disenrolled from Medicaid during the unwinding, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office published in June. The majority of disenrollments \u2014 about 70% \u2014 occurred for procedural reasons, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "CMS did not require state agencies to collect race and ethnicity data for their reporting during the unwinding, making it difficult to determine how many Native American and Alaska Native enrollees lost coverage.",
      "The lack of data to show how the unwinding affected the population makes it difficult to identify disparities and create policies to address them, said Latoya Hill, senior policy manager with KFF's Racial Equity and Health Policy program. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "The National Council of Urban Indian Health, which advocates on public health issues for Native Americans living in urban parts of the nation, analyzed the Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey and KFF data in an effort to understand how disenrollment affected tribes. The council estimated more than 850,000 Native Americans had lost coverage as of May 2024. About 2.7 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, according to the council.",
      "The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that represents and advocates for federally recognized tribes, has been working with federal Medicaid officials to ensure that state agencies are prepared to implement the exemptions.",
      "\"We learned a lot of lessons about state capacity during the unwinding,\" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.",
      "Nevada health officials say they plan to apply lessons learned during the unwinding and launch a public education campaign on the Medicaid changes in the new federal law. \"A lot of this will depend on anticipated federal guidance regarding the implementation of those new rules,\" said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority.",
      "Staff at the Fallon Tribal Health Center in Nevada have become authorized representatives for some of their patients. This means that tribal citizens' Medicaid paperwork is sent to the health center, allowing staff to notify individuals and help them fill it out.",
      "Davis said the unwinding process showed that Native American enrollees are uniquely vulnerable to procedural disenrollment. The new law's exemption of Native Americans from work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks is the \"bare minimum\" to ensure unnecessary disenrollments are avoided as part of trust and treaty obligations, Davis said.",
      "Eligibility checks are \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\"",
      "The GAO said the process of determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\" in a 2024 report on the unwinding.",
      "\"The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on such a large scale further compounded this complexity,\" the report said.",
      "It highlighted weaknesses across state systems. By April 2024, federal Medicaid officials had found nearly all states were out of compliance with redetermination requirements, according to the GAO. Eligible people lost their coverage, the accountability office said, highlighting the need to improve federal oversight.",
      "In Texas, for example, federal Medicaid officials found that 100,000 eligible people had been disenrolled due to, for example, the state system's failure to process their completed renewal forms or miscalculation of the length of women's postpartum coverage.",
      "Some states were not conducting ex parte renewals, in which a person's Medicaid coverage is automatically renewed based on existing information available to the state. That reduces the chance that paperwork is sent to the wrong address, because the recipient doesn't need to complete or return renewal forms.",
      "But poorly conducted ex parte renewals can lead to procedural disenrollments, too. More than 100,000 people in Nevada were disenrolled by September 2023 through the ex parte process. The state had been conducting the ex parte renewals at the household level, rather than by individual beneficiary, resulting in the disenrollment of still-eligible children because their parents were no longer eligible. Ninety-three percent of disenrollments in the state were for procedural reasons \u2014 the highest in the nation, according to KFF.",
      "Another issue the federal agency identified was that some state agencies were not giving enrollees the opportunity to submit their renewal paperwork through all means available, including mail, phone, online, and in person.",
      "State agencies also identified challenges they faced during the unwinding, including an unprecedented volume of eligibility redeterminations, insufficient staffing and training, and a lack of response from enrollees who may not have been aware of the unwinding.",
      "Native Americans and Alaska Natives have unique challenges in maintaining their coverage.",
      "Communities in rural parts of the nation experience issues with receiving and sending mail. Some Native Americans on reservations may not have street addresses. Others may not have permanent housing or change addresses frequently. In Alaska, mail service is often disrupted by severe weather. Another issue is the lack of reliable internet service on remote reservations.",
      "Tribal health leaders and patient benefit coordinators said some tribal citizens did not receive their redetermination paperwork or struggled to fill it out and send it back to their state Medicaid agency.",
      "The aftermath",
      "Although the unwinding is over, many challenges persist.",
      "Tribal health workers in Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota said some eligible patients who lost Medicaid during the unwinding had still not been reenrolled as of this spring.",
      "\"Even today, we're still in the trenches of getting individuals that had been disenrolled back onto Medicaid,\" said Rachel Arthur, executive director of the Indian Family Health Clinic in Great Falls, Montana, in May.",
      "Arthur said staff at the clinic realized early in the unwinding that their patients were not receiving their redetermination notices in the mail. The clinic is identifying people who fell off Medicaid during the unwinding and helping them fill out applications.",
      "Marlena Farnes, who was a patient benefit coordinator at the Indian Family Health Clinic during the Medicaid unwinding, said she tried for months to help an older patient with a chronic health condition get back on Medicaid. He had completed and returned his paperwork but still received a notice that his coverage had lapsed. After many calls to the state Medicaid office, Farnes said, state officials told her the patient's application had been lost.",
      "Another patient went to the emergency room multiple times while uninsured, Arthur said.",
      "\"I felt like if our patients weren't helped with follow-up, and that advocacy piece, their applications were not being seen,\" Farnes said. She is now the behavioral health director at the clinic.",
      "Montana was one of five states where more than 50% of enrollees lost coverage during the unwinding, according to the GAO. The other states are Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. About 68% of Montanans who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons.",
      "In Oklahoma, eligibility redeterminations remain challenging to process, said Yvonne Myers, a Medicaid and Affordable Care Act consultant for Citizen Potawatomi Nation Health Services. That's causing more frequent coverage lapses, she said.",
      "Myers said she thinks Republican claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" are overstated.",
      "\"I challenge some of them to try to go through an eligibility process,\" Myers said. \"The way they're going about it is making it for more hoops to jump through, which ultimately will cause people to fall off.\"",
      "The unwinding showed that state systems can struggle to respond quickly to changes in Medicaid, leading to preventable erroneous disenrollments. Individuals were often in the dark about their applications and struggled to reach state offices for answers. Tribal leaders and health experts are raising concerns that those issues will continue and worsen as states implement the requirements of the new law.",
      "Georgia, the only state with an active Medicaid work requirement program, has shown that the changes can be difficult for individuals to navigate and costly for a state to implement. More than 100,000 people have applied for Georgia's Pathways program, but only about 8,600 were enrolled as of the end of July.",
      "Alker, of Georgetown, said Congress took the wrong lesson from the unwinding in adding more restrictions and red tape.",
      "\"It will make unwinding pale in comparison in terms of the number of folks that are going to lose coverage,\" Alker said.",

      "\"President Trump has given the Department a historic mandate to restore the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to its original purpose \u2014 supporting public servants who strengthen their communities and serve the public good, not benefiting businesses engaged in illegal activity that harm Americans,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The loan program, which was launched in 2007 under President George W. Bush, is aimed at helping public employees such as teachers and police officers shed student loan debt.",
      "The proposed rule lists some examples of what sorts of activities would be considered illegal, potentially resulting in an organization's workers being excluded from the public service loan program. Those include assessments that an organization is\u00a0aiding and abetting terrorism, violations of immigration laws, and what the rule describes as the \"chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.\"",
      "If an individual with outstanding student loans works for an employer deemed ineligible for the PSLF, the person could still participate in the program but would have to switch to an eligible employer, according to the proposed rule.",
      "President Trump spurred the new rulemaking process in March by issuing an\u00a0executive order\u00a0that directed the Secretary of Education to revise the public service loan forgiveness program. The Education Department is soliciting public comments on the proposed rule until Sept. 17.",

      "Critics of the draft regulation said it would allow Education Department officials to improperly exclude some public servants from loan relief under the federal program. The Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group, said in a July\u00a0blog post\u00a0that the rule would give the Education Department broad authority to restrict funding to groups whose work conflicts with the Trump administration's agenda.",

    "story": [
      "When the FBI fired five veteran agents earlier this month, Director Kash Patel offered no explanation.",
      "Shock at the firings has continued to reverberate through the storied agency. And now, details are emerging about the possible motivation, several sources close to the agents tell CBS News.",
      "\"There is a despicable purge underway of senior FBI officials, all of whom have risen in their careers as nonpartisan, and who have been targeted for vindictive, political purposes,\" said Mark Zaid, a whistleblower attorney who represents a number of federal workers dismissed under President Trump.",
      "Without any public comment from FBI or Justice Department officials, the agents, including, Brian Driscoll, who served for a short time as acting director at the start of the Trump administration, and Steven Jensen, head of the powerful Washington field office, were summarily fired and given little explanation for their removal. None had reached retirement age, meaning the abrupt dismissals will deprive them of their full pensions. One agent's expulsion came a month after his wife died of cancer.",
      "CBS News spoke with multiple sources close to the agents for this story. All of those interviewed spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of retribution.",
      "By outward appearances, former acting FBI director was in good standing",
      "Some of the agents may have been targeted solely because they worked on one or more of the criminal investigations of Mr. Trump, while others who were ousted in an earlier spate of firings worked on the Biden administration's Jan. 6 investigations, sources close to the agents said. But the most senior agent, Driscoll, by outward appearances, was in good standing with Patel.",
      "Driscoll, a highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, began his short stint as acting director with what many agents viewed as a singular act of bravery, resisting calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who had participated in the Jan. 6 investigation. Nevertheless, Patel kept Driscoll on after his Senate confirmation, putting him in a high-profile post as head of the bureau's Critical Incident Response Group, which oversees the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team and its aviation unit.",
      "Jensen, a veteran agent who helped oversee the Jan. 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, was given a significant promotion by Patel to be the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, one of the largest outposts in the country.",
      "One source with knowledge of the matter told CBS News that Patel relied on both agents and particularly admired Driscoll, whom he viewed as a swashbuckling tactical operator. Another said that the FBI director opposed some of the firings. \"I think Kash tried to save these people, honestly,\" the source said.",
      "Yet there are also some indications that both men may have crossed FBI leadership over loyalty and personnel matters.",
      "Some agents suspect political interference",
      "Zaid is part of a team of lawyers preparing to sue the federal government on behalf of some of the fired FBI agents. He told CBS News he suspects outside political interference.",
      "\"If you look at Patel's testimony from his confirmation hearing when he promised the committee there would be no politicization or retribution at the FBI under his leadership,\" Zaid told CBS News, \"you have to conclude that he was either lying or, giving him the benefit of the doubt, that he was directed to take these actions, and that could only come from the White House or the Justice Department.\"",
      "Patel promised senators during that hearing, \"There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI, should I be confirmed as FBI director.\"",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill see the firings as baldly political and damaging to U.S. national security. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that he believes agents should be commended for their ability to enforce the law impartially.",
      "\"When we start purging agents for doing their jobs, instead of toeing a partisan line, we weaken our defense against everything from violent crime to foreign threats, and that makes us all less safe,\" Warner said.",
      "When asked who ordered the termination of the agents, the FBI declined to comment. A White House official deferred to the FBI to discuss bureau personnel matters.",
      "\"The suspendables\"",
      "There are other factors that have led some sources close to the agents and lawyers representing them to question whether the abrupt removals were the result of outside political interference, possibly by the White House.",
      "One question surrounds the role of a small band of right-leaning former agents who clashed with FBI leadership under directors James Comey and Christopher Wray and have been vocal critics of a bureau they believe was \"weaponized\" against them.",
      "Among them is Kyle Seraphin, one of several former FBI agents and whistleblowers who were suspended or had their security clearances revoked for alleged misconduct during the Biden administration. The former agents, including Seraphin, have referred to themselves as \"the suspendables.\" They have been targeting FBI officials they believe to be politically motivated.",
      "Seraphin has been among the most outspoken \u2013 and effective \u2013 members of the group. He has at times been critical of Patel for not aggressively and swiftly cleaning house at the bureau, but he has also had Patel's ear. Sources say he exercises considerable influence from his social media perch on X and his podcast, \"The Kyle Seraphin Show.\"",
      "Seraphin has publicly claimed some of the credit for last week's purge. On August 4, he posted a thread on X under the heading \"VETTING CRISIS CONTINUES,\" in which he identified one of the fired agents, Christopher M. Meyer. Meyer had been serving as one of the pilots of the governmental planes used by Patel until he was notified of his termination.",
      "Seraphin had publicly speculated, correctly it turned out, that Meyer had previously been on a squad based in the Washington Field Office that investigated Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and conducted a search of Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department brought criminal charges against Mr. Trump over the discovery of documents, but a judge eventually dismissed the case.",
      "Seraphin told CBS News in an interview, \"I identified that the person that ran the Mar-a-Lago case that resulted in a search warrant at the president's home was rubbing shoulders in close proximity with the FBI director\" as his pilot. He was concerned that \"this is a person that's now in the kind of buddy space of your FBI director, and he doesn't even know who he's speaking to.\"",
      "On Alex Jones's \"InfoWars\" he said he gave a \"heads up\" to an \"administration insider\" about Meyer. He told CBS News his \"Trump administration insider\" was \"in the president's orbit.\"",
      "How the firings unfolded",
      "On that same day, Patel directed Driscoll to fire Meyer, sources told CBS News. When Driscoll asked on what grounds, he did not get what he considered a satisfactory answer from Patel, according to the source.\u00a0 Without itr, Driscoll refused. Two days later, on Aug. 6, Driscoll was contacted by J. William Rivers, the No. 3 official at the FBI, and told he was being terminated, the source said. He was given no reason why but later received a letter formally notifying him that he was being fired.",
      "Around the same time, Jensen was also relieved of his duties. A source with knowledge of that matter said it was because he, too, refused to fire a subordinate agent in the Washington Field Office, though CBS News was not able to identify the person. Walter Giardina, a WFO agent\u00a0 who was also dismissed in the purge, had worked on a number of cases involving Mr. Trump and other members of his administration, including the prosecution of senior Trump aide Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress.",

      "Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced plans Tuesday for an immigration detention center in a farming area in the state's southwest corner as President Trump's administration\u00a0races to expand\u00a0the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.",
      "Pillen said he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had agreed to use an existing minimum security prison work camp in rural McCook to house people awaiting deportation and being held for other immigration proceedings.",
      "The new facility was dubbed the \"Cornhusker Clink\" last week by Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. It can accommodate 200 people with plans to expand to 300. McCook is about 210 miles west of Lincoln, the state capital.",
      "\"This is about keeping Nebraskans \u2013 and Americans across our country \u2013 safe,\" Pillen said in a statement.",
      "Pillen announced he would order the Nebraska National Guard to provide administrative and logistical support to Nebraska-based immigration agents. About 20 Guard soldiers will be involved.",
      "He also said the Nebraska State Patrol would sign an agreement that enables troopers to help federal immigration agents make arrests.",
      "DHS said in a news release that the agreement with the state to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention space was made possible by Mr. Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0passed by Congress last month. The funding bill included $45 billion for ICE to expand its detention system, and nearly $30 billion for ICE agents and resources.",
      "Jeffreys said the 186 people currently at McCook will be transferred to other state corrections facilities so the camp can be repurposed.",
      "The facility will be run by the state of Nebraska but will be paid for by the federal government. All the people expected to be held there will be low to medium-risk detainees, Jeffreys said.",
      "Jeffreys estimated it will take 45 to 60 days to relocate all the current McCook population while a prison in Lincoln is undergoing repairs from recent storm damage. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly ICE might start sending detainees to McCook.",
      "But Jeffreys said it's already set up to house people, so detainees won't be housed in tents or other temporary quarters. \"That facility has already been accredited. It's ready in the event that we are to move our folks out and move detainees in,\" he said.",
      "\"Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country,\" Noem said in a statement Tuesday. \"If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska's Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.\"",
      "The Nebraska plan has already raised concerns.",
      "In a\u00a0video\u00a0posted to social media, state Sen. Megan Hunt, an independent, blasted a lack of transparency about plans for a detention center, citing her unfulfilled request to the governor and executive branch for emails and other records about the plan.",
      "She urged people to support local immigrant rights groups, and said any response by the Legislature would not come until next year \u2014 and only with enough support from lawmakers.",
      "\"The No. 1 thing we need to do is protect our neighbors, protect the people in our communities who are being targeted by these horrible people, these horrible organizations that are making choices to lock up, detain, disappear our neighbors and families and friends,\" Hunt said.",
      "Six protesters sat in the hallway outside the governor's office Tuesday afternoon making signs that said, \"No Nazi Nebraska\" and \"ICE = Gestapo.\"",
      "Maghie Miller-Jenkins of Lincoln said she doesn't think an ICE detention center is a good idea, adding the state should tackle problems like child hunger and homelessness. \"This state has numerous things they could focus on that would benefit the constituents,\" Miller-Jenkins said.",
      "The Trump administration is adding\u00a0new detention facilities across the country\u00a0to hold the growing number of immigrants it has arrested and accused of being in the country illegally. Older and newer U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers were holding more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.",
      "Other new and planned immigration detention facilities in the U.S. include the\u00a0remote detention center in the Florida Everglades\u00a0known as\u00a0\"Alligator Alcatraz,\"\u00a0which opened last month. It's designed to hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. When Mr. Trump toured it,\u00a0he suggested it could be a model\u00a0for future lockups nationwide.",
      "When federal officials announced the opening of the Florida detention center, they said its focus would be on rounding up individuals with a criminal record \u2014 people that Mr. Trump and border czar Tom Homan have called\u00a0\"the worst of the worst.\"\u00a0However, many people who have been locked up there\u00a0do not have criminal records, CBS News previously reported.",
      "The Florida facility has also been the\u00a0subject of legal challenges\u00a0by attorneys who allege violations of due process there, including the rights of detainees to meet with their attorneys, limited access to immigration courts and poor living conditions. Critics have been trying to stop further construction and operations until it comes into compliance with federal environmental laws.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that his administration is preparing to open a second facility, dubbed \"Deportation Depot,\" at a state prison in north Florida. It's expected to have 1,300 immigration beds, though that capacity could be expanded to 2,000, state officials said.",
      "Also last week, officials in the rural Tennessee town of Mason voted to approve agreements to turn a former prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.",
      "And the Trump administration announced plans earlier this month for a 1,000-bed\u00a0detention center in Indiana\u00a0that would be dubbed \"Speedway Slammer,\" prompting a backlash in the Midwestern state that hosts the Indianapolis 500 auto race.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration \u2014 an idea she said was \"specifically at the request\" of President Trump.",
      "Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.",
      "She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.",
      "\"That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,\" Noem said.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.",
      "Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.",
      "\"The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,\" she said.",
      "She said that in addition to barriers like the one she visited Tuesday, the department is also working on \"water-borne infrastructure.\" Long sections of the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico sit along the Rio Grande River in Texas.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing forward with completing the wall at the same time that the number of people crossing the border illegally has plummeted. In the month of June, just over 6,000 migrants were apprehended along the southern border, a decades-long low \u2014 and a steep dropoff from the Biden administration, when border arrests peaked at upwards of 6,000 per day.",

    "summary": "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Sean Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. gymnastics world was only just recovering from a devastating sexual abuse scandal when a promising young coach moved from Mississippi to Iowa to take a job in 2018 at an elite academy known for training Olympic champions.",
      "Liang \"Chow\" Qiao, the owner of Chow's Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, thought highly enough of his new hire, Sean Gardner, to put him in charge of the club's premier junior event and to coach some of its most promising girls.",
      "But four years later, Gardner was gone from Chow's with little notice.",
      "USA Gymnastics, the organization rocked by the Larry Nassar sex-abuse crisis that led to the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, had been informed by the watchdog group that Gardner was suspended from all contact with gymnasts.",
      "The reason for Gardner's removal wasn't disclosed. But court records obtained exclusively by The Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow's and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Mississippi.",
      "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge. But his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.",
      "In cases like Gardner's, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don't run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.",
      "\"From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,\" said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.",
      "While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as \"a unique and valuable intervention\" when there are concerns of a risk to others.",
      "Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital, two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.",
      "And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.",
      "Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner's former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment.",
      "\"The job that I've always wanted\"",
      "Chow's Gymnastics is best known as the academy where U.S. gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.",
      "Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.",
      "Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.",
      "\"This is the job that I've always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I've been coaching,\" Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. \"And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he's built. It's amazing. It's beautiful.\"",
      "A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow's Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow's.",
      "Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.",
      "\"You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow's as family,\" he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.",
      "Coach accused of sexual misconduct in Iowa, Mississippi",
      "Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow's and his former job at Jump'In Gymnastics in Mississippi to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.",
      "A girl reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used \"inappropriate spotting techniques\" in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.",
      "It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them \"idiots, sluts, and whores.\" She said this behavior began after his hiring in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.",
      "SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 \u2014 four months after the girl's report \u2014 a provisional step it can take in severe cases with \"sufficient evidentiary support\" as investigations proceed.",
      "A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional \"sexual contact and physical abuse,\" including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.",
      "SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.",
      "While SafeSport's suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.",
      "Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.",
      "Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.",
      "\"In this case you have the prestige of this facility,\" he said. \"Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?\"",
      "Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.",
      "A dormant case reopened, and a year later, an arrest",
      "The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow's student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.",
      "The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a \"father figure\" who tried to help her get through her parents' divorce. He told her she could tell him \"anything,\" the affidavit said.",
      "When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname \"Coach Seanie,\" because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.",
      "According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon's affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.",
      "She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.",
      "Reached by the AP, the teen's mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow's because the gym \"had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,\" according to Lyon's affidavit. The gym didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It took 16 months after the teen's 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It's unclear why the case took so long to investigate and also when the FBI, which had to pay $138 million to Nassar's victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.",
      "Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.",
      "They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom.",
      "They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child pornography, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.",
      "Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner's ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym's owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump'In Gymnastics' facility in Purvis, Mississippi, which has since been closed.",
      "SafeSport's power has limits",
      "SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner's ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.",
      "While not commenting about Gardner's case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, \u00a0in an attempt to become more efficient.",
      "\"While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,\" it said, \"law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.\"",
      "USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center's task \"really tough, difficult to navigate.\"",
      "\"I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,\" Leung said. \"I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.\"",
      "A case that lingers, even after the SafeSport ban",
      "As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It's a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.",
      "Asked about Gardner's employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: \"The only information I can provide is that he is no longer\" at the hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.",
      "\"SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,\" said attorney Silvey. \"The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.\"",

      "The frozen shrimp were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati and sold at Walmart stores as Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, the FDA said on Tuesday. The agency noted it has recommended that Walmart recall the product.",

      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",

      "What should you do if you bought the shrimp?",
      "Consumers who bought the shrimp cited in the FDA's notice should throw it away, the agency said.",
      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Aug 2025 11:58:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin threatened North Carolina with coastal flooding and strong winds as the large storm moved on a projected path up the Atlantic Ocean, officials said Wednesday. The hurricane\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but evacuation orders were issued for parts of the state's\u00a0Outer Banks\u00a0as the East Coast was warned of \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "\"No one should be in the ocean,\" North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said during a briefing Wednesday. He added, \"If you are under an evacuation order, take action now before it's too late.\"",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm Wednesday as it churned over the Atlantic north of the Caribbean. It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded as its strength fluctuated in recent days. It's forecast to retain hurricane strength into the weekend.",
      "As of 11 a.m. EDT Wednesday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was moving north at 13 mph. The storm's center was about 545 miles west-southwest of Bermuda and some 365 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters said some strengthening was possible during the next day or so.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda on Wednesday through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami  said.",
      "Erin was already a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 90 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 265 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. A tropical storm watch was posted for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding that was expected to start Wednesday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly. Conditions are \"expected to deteriorate along the coast of North Carolina by this evening,\" the hurricane center said, adding that people \"are cautioned against swimming at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "The worst conditions are expected late Wednesday through Thursday, when the center of Erin was expected to be at its closest point to the North Carolina coast, according to the National Weather Service office for Newport/Morehead City. At that time, forecasters\u00a0warn, severe flooding could reach buildings and roads along the Outer Banks. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding.",
      "Coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel the effects of Erin with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 10 to over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have already prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

    "summary": "President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting\u200b between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after Monday's talks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be the first face-to-face interaction between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "Asked about arranging the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Fox & Friends that he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, saying \"they haven't been exactly best friends.\"",
      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said. Politico first reported that Budapest was under consideration to host the talks.",
      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",
      "Leavitt outlined Mr. Trump's position Tuesday afternoon, saying \"the president has definitely stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.\"",
      "\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to secure a lasting peace and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe,\" she added.",

      "Mr. Trump has said any ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would involve \"some land swapping,\" though it isn't clear exactly what that means.",
      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and controls or claims about 20% of Ukraine's land.",
      "The map below shows those areas, highlighted in red, based on recent\u00a0data from two nonprofit think tanks, the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.",
      "Mr. Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders\u00a0at the White House Monday.",
      "During the talks in the Oval Office on Monday, a map of Ukraine was displayed that showed areas of Ukrainian territory that are currently controlled by Russia or that are contested, with the estimated percentage of Russian control listed for each region, seen below.",
      "One area that Putin is believed to want Ukraine to give up as a condition for peace is the eastern Donbas region, which has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. It is made up of two oblasts, or provinces, called Donetsk and Luhansk.",
      "Residents of this region are largely Russian-speaking and parts of the area have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since a Russian-supported insurgency ramped up in 2014.",
      "At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin recognized the independence of these separatist regions and was accused of using their protection as a pretext for Russia's invasion, making a televised address in which he claimed the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk had appealed to Russia for help.",
      "Despite Russian forces then invading and holding portions of eastern Ukraine, through the course of the war they have failed to capture the region completely.",
      "Zelenskyy has rejected\u00a0surrendering Ukrainian territory to Russia, including in the Donbas region, as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "And Ukraine's leader would not technically be allowed to cede any Ukrainian lands to Russia, as part of ceasefire negotiations or otherwise, because doing so could violate Ukraine's constitution, which specifically\u00a0outlines the territories of Ukraine.",
      "That also means Zelenskyy can't cede the territory of Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014.",
      "Instead, some analysts have suggested that, to achieve a ceasefire agreement, a deal could be struck to essentially freeze the front line \u2014 which snakes roughly 620 miles from northeastern Ukraine to its southern coast on the Black Sea \u2014 without Ukraine officially giving away the land on the other side.",
      "Zelenskyy also has warned that ceding any of Ukraine's territory to Russia could benefit Russia in any future potential aggression toward Ukraine.",
      "Putin has clearly stated that he believes Ukraine is part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically, and Ukraine fears a pause in the fighting without robust security guarantees from the U.S. or European allies would leave the door open for Putin to rebuild Russia's military capabilities and invade again.",
      "\"For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting with Putin. \"If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will invite a third war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as talks continue, Russia has continued its strikes on Ukraine. Ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy on Monday, Russian strikes hit multiple cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, according to local media.",

      "\"Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the Dictionary,\" Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, said in a statement.",
      "There have been a total of 6,212 words added, the dictionary said. A number of them have been linked to celebrities or public officials, and others have been popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha.",

      "Eszterhas agrees that critics have reversed the way they think about \"Basic Instinct\" since it came out 33 years ago, with some calling it a \"post-feminist classic.\"",
      "\"And that it gave women the right to be whatever they wanted to be, not just on a commercial business level, but also on a sexual one,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You know, the days when I grew up in the \u201860s, a woman who was sexually active would immediately be tagged as a slut, a hooker, a nymphomaniac, if you remember that preposterous word, and a guy who did the same thing was a stud and cool and all of that. Well, that, of course, is insanity and women have the same rights that men do.\"",
      "After writing \"Basic Instinct,\"\u00a0Eszterhas said he left California\u2019s beaches for Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "\"I'm very happy to be living in Cleveland and not in Malibu. Naomi [Baka] and I raised four boys in Cleveland,\" he said.",

Well, that was bulls---. But the guy who ran a bar next to where I grew up on the West Side was once asked about me, and he said, \u2018Well, Joey is just a s----a-- refugee kid from the West Side, trying to make his way in the f------ world.'

      "When asked how he would top the famous interrogation scene from the first film, Eszterhas told Fox News Digital: \"You\u2019ll have to see the movie. Go back and see it five or six times, and then we'll have a discussion.\""

      "Schiff was an incredibly vocal lawmaker amid the Russian collusion claims, most notably when the House censured him in 2023 over his promotion that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia.

      "Earlier this year, the Justice Department dismissed federal corruption charges against Adams, so the mayor could potentially work with the Trump administration on its illegal immigration crackdown.",
      "And earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump and Cuomo discussed the mayoral race during a phone call, a conversation that the former governor denies took place.",
      "\"I do understand that [Trump] has a relationship with Andrew Cuomo that spans the years, and he kept Eric Adams from going to jail, so he's communicated with them, which is fine, fine by me,\" Sliwa said.",

      "But he urged the president to \"be Switzerland, be neutral\" when it comes to the New York City mayoral race.",
      "And Sliwa pointed to the nearly two-year-long armed conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"I think the way the president can best help in this campaign is to try to bring peace to the Gaza between Israel and Hamas, because every day the war rages there is a good day for Zohran Mamdani. Because of the videos we see, the photographs, it's having an impact on people here in the city of New York.\"",
      "Sliwa has been recognizable in New York City for decades, due in part to his trademark red beret.",
      "But he's increasingly taken it off in recent months, as he bids a second time for mayor.",

It's in honor of six Guardian Angels killed in the line of duty, three dozen seriously injured over 46 years of volunteer service here and all over the world.",
      "But Sliwa added, \"I do realize amongst the corporate people who make determinations, they feel more comfortable when I take my beret off.\"",

In June, researchers discovered a healthcare data breach that exposed the personal information of around 8 million patients. All of this information was publicly accessible online without any passwords or authentication protocols.",
      "The latest healthcare organization to fall victim to a breach is DaVita, which has put nearly a million people at risk. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita provides dialysis treatment to about 200,000 patients across the U.S. and 13 other countries.",

      "Kidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack (via Comparitech). The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.",
      "DaVita says the incident disrupted internal operations and primarily affected its laboratories. In its latest notice to victims, the company says the cyberattack began March 24, 2025, and continued until April 12. It has not confirmed whether a ransom was paid.",
      "Ransomware gang Interlock claimed responsibility on April 25, posting screenshots of alleged stolen documents and saying it took 1.5TB of DaVita's data. The group lists the company on its public leak site, where it pressures victims by threatening to sell or release stolen files.",

      "DaVita is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't a victim of this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself.",
      "Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

      "1. Collecting and sorting: Filters from traditional and e-cigarettes go through a collection and cleaning process. Ash and residue are removed, leaving behind usable fiber material.",

      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",

      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",
      "Illustration of a traditional roadway surface (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",
      "This technique is still emerging, but interest is growing worldwide. In Bratislava, Slovakia, city officials have already started collecting cigarette butts specifically for road construction. One road built with this recycled asphalt is already in use, setting an example for other cities to follow.",
      "As more pilot projects roll out and awareness spreads, cigarette butts could shift from toxic litter to a valuable resource in sustainable infrastructure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Recycling cigarette butts into asphalt solves two problems at once. It clears toxic waste from public spaces and makes roads that last longer. This approach turns one of the world\u2019s most common pollutants into a valuable construction material. As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

      "Google Gemini app on a mobile device\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gemini summaries can be hacked",
      "Researchers at Mozilla's 0Din have discovered a vulnerability in Google's Gemini for Workspace that allows attackers to inject hidden instructions into email summaries. The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",
      "In a proof of concept, Gemini falsely warned a user that a Gmail password had been compromised and included a fake support phone number. Since Gemini summaries are integrated into Google Workspace, you are more likely to trust the information, making this tactic especially effective.",

      "In a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us, and we've deployed numerous strong defenses to keep users safe, including safeguards to prevent harmful or misleading responses. We are constantly hardening our already robust defenses through red-teaming exercises that train our models to defend against these types of adversarial attacks.\"",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from AI phishing scams",
      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

      "\"One thing that was interesting about this case is the fact that his five attacks were so similar,\" Carole Lieberman, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist, told Fox News Digital. \"They were the same MO, which was approaching the woman from behind, then groping her.\"",

The man reportedly said, \"Good morning, beautiful,\" before sneaking up on the woman, who screamed during the attack and caused the offender to flee the scene.",

      "Jeff Nye, chief of the criminal division at the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Office, was the legal big gun brought in to back up Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson as Kohberger\u2019s defense threw a \"kitchen sink\" strategy at the court \u2013 challenging everything and hoping something would stick.",
      "\"Just pure evil is the way that I would describe him,\" Nye said of Kohberger. \"I think it was surreal, especially going up to Latah County, you know, small courtroom, small town. When I kind of get into my groove, everything else kind of melts away. I forget kind of the external details, but then I go to sit down for my argument and I see him sitting there, and I immediately think about what he did that night and the horrible, horrible acts that he committed against these totally innocent people.\"",

      "One of Nye's key contributions was overcoming the defense's challenges to investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) evidence \u2013 which the FBI used to tip investigators off to Kohberger for the first time in what was revealed to be a controversial move that the defense tried to have precluded from trial.",
      "\"It was critical,\" Nye told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, the stakes could not have been higher in this case on that issue.\"",
      "State police and the independent lab Othram had been working on IGG leads until Dec. 10, 2022, when the FBI stepped in and submitted the crime scene DNA sample to a commercial genetics database designed to help people track their family history. While technically a violation of the bureau's own internal policies and the service's terms of use, the court said the evidence could stand and knocked down Kohberger's arguments that the IGG technique had violated his Fourth Amendment rights.",

      "\"I struggle with the idea that DNA left at a crime scene, that there's any expectation of privacy,\" Idaho Judge Steven Hippler told Kohberger's lawyers in January.",
      "The FBI previously declined to comment on the issue and instead pointed Fox News Digital to Hippler's Feb. 17 order, which found investigators had not violated Kohberger's constitutional rights and allowed the IGG evidence to remain in play.",
      "Nye, who argued in favor of the evidence for the prosecution, revealed to Fox News Digital that it would have been \"devastating\" if Hippler ruled in favor of the defense.",

      "\"It would be devastating, because it wouldn't just be the DNA that goes out, the match at least, to Mr. Kohberger. It would be all of the fruit that came from that match. And that's a lot of things,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"That's all the Cellebrite stuff, because they don't have his devices to review if they never made the identification. That's all of his cellphone records, you know, those warrants were issued based on the identification that was made from the DNA. So all of that's gone. It would have put the state in a very bad position to move forward in this case.\"",

      "If he failed, prosecutors could have lost access to the IGG and any evidence derived from it or from search warrants based on it, he said.",
      "He also had out-of-state decisions that went in the prosecution's favor, but it was the first time the controversy had come up in Idaho. He was nervous \u2013 at least before he stepped in front of the judge.",

      "He dropped a Ka-Bar knife sheath at the crime scene, near Mogen's hip. And his DNA on the snap generated the lead that brought police to the killer in December 2022. Officially called a \"tip\" in IGG terms, the DNA match was confirmed when police swabbed Kohberger's cheek upon his arrest at his parents' house in Pennsylvania.",

      "After years of denying the allegations, Kohberger's defense took a major turn in July. Having failed to have the IGG thrown out or to have the potential death penalty removed ahead of trial, in large part to Nye's work on the case, Kohberger pleaded guilty.",
      "BRYAN KOHBERGER TRADED DEATH PENALTY FOR LIFE SENTENCE THAT COULD STILL END VIOLENTLY BEHIND BARS",
      "\"I wanted to hear him say that, and he finally did,\" Nye said. \"By the time of the sentencing, I had decided myself, I'm done with him. I want nothing else to do with him. I don't care what he's thinking, I do not care what he's doing, and so I made a very conscious effort at the sentencing to not ever look at him, to not pay him any attention, and instead to focus on the victims as they gave their impact statements.\"",

      "After Idaho AG Raul Labrador took office in 2023, he promoted Nye to run the criminal division in part because of his plan to revamp how the department works with county prosecutors, offering them assistance on major cases in an about-face from policy under the prior administration, which would either take full control over cases or avoid getting involved at all.",
      "BRYAN KOHBERGER TOLD CLASS 'VICTIM\u2019S FAMILY SHOULD HAVE A SAY' ON DEATH PENALTY: DOCS",
      "Before the promotion, he said he led the special prosecutions unit and had a ground-level view of what smaller jurisdictions were asking for when they came to the state for help. It made sense, he said, to want to have control over a case, but he also believes that a community's ability to bring killers to justice should not be based on its population and budget.",
      "\"I personally feel pretty strongly that the state should step in in these bigger cases and offer to assist,\" he said. \"And so that's what happened in this case.\"",

His senior deputy, Ashley Jennings, also played a major role, handling a massive discovery process and battling more of Kohberger's pretrial motions. And former U.S. Attorney Joshua D.

      "FIRST ON FOX \u2013 Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-backed aid group that has delivered more than two million boxes containing nearly 125 million meals to Gaza, is unveiling a pilot program enabling families to reserve aid parcels in advance.",
      "The foundation said that as more aid flows into Gaza, families will now be about to use the program to secure their parcels in advance, \"bringing more ease, dignity, and order to the collection process.\" Under the current set-up at distribution sites, the GHF noted that younger, more fit men often outpace women, children, older men and people with disabilities to access aid, which is collected on a first-come, first-served basis.",
      "\"This is real progress,\" GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. \"It both demonstrates that GHF\u2019s model is working and reflects our commitment to adapting to the needs of those we serve and delivering on President Trump\u2019s call for innovation to get more humanitarian aid into the hands of the people who need it most in Gaza.\"",

      "The voluntary new pilot program, designed to provide \"safe, predictable access to GHF\u2019s food aid parcels,\" launched on Sunday in the Saudi Neighborhood with 350 participants and is expected to scale up to full implementation in the coming weeks as the foundation works to develop additional distribution sites.",
      "GHF said the new system, which includes women-only days and lanes and community-based distribution, has long been requested by the community and is modeled on programs used by humanitarian organizations in Gaza and around the world. GHF said the pilot is the latest example of the foundation\u2019s ongoing efforts to \"meet the very dynamic needs on the ground.\"",
      "Under the new system, a trained local worker invites beneficiaries to participate. Those who voluntarily opt into the program will have their photo taken and receive an identification card with their photo and a unique number. GHF said beneficiaries have the option to create a profile online, where they can input information such as household size.",
      "The foundation said a box of aid will be set aside on specific days for each participant, \"eliminating the need to partake in the rush.\"",
      "\"It has always been our plan to offer a way for families to reserve aid in advance and guarantee access, just as other aid organizations do,\" Acree said. \"Until now, however, conditions on the ground have made implementation of such a program impossible. But with more aid flowing into Gaza and GHF\u2019s deliveries helping stabilize food availability, conditions are improving. We are proud to take this step to deliver on the requests of the community and make distributions easier and more reliable for the people we serve.\"",

      "GHF said the new system also enables the foundation to communicate directly with participating households about distribution times, special deliveries and urgent updates, \"allowing the organization to adapt quickly to community needs.\"",

Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Finnish President Alexander Stubb has proved pivotal in the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, taking on new importance after he bonded with President Donald Trump over their mutual love of golf.",
      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",
      "He responded sharply to Russia\u2019s immediate rejection of the idea that those security guarantees would potentially include a NATO presence.",
      "\u201cRussia doesn\u2019t decide on that,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Stubb, whose country joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine the year before, said the leaders agreed Monday that security guarantees for Ukraine were among their top priorities, along with a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting including Zelenskyy, Putin and Trump.",
      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",
      "18 holes and diplomacy",
      "Stubb gained Trump\u2019s ear over a round of golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March, when they competed together in a member-guest tournament at one of Trump\u2019s courses and Trump gifted Stubb a new set of clubs to replace the set Stubb had brought with him.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin. Zelenskyy has also publicly thanked Stubb for helping him build a connection with Trump in the aftermath of Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s infamously heated Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "Stubb also seems to have sensed how to communicate to Trump the extent of Putin\u2019s prospective land grab of Ukraine\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cFor an American audience,\u201d he told NBC News, \u201cthe best way to explain it is that if you take the relative land mass of what Russia wants right now from Ukraine, it would be a little bit like you giving up Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, even Virginia, and then bumping into Maryland.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Wednesday that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook \u201cmust resign, now!!!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comment came after the director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, William Pulte, a sharp critic of the Fed, alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi that Cook \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud.\u201d",
      "In the letter that Pulte called a \u201ccriminal referral,\u201d he said that his agency had obtained her mortgage documents and requested that the Justice Department review the matter.",
      "He further alleged that Cook falsified her \u201cresidence statuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property.\u201d",
      "Pulte\u2019s letter is the latest scrutiny over the mortgages of prominent Democratic figures, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "Speaking on CNBC, FHFA director Pulte said \"it doesn't matter whether you're Fed Governor Cook or Joe Blow on the street, if you commit mortgage fraud, we are going to report it.\"",
      "The letter about Cook\u2019s mortgages ratchets up the administration\u2019s pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Pulte has posted on social media dozens of times calling on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to resign or lower rates, and he attended Trump\u2019s recent tour of the Federal Reserve\u2019s headquarters renovation.",
      "Asked about his fierce criticism of the central bank in the CNBC interview, Pulte said that was a \"separate matter\" but then said that \"Jay Powell has a chance to do the right thing by the law\" with regard to Governor Cook. Powell does not have the authority to remove a governor. Pulte added, \"we'll see\" if Powell knew about Cook's mortgages.",
      "Cook has a permanent vote on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee and was appointed by President Joe Biden to a term running until 2038.",
      "Before joining the Fed, Cook was a professor of economics at Michigan State University. Cook, a graduate of Spelman College and Oxford University, is regarded in the economics field as a trailblazer. She is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve board in the U.S. central bank\u2019s more than 100-year history.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment on Trump's post Wednesday. The Justice Department and FHFA did not immediately respond to requests for comments."

    "summary": "Certain breast cancer tumors may feed on neighboring fat cells, a new study reveals. It helps uncover why being overweight is linked to higher breast cancer risk.",
    "story": [
      "Being overweight or obese has long been linked to a greater risk of developing or dying from breast cancer. New research suggests a reason: Certain breast cancer tumors may feed on neighboring fat cells.",
      "The findings may help scientists find ways to treat triple-negative breast cancer, which is notoriously aggressive and has lower survival rates. Moreover, the results may apply to any cancer that uses fat as an energy source, according to the report, published Wednesday in Nature Communications.",
      "Triple-negative accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers. It tends to be more common in Black women and women under 40 and is more likely to recur than other cancers.",
      "The breast tumor cells appear to gain access to the fat cells\u2019 content by poking a straw-like structure into the fat cells and then dislodging the lipids stored there.",
      "If researchers can find a way to block tumors from tunneling into neighboring fat cells without harming patients, they might have a way to cure the often deadly cancers, said the study\u2019s lead author, Jeremy Williams, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "\u201cAggressive cancer cells can co-opt different nutrient sources to help them grow, including by stimulating fat cells in the breast to release their lipids,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIn the future, new treatments might starve the tumor cells by preventing their access to lipids from neighboring cells.\u201d Lipids are fatty compounds, such as cholesterol, that are used largely for energy storage in the body.",
      "Williams and his colleagues ran multiple experiments, some using tissue from breast cancer patients and others using a mouse model of a breast cancer patient.",
      "In the experiments exclusively using human tissue, the researchers examined fat cells at varying distances from tumor cells. They found that the closer the fat cells were to tumor cells, the more depleted in lipids they were.",
      "When the researchers blocked the tumor cells\u2019 ability to build the straw-like structures, officially known as gap junctions, the tumors stopped growing.",
      "They found a similar result in a mouse model, in which tumor cells from breast cancer patients were tweaked genetically so they lost some of their ability to make gap junctions. When the tissue was implanted in mice, the mice were protected.",
      "\u201cKnocking out a single gene impaired the formation and progression of the tumor,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams and his colleagues started looking at mechanisms to explain an earlier finding from the lab he worked at.",
      "\u201cThese tumors were burning fatty acids as a source of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed an urgent question to answer where the fatty acids were coming from.\u201d",
      "As it turns out, several medications that inhibit gap junction formation are being studied in early-phase clinical trials for other purposes, Williams said.",
      "How cancer 'grows and feeds itself'",
      "Dr. Julia McGuinness, a breast cancer specialist and an associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said it\u2019s the first evidence of a mechanism showing the association between fat and cancer.",
      "It\u2019s also \u201csuggesting one pathway to treat aggressive cancers for which we don\u2019t have any good therapies,\u201d McGuinness said. \u201cWe already know that obese women who have these kinds of cancer have worse outcomes.\u201d",
      "The new research may also suggest that lifestyle modifications that would help women achieve healthy weights might also protect against such cancers, McGuinness said. \u201cSlimming down could be protective,\u201d she said, adding that obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for all breast cancers.",
      "The authors of the study found ways to look at the mechanism linking fat to breast cancer growth in ways that couldn\u2019t be tested in human beings, said Justin Balko, the Ingram professor of cancer research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cThey found a new way cancer grows and feeds itself,\u201d Balko said. \u201cIf some of the same effects are observed in humans, it might be fodder for differences in the way we treat patients.\u201d",
      "But there are caveats, Balko said. \u201cFor example, we don\u2019t know if this is a major mechanism by which breast cancer grows in humans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes a lot of sense.\u201d"

Powell does not have the authority to remove a governor. Pulte added, \"we'll see\" if Powell knew about Cook's mortgages.",
      "Cook has a permanent vote on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee and was appointed by President Joe Biden to a term running until 2038.",
      "Before joining the Fed, Cook was a professor of economics at Michigan State University. Cook, a graduate of Spelman College and Oxford University, is regarded in the economics field as a trailblazer. She is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve board in the U.S. central bank\u2019s more than 100-year history.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment on Trump's post Wednesday. The Justice Department and FHFA did not immediately respond to requests for comments."

      "A tropical storm warning has been issued for North Carolina as Hurricane Erin churns up the east coast of the U.S. as a Category 2 storm.",
      "The National Hurricane Center said Wednesday morning that the storm was about 365 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. A state of emergency has been declared for the entire state as the storm had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was moving north at 13 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. EDT update.",
      "Erin is already a large hurricane, with winds extending outward up to 90 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 265 miles from the center. It is expected to remain a hurricane this week while growing in size as it continues its trek across the Atlantic and eventually turns out to sea.",
      "\"I want to emphasize the importance of taking this storm seriously, because it's a serious storm and conditions can deteriorate quickly,\" North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said at a Wednesday press conference.",
      "The storm is expected to take a turn north-northeast on Wednesday and move over the western Atlantic Ocean between the east coast of the U.S. and Bermuda, before passing south of Atlantic Canada into the weekend, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin will make its closest pass to the U.S. on Thursday, when the onshore winds will be strongest, leading to coastal flood concerns and dangerous rip currents. The heavy rain will remain offshore so that the strong winds will be the most noticeable impact.",
      "North Carolina is anticipating coastal flooding from massive waves, tropical-storm-force winds and tidal and storm surges for much of the state shoreline, especially the Outer Banks, as well as life-threatening rip currents for most of the week, Stein said, adding, \"No one should be in the ocean.\"",
      "Erin could strengthen on Wednesday and Thursday but is expected to begin weakening by Friday, the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Regardless of the track of the center of the storm, dangerous conditions can be felt far from the eye, especially with the system as large as Erin, regardless of her track,\" North Carolina Emergency Management Director Will Ray said Wednesday.",
      "The 11 a.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center said the tropical storm warning now covers north of the border of North Carolina and Virginia to Chincoteague, Virginia.",
      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said on X that he is monitoring the storm\u2019s \"offshore track,\" which is \"bringing dangerous water conditions to Virginia\u2019s coast,\" including \"extremely dangerous rip tides and rough surf, starting tonight,\" Youngkin said.",
      "\"Expect tidal flooding at evening high tide, dangerous surf, and beach erosion through Friday,\" the governor added.",
      "A storm surge warning is in effect from Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, where 2 to 4 feet of storm surge flooding is possible along the coast, according to the hurricane center."

      "President Donald Trump has purchased at least $103 million worth of corporate and municipal bonds since taking office in January, according to new filings from the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "The documents, released late Tuesday night, show that Trump began the bond-buying spree one day after being sworn in on Jan. 20 and include debt sold by companies, local governments and entities that could be directly impacted by his sweeping agenda. All said, Trump made about 690 purchases from Jan. 21 through Aug. 1.",
      "The active trading by a president of the United States is unprecedented and puts Trump in a direct position to benefit \u2014 or lose out \u2014 if any of the entities that own the bonds he\u2019s purchased succeed or fail. It\u2019s also another example of Trump pursuing business endeavors and transactions to increase his wealth while serving in office.",
      "On Jan. 21, Trump purchased a bond belonging to the New York Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. A week later, Trump purchased another handful of bonds over consecutive days. Those bonds belong to various municipal hospital facilities, airports, regional development funds and school districts from Florida to Alaska.",
      "The filings do not provide exact purchase amounts, but instead show a broad dollar range for each transaction. The filings did not show any sales by Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s buying continued at a steady clip for months, including bonds from megabanks Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup worth at least $100,000 each.",
      "Trump\u2019s direct ownership of bonds from three of the nation\u2019s banking giants also comes as he considers an eventual replacement of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and weeks after he nominated one of his top aides, Stephen Miran, to a seat on the Fed\u2019s board. The Fed can directly affect a bank\u2019s profit by lowering or raising interest rates, along with myriad regulatory actions. As a Fed governor, Miran would have a direct say in many of those actions.",
      "The president\u2019s purchases also included at least $500,000 of bonds each from chipmaker Qualcomm, mobile provider T-Mobile USA, Home Depot and UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest private health insurance company.",
      "The filings also show that Trump purchased at least $250,001 of Meta\u2019s bonds. CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the president\u2019s inauguration and made a $1 million donation to that event.",
      "Likewise, Trump\u2019s ownership in hundreds of municipal bonds puts him in line to benefit when those municipal entities pay back the debt and comes at a time when the administration has been tightly controlling the distribution of funds from the federal government to local and regional governments.",
      "Trump\u2019s net worth currently sits around $5.5 billion, according to the Forbes Billionaires List, up  a staggering $3.2 billion since 2024.",
      "Typically a president divests their financial assets before or shortly after entering office, but Trump has rejected that precedent and retained most of his empire since his first term in office."

    "story": [
      "A survey of doctors released Wednesday showed how pervasive medical falsehoods have become \u2014 not only online, but also within the walls of medical exam rooms where doctors and patients talk.",
      "The survey from the Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit research group, found that 61% of doctors said they encountered patients influenced by misinformation or disinformation a moderate amount or a great deal of the time over the past year.",
      "An overwhelming majority of physicians, 86%, said the incidence of such falsehoods among patients had increased over the past five years, a period that includes most of the Covid pandemic, with 50% saying it had increased significantly.",
      "The survey is a rare look into how often doctors encounter pseudoscience in their everyday practice of medicine, and it indicates how their jobs are changing in response to a new information environment in which distorted health claims spread easily online and sometimes have the backing of government authorities.",
      "Dr. Gary Price, president of the Physicians Foundation, said the organization set out to conduct the survey because it knew doctors were frustrated by medical falsehoods and wanted to find out the extent of the problem.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s demoralizing,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cIt cuts to the core of what motivates most physicians, and that\u2019s a desire to help people in the most fundamental of ways. And in a way, it\u2019s a repudiation of all the different things that lead people to practice medicine.\u201d",
      "A majority of doctors in the survey, 57%, said they believed misinformation and disinformation had at least a moderate impact on their ability to provide quality care to patients.",
      "Price, a plastic surgeon, said medical falsehoods are making physicians\u2019 jobs harder or, in some cases, impossible. He said one of his patients decided to cancel an operation during the Covid pandemic because the patient refused to take a Covid test, not believing the virus was dangerous.",
      "\u201cEven though you feel personally responsible for your patient\u2019s health and, in many ways, the system holds you responsible for it, you no longer have any reasonable control over the outcome,\u201d he said. For doctors, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s a setup for burnout.\u201d",
      "False health claims are widespread, especially on the internet, and they affect a wide array of subjects, from vaccines to dietary supplements. The survey did not ask about specific types of misinformation, but its respondents were a cross-section of the profession: primary care physicians and specialists, early-career doctors and more experienced ones, and doctors in urban, suburban and rural areas. The online survey of 1,002 physicians was conducted in May.",
      "The survey arrives when misinformation appears to be on the upswing, both online and in the federal government. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of making false or misleading claims about vaccines and other topics, has continued to attack medical research and worry infectious disease experts with his actions and rhetoric since he took office.",
      "Anti-vaccine myths surged on social media ahead of this month\u2019s shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta. The gunman blamed a Covid vaccine for his mental health issues, including depression, despite no clear evidence showing a link.",
      "Price said Kennedy and others in authority have a duty to be accurate.",
      "\u201cPublic health officials, elected or not, have a fundamental obligation to make sure that the public gets information that\u2019s accurate and that can be trusted and ... to continue to ensure that the entire system can be trusted,\u201d he said.",
      "A representative for Kennedy did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, ahead of the survey\u2019s release.",
      "Dr. Seema Yasmin, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the survey, said the results show the very difficult position that medical professionals are in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too much to expect a physician or nurse practitioner, for example, to address complex, deep-seated beliefs in an eight-to-twelve minute consult,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "\u201cHealthcare workers are on the frontlines, they are hearing pseudoscientific statements day in and day out, and it takes great effort to correct these and to provide accurate information to patients, while maintaining relationships in which patients can share things they\u2019ve heard or that they believe,\u201d she said.",
      "Yasmin, author of \u201cWhat the Fact?,\u201d a book about media literacy and conspiracy theories, said further research could look at how many physicians admit to having fallen for false information themselves.",
      "\u201cSadly, sometimes our colleagues fall for the falsehoods, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be aware of our own vulnerabilities.\u201d",
      "The Physicians Foundation was founded in 2003 with proceeds from a class action settlement, in which doctors sued health insurance companies over billing practices. It provides grants to universities, hospitals and other institutions for medical research and to address physician well-being.",
      "At least one other survey of physicians has shown similar results. In a 2023 survey by the de Beaumont Foundation, a public health organization, 72% of physicians said misinformation had made it harder to treat patients for Covid, and the same share said it had negatively affected outcomes.",
      "Other surveys have shown that misinformation spreads widely among the public. In an April poll, the nonprofit health policy foundation KFF found that 63% of U.S. adults had read about or heard about the false myth that the measles vaccine causes autism.",
      "Price said he would like to see more physicians turn to social media as part of their jobs to counter medical misinformation on the platforms where it often spreads.",
      "\u201cThe medical profession needs to get into that channel of communications, but not just by posting studies there,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to learn how to communicate better in that medium. We\u2019re just way behind. And I think the way I think about it, we need to be just as rigorous about examining the best way to do that as we are at trying to figure out the best ways to do an operation or develop a new medication.\u201d"

      "How to dust properly, according to experts",
      "Yes, there is a right way to dust, although the majority of people dust incorrectly, experts told me. Dusting properly is crucial \u2014 it ensures you\u2019re actually lifting dust off surfaces and removing it from your home. Otherwise, you might just be moving dust around or putting it into the air.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning, consider wearing a face mask so you don\u2019t inhale any of the dust particles that might make their way into the air, says Dr. Shradha Agarwal, an allergist and immunologist at Mount Sinai Health System\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine. Below, experts share tips for effective dusting.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning higher areas, some particles fall onto surfaces beneath them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to dust from top to bottom \u2014 once you get to the lower areas, you can collect the dust that was there in the first place, plus any that made its way down during the cleaning process. Mock also recommends dusting first, then vacuuming. The vacuum can suck up any dirt and debris that got onto the floor while you were dusting.",
      "If you\u2019re dusting horizontally, make sure to clean in one direction (either right to left or left to right) instead of going back and forth. Doing so ensures you don\u2019t dirty already-clean areas, says Mock.",
      "People most often forget to dust hard-to-reach areas in their homes, says Mock. This includes ceiling fans, light fixtures, behind furniture, the tops of door frames and under appliances. Ignoring these spaces allows layers of dust to build up over time, eventually creating dust bunnies, which are small clumps of dust, lint, hair and other debris.",
      "Be sure to clean reusable dusters after every job, or trash used disposable dusters and swap them out for new ones. Even if your duster doesn\u2019t look dirty, it likely has microscopic dust particles on it that you can spread to other surfaces. Start every new clean with a fresh duster to avoid that.",
      "How to reduce dust in your home",
      "If your home is particularly dusty, spend some time identifying the root cause, says Hicks. Doing so can reduce how much and how fast dust builds up, making regular weekly maintenance easier. Here are some steps you can take to reduce dust and dust mites in your home.",
      "Regularly clean fabric and upholstered surfaces: Dust mites usually settle on bedding, upholstered furniture, curtains, drapes and carpeting, not hard surfaces like wood, says Agarwal. Cleaning these surfaces weekly helps remove and kill dust mites, and you can also put dust mite-impermeable covers on mattresses, box springs and pillows, she says. Additionally, try not to add a lot of additional fabric into your home from decor like accent pillows or stuffed animals, for example.Use an air purifier and/or dehumidifiers: Air purifiers with HEPA filters can help remove dust particles and other allergens like pollen, dander and pet hair from the air, while dehumidifiers can reduce condensation in homes. \u201cDust mites have decreased survival and multiplication when humidity is below 50% consistently,\u201d says Agarwal. Also be sure to repair any leaks in your home, as that could also contribute to the buildup of moisture.Keep your air conditioner and furnace filters clean: Furnace and air conditioner filters do an amazing job of preventing outdoor dirt and dust from entering your home, says Hicks. But if they\u2019re dirty, they\u2019re not as effective as they\u2019re designed to be. Be sure to clean or replace these filters on a regular schedule to ensure they\u2019re doing their jobs. Similarly, cleaning your air ducts to maintain healthy indoor air quality is also important, says Hicks. You should swap out the filter on your air purifier periodically, too.Close your windows: Open windows provide fresh air and a nice breeze, but they allow debris from the outdoors to flood inside your home, says Hicks. Dirt and pollen that come inside eventually settle on surfaces, which creates more dust and circulates in the air that you then breathe in.",
      "Regularly clean fabric and upholstered surfaces: Dust mites usually settle on bedding, upholstered furniture, curtains, drapes and carpeting, not hard surfaces like wood, says Agarwal. Cleaning these surfaces weekly helps remove and kill dust mites, and you can also put dust mite-impermeable covers on mattresses, box springs and pillows, she says. Additionally, try not to add a lot of additional fabric into your home from decor like accent pillows or stuffed animals, for example.",
      "Use an air purifier and/or dehumidifiers: Air purifiers with HEPA filters can help remove dust particles and other allergens like pollen, dander and pet hair from the air, while dehumidifiers can reduce condensation in homes. \u201cDust mites have decreased survival and multiplication when humidity is below 50% consistently,\u201d says Agarwal. Also be sure to repair any leaks in your home, as that could also contribute to the buildup of moisture.",
      "Keep your air conditioner and furnace filters clean: Furnace and air conditioner filters do an amazing job of preventing outdoor dirt and dust from entering your home, says Hicks. But if they\u2019re dirty, they\u2019re not as effective as they\u2019re designed to be. Be sure to clean or replace these filters on a regular schedule to ensure they\u2019re doing their jobs. Similarly, cleaning your air ducts to maintain healthy indoor air quality is also important, says Hicks. You should swap out the filter on your air purifier periodically, too.",
      "Close your windows: Open windows provide fresh air and a nice breeze, but they allow debris from the outdoors to flood inside your home, says Hicks. Dirt and pollen that come inside eventually settle on surfaces, which creates more dust and circulates in the air that you then breathe in.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Dust is a collection of particles including skin, fibers, hair, bacteria, soil, pollen and more, says Agarwal. And if you\u2019re in a particularly dusty area, you may experience symptoms like sneezing, coughing, itchy skin, watery eyes and even shortness of breath, she told us. However, feeling irritated by dust is different from having an allergy related to dust.",
      "\u201cWhen speaking in reference to allergies, we worry about dust mites,\u201d says Agarwal. \u201cDust mites are arthropods that are found in the dust of homes located in regions where they are prevalent. They cannot be seen with the naked eye and feed off of organic matter such as skin scales, and bacteria and require moisture for survival.\u201d",
      "Dust mites are not usually found in dry climates, which is why they\u2019re less prevalent in the western U.S. They thrive in warmer, wetter climates, and there are higher concentrations of dust mites in older homes prone to mold, homes with a lot of carpeting and homes that deal with other pests like roaches, according to Agarwal. Dust mite allergies can lead to inflammation inside the nose and asthma or eczema flare-ups, she says. So while dusting is important regardless of where you live, it\u2019s even more crucial if you live in an area where there are dust mites.",
      "You should dust surfaces in your home at least once a week, experts told us. However, dusting frequency depends on factors like the size of your home, the level of foot traffic and activity and the types of surfaces you\u2019ll be cleaning, says Mock. If you have pets, consider increasing the number of times you dust a week, especially during shedding seasons, says Hicks. Pet hair and dander contribute to dust buildup in homes, and more shedding means more dust.",
      "Additionally, if you live in an area where dust mites are prevalent, you should dust more frequently. Mock recommends dusting after home improvement projects or renovations as well, as they tend to create a lot of dust.",

      "There\u2019s one rule when it comes to hot sauce: it\u2019s personal, says Hector Saldivar, the founder and owner of Tia Lupita Foods. Maybe you carry a tiny bottle of one that sets your mouth on fire at all times, or perhaps you exclusively add a few drops of a mild option to scrambled eggs. Whatever your preferences are, hot sauce amps up the flavor and spice level of food, making it a versatile condiment that nearly every cuisine across the world has its own version of, says Julian Plovnick, a chef and culinary specialist at Sur La Table.",
      "To help you navigate the crowded hot sauce market, the NBC Select staff tested over 30 types from brands like Tabasco, Melinda\u2019s, Yellowbird, Truff and Huy Fong Foods.

      "How we tested hot sauces",
      "There are hundreds (yes, literally hundreds) of hot sauces out there, making it impossible for us to test them all. To narrow down which ones our team tried, I first talked to five culinary experts, including chefs and hot sauce manufacturers, about what brands they recommend. Experts also walked me through all the factors that impact a hot sauce\u2019s flavor and heat level, and explained the Scoville Scale (read all about that here). I gathered a list of hot sauce brands the NBC Select team loves, too, and researched smaller businesses gaining popularity online.",
      "I narrowed down my initial testing list of over 50 to about 30 hot sauces to test. We focused on options that are accessible at grocery stores or big retailers online and/or in stores, with a few exceptions for popular small brands. In some cases, brands sent us courtesy samples, but I bought most of the hot sauces at grocery stores in New York City. Once I had all the hot sauces, the NBC Select team spent a day tasting and evaluating them.",
      "The point of hot sauce is to enhance the flavor of food, says Lisa McManus, the executive editor of America\u2019s Test Kitchen Reviews. But what you pair them with can impact their overall flavor, so to make it an even playing field for our test, we poured hot sauces on tortilla chips, which are essentially a blank canvas. The tortilla chips were mainly made of corn, so there was nothing to cut the heat with, giving us the full impact of each sauce\u2019s spice level. This base also gave us ample opportunity to taste the flavor of each hot sauce and ensure that nothing was distracting us from its ingredients.",
      "After trying the hot sauces in-office, testers took their favorite sauces home and used them how they normally would in their day-to-day lives. They provided additional feedback for this phase of testing.",
      "What we considered",
      "During our testing, we evaluated hot sauces based on the criteria below:",
      "Overall spice level: People have different spice tolerances, but to get a general consensus from our team, testers rated heat from 1 (a little kick, nothing crazy) to 5 (offensively hot, mouth on fire, tearing, need milk immediately).Overall flavor: Testers described what ingredients they tasted most and what overall impression it gave, be it bright and fruity, sharp and acidic or warm and herby.Spice to flavor ratio: Was the hot sauce so spicy that testers only got heat and no flavor? Or was there a nice balance of both?Texture and consistency: Was the hot sauce runny, squeezable or somewhere in between? Testers also shared if the sauce was smooth and completely pureed, or if it had some grit to it from small bits of ingredients.Packaging: Testers considered the bottle each hot sauce came in and how easy (or difficult) the packaging made dispensing the condiment on food. Screw-off tops, squeezy bottles, shakers\u2026we saw it all.",

      "The best hot sauces, tested & reviewed",
      "Tabasco Original Red Pepper Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cIn the United States, probably the number one thing that people think of when they think of hot sauce is Tabasco,\u201d says Stephen Chavez, a senior chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education\u2019s Los Angeles campus. It\u2019s considered a Louisiana-style hot sauce, meaning one that has a vinegary base, is fermented and uses medium-hot chilis like tabasco or cayenne peppers, which is where it gets its bright color from. Tabasco is also a pretty salty sauce, says Marcus Shell, the culinary director of Uptown Hospitality Group and the executive chef of By The Way in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "Tabasco\u2019s vinegar-forward flavor is the first thing our testers noted about the hot sauce, in addition to its thin, runny consistency.  It\u2019s a very basic option made with only three ingredients, and you can find it in nearly any grocery store, as well as the pantry section of most big-box retailers. I\u2019ve even seen it in pharmacies and at gas station stores. Tabasco is one of the least intimidating sauces we tried, too \u2014 testers say it didn\u2019t linger in their mouths much. A few drops is plenty to give food a tangy kick, so if you\u2019re looking for something to get your tastebuds used to hot sauce without fear of overwhelming them, Tabasco is ideal.",
      "Franks RedHot Original Hot Sauce",
      "Similar to Tabasco, Frank\u2019s Red Hot is a Louisiana-style variety, but its consistency is a bit thicker, its flavor is less vinegary and its spice level is milder, according to our testers. It\u2019s one of NBC Select intern Andriana Kourkoumelis\u2019 all-time favorites. \u201cAs someone who enjoys a kick to my food, Frank\u2019s is the perfect level of spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis hot sauce has been my favorite since I was a kid and I put it on absolutely everything.\u201d The brand especially recommends adding it to wings, chicken sandwiches and buffalo chicken dip.",
      "Cholula Original Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cCholula was my introduction to hot sauce as a kid, so it\u2019s a hit of nostalgia every time I eat it,\u201d says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely versatile, so I can put it on practically any food, including eggs, avocado toast and pizza. Plus, it\u2019s not too strong, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in pain when I pair it with food.\u201d",
      "Cholula is a Mexican hot sauce made with various spices (although the brand doesn\u2019t specify which ones), giving it a full-bodied flavor with a firm heat index, says Shell. He finds it perfect for tacos, among other foods. I used to never reach for Cholula when it was on the table at restaurants, but after testing it, I\u2019ve begun to. I definitively taste the spices in it, making bland dishes more palatable and flavorful dishes even more nuanced. Like Tabasco, you can find Cholula nearly anywhere, so it also gets bonus points for accessibility.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Jalape\u00f1o Pepper Hot Sauce",
      "We tried Melinda\u2019s entire line of hot sauces during our testing, and out of all the green options, this jalape\u00f1o one won all our testers over. Many of them now plan to keep a bottle at home.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Jalape\u00f1o Pepper Hot Sauce stays on your tongue and in your mouth for a bit after you eat it, says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who has a low heat tolerance. There\u2019s a hint of sweetness to the mild sauce, but you get a kick, too, says Godio. Melinda\u2019s, one of our favorite Latino-owned businesses, describes the flavor as tangy, zesty and zingy, and recommends eating the hot sauce with foods like tacos, tortas, burritos, enchiladas and quesadillas. Our testers only had one complaint about this hot sauce: it comes out of the bottle too slowly because the opening at the top is very narrow.",
      "Pisqueya Medium Heat Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cI remember being sad when this bottle of hot sauce was finally empty,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who brought it home after our first phase of in-office testing. \u201cIt\u2019s lively \u2014 the mix of both jalapenos and habaneros gives it a fun, layered taste that\u2019s good as a hot sauce or cooking ingredient.\u201d",
      "Pisqueya\u2019s Medium Heat Hot Sauce is vibrant, bright, zesty and tangy, according to the women-owned brand. Testers say its heat builds in your mouth for a few seconds after you try it, but it doesn\u2019t stick around for long, making each bite a blank canvas. We also noticed that the garlic in the mixture grounds the acidity and peppers so all the flavors are present and well-balanced. The hot sauce is liquidy, but it\u2019s not watery at all \u2014 it has a thicker, puree-like texture to it.",
      "Truff Original Black Truffle Hot Sauce",
      "Truff\u2019s hot sauce is the only one we tested that\u2019s infused with black truffles, giving it a unique flavor \u2014 nothing we tried was remotely similar, and it was clear that the brand focused on taste, not just spice. \u201cAs a truffle lover, I\u2019m a big fan of Truff\u2019s original flavor \u2014 it\u2019s delicious and it\u2019s not too strong,\u201d says Godio, who has been a Truff customer for years. \u201cI keep my Truff hot sauce stocked at home, and I gift it to nearly all of my friends and family around the holidays.\u201d The brand gets the black truffles for its hot sauce from Northern Italy and its agave nectar from Jalisco, Mexico.",
      "Huy Fong Sriracha",
      "Sriracha is a tangy, slightly sweet and garlicky hot sauce that originated in Vietnam and is made with fresno peppers, which are red jalape\u00f1os, says Chavez. Numerous brands make their own version of it, but Huy Fong Foods\u2019 Sriracha is arguably one of first brands to bottle it up and gain notoriety in the U.S. I consider it a classic, and growing up, there was always a bottle in my family\u2019s fridge.",
      "Beyond the fact that the flavor compliments almost anything I\u2019m eating, I love the squeezy bottle dispenser, which helps me control how much I add to food. I also like the thicker, drizzle-able consistency \u2014 I often mix it into dressings, marinades and dips to add a little heat.",
      "Yellowbird Classic Jalape\u00f1o Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cThis hot sauce isn\u2019t super spicy, but it adds a nice jalapeno flavor to whatever you want,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most put-it-on-everything hot sauce. You can tell from the bottle, which is a plastic squeeze bottle with a screw cap, that it\u2019s basically screaming \u2018drizzle this on whatever you want.\u2019\u201d The hot sauce has a bright red color and a rich, savory flavor, plus it\u2019s on the thicker side, so it sits on top of food nicely rather than immediately getting absorbed into it.",
      "Local Hive Mango Habanero Honey Hot Sauce",
      "Local Hive is primarily a honey brand, but it makes a line of honey-infused hot sauces, all of which we tested. I immediately gravitated toward the Mango Habanero option because I prefer hot sauces that are centered around flavor rather than heat, and this was the only one we tried that had fruit as one of its main ingredients. The hot sauce has a noticeable sweetness from the mango and honey it\u2019s made with, but it\u2019s not overpowering. The sweetness cuts the heat of the habanero peppers just the right amount, although it definitely has a kick, which I primarily feel on my tongue. Because this hot sauce is slightly sweet and citrusy, I add it to foods I\u2019d typically drizzle hot honey on, and I\u2019ve enjoyed it on fish like salmon, shrimp, halibut and sole, as well as burrito bowls.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Original Habanero Extra Hot Sauce",
      "Original Habanero was our team\u2019s favorite red hot sauce from Melinda\u2019s. Rabinowitz took it home after our in-office testing, and it\u2019s the first bottle he emptied. \u201cIt\u2019s classic, versatile, easy to use and easy to enjoy,\u201d he says. \u201cI put it on basically everything and it gave a pleasant, palatable kick that wasn\u2019t too vinegar-heavy, unlike other brands\u2019 options. It\u2019s also got a classic glass bottle with good flow.\u201d The sauce is warm, fruity and citrusy, according to Melinda\u2019s.",
      "High Mesa Chili Co. Roasted Hatch Chile Hot Sauce",
      "High Mesa Chili Co. hot sauces are only available through the brand\u2019s website, so they\u2019re not as easily accessible as most of the other options we tested. But our list of favorites felt incomplete without its Roasted Hatch Hot Sauce, which was an overall crowd-pleaser, even among testers who are typically \u201cafraid\u201d to consume spicy foods, like NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown. \u201cWhen you taste a bite, the chili hits you hard and fast, but then it tones down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe taste also lingers in my mouth, but not so much that I can\u2019t enjoy the rest of my food.\u201d The hot sauce is made with a variant of Hatch chili called Matador, which High Mesa Chili Co. gets from New Mexico.",
      "This hot sauce is one of the thickest we tried \u2014 many testers compared it to salsa. The only flaw we found was in the packaging. Since the hot sauce is thick, we had to shake the bottle to get it out of the narrow opening, and once it started coming out, it was hard to stop.",
      "Experts-recommended hot sauces",
      "In addition to testing hot sauces, I asked experts to share their favorite options. Here are their top picks.",
      "Marie Sharp's Original Hot Habanero Pepper Sauce",
      "\u201cFar and away, my son and I\u2019s favorite hot sauce is Marie Sharp\u2019s,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cThey\u2019ve figured out the right blend of really spicy and vinegary, and their sauces are carrot-based, so the carrot balances out the pepper. If you\u2019re trying to find a hot sauce you haven\u2019t had before, Marie Sharp\u2019s entire line is really good, but especially the habanero.\u201d",
      "Valentina Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cMost people know Mexican hot sauces like Cholula, Tapatio and El Yucateco, which are all really good, but the real ones know that Valentina is the best,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cIt\u2019s not as spicy as the others, but it\u2019s really flavorful.\u201d Shell agrees \u2014 when people ask him for hot sauce recommendations, his sleeper pick is always Valentina.",
      "Red Clay Original Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cRed Clay\u2019s OG Hot Sauce has a subtle but sufficient fresno chili flavor with a smooth, silky texture to pair with its original purpose, which is oysters,\u201d says Shell. \u201cAll their hot sauces are chef-crafted, fresh and feature almost peculiar ingredients for hot sauce. Their products are never cooked \u2014 instead they use salt and vinegar to ferment the chilis and create a naturally emerged product.\u201d In addition to the brand\u2019s original sauce, Shell recommends their Carolina variety, which he says has a similar consistency to Cholula.",
      "How to shop for hot sauce",
      "Before you start shopping for hot sauce, ask yourself what you want it to add to a dish. \u201cAre you looking for heat or are you looking for flavor?,\u201d says Shell. \u201cSome sauces exist just to make you sweat, and some really compliment food.\u201d Once you identify that, you can start thinking through the factors experts outline below to find a hot sauce you like.",
      "While shopping, remember that flavor and heat are subjective, says Saldivar. What\u2019s spicy or delicious to you may not be to someone else, so testing a bunch of options, pairing them with different foods and regulating how much you use (starting with a couple drops before dousing a meal with it) is key.",
      "Hot sauce gets its spice from the peppers it\u2019s made with. Different types vary in their heat level, which we measure using the Scoville Scale. It\u2019s based on peppers\u2019 concentration of capsaicin, a chemical compound that causes a burning sensation when we consume it, says McManus.",
      "Peppers are rated on their heat level in Scoville heat units (SHU) \u2014 the higher the number on the scale, which ranges from 0 to over 2,000,000 SHU, the hotter the sauce, says Shell. For example, the bell pepper is lowest on the Scoville Scale at 0 SHU, which means it\u2019s not spicy, says McManus. On the other hand, Pepper X is highest on the Scoville Scale at about 2.693 SHU, which means it\u2019s \u201cburn your internal organs\u201d level of spicy.",
      "The Scoville Scale establishes what Plovnick says is a \u201cscientific, universal understanding of a breed of pepper\u201d \u2014 in other words, a pepper\u2019s Scoville rating isn\u2019t subjective, so once it\u2019s assigned a heat level, it\u2019s a widely accepted fact. To determine a pepper\u2019s Scoville rating, food labs conduct a formal test. \u201cIt\u2019s done by  diluting an extract of pepper in sugar water until a panel of trained tasters can no longer detect the heat,\u201d says Shell. \u201cThe number of times it\u2019s diluted dictates the measurement.\u201d",
      "Hot sauces, in addition to the peppers they\u2019re made with, can get Scoville ratings, says McManus. But to do so, brands have to hire third-party labs, which many don\u2019t want to pay for. That\u2019s often why you don\u2019t often see a Scoville rating listed on hot sauce bottles, says Chavez. Plus, the average consumer doesn\u2019t know much about the Scoville Scale, so they can\u2019t use SHU as a reference point.",
      "Instead of a Scoville rating, brands may use a scale of fire illustrations or a thermometer to represent spice, while others label them mild, medium or hot. \u201cUltimately, the biggest giveaway is knowing the type of chili a hot sauce is made with,\u201d says Chavez. You can find that listed on the bottle\u2019s ingredient label and look it up to find its SHU rating before comparing it to the SHU rating of other peppers you know you can tolerate.",
      "A hot sauce\u2019s flavor is dictated by the ingredients it\u2019s made with. The core ingredients are usually peppers, vinegar, salt and alliums like garlic, shallot and onion, says Chavez. From there, brands add other vegetables, fruits and spices in varying amounts, which impact a hot sauce\u2019s overall flavor profile and make each type unique. For example, hot sauces made with fruits usually have a sweet or citrusy flavor, and those made with aromatics like spices and herbs can lean floral, says McManus.",
      "Adding vinegar to hot sauce or fermenting its base are both ways to preserve the condiment, making it shelf-stable before it\u2019s opened so you can find it in the pantry aisle, says Plovnick. Each preservation method creates a different flavor profile, too.",
      "To make fermented hot sauces, some of the most popular being Tabasco and Sriracha, brands ferment chilis by putting them in a salt brine solution before blending them with all the other ingredients. Doing so somewhat cuts the pepper\u2019s heat, making fermented hot sauces typically less spicy than vinegar-based varieties. The fermented chilis give hot sauce a complex, layered, umami flavor similar to what you\u2019d expect from other fermented foods like pickles and kimchi, says Plovnick. Fermented hot sauces usually have vinegar in them, but not as much as vinegar-based hot sauces.",
      "Vinegar-based hot sauces, like Cholula, aren\u2019t made with fermented chilis. Instead, they fully rely on vinegar for preservation, says Plovnick. These hot sauces tend to have a bright, sharp, sour and tangy flavor, plus they\u2019re usually spicier than fermented hot sauces.",
      "Not all hot sauces are created equal. Some are thin and runny, some are semi-gritty and paste-like, or thick and pourable, says McManus. Texture and consistency are personal preferences, and often, what you\u2019re putting the hot sauce on guides your picks. For example, I prefer topping a bowl of fried rice with a thick Sriracha drizzle, adding flavor and a picturesque finishing touch, but I like to shake a couple drops of runny Tabasco on chicken wings since it\u2019s thin enough to blend into the sauce they\u2019re coated in.",
      "There are no hard-and-fast rules around which hot sauces you should pair with specific foods \u2014 ultimately, go with whatever you think tastes good. But traditionally, Plovnick recommends pairing vinegar-based hot sauces with fattier, richer foods, like a breakfast plate with scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage. \u201cVinegar-based hot sauces will cut through some of that fat and make it easier to eat it all,\u201d he says. On the other hand, fermented hot sauces tend to best compliment meats, fishes and marinades. \u201cFermented hot sauces have more aromatics so they have more depth of flavor, yet they won\u2019t overpower these foods with vinegar,\u201d says Plovnick.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "A hot sauce\u2019s color is dependent on the color of the pepper it\u2019s made with. \u201cRight off the bat, red tells you it\u2019s going to be fiery hot,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cGreen usually isn\u2019t as spicy, and the color either comes from not as ripened chilis, or peppers like green jalape\u00f1os or serranos.\u201d",
      "Store hot sauce according to the directions printed on the bottle, says Shell. Most hot sauces are cooked prior to being bottled, and those need to be refrigerated once you open them. Hot sauces that are exclusively fermented, however, are typically shelf-stable for up to a year after opening them, although there\u2019s no harm in refrigerating them if you prefer, he says.",
      "If the brand recommends refrigerating its hot sauce once you open it, don\u2019t be worried about the cold environment diluting its flavor or heat, says Chavez. Just take it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before use so it comes to room temperature, letting you taste its full heat and flavor profile.",
      "Yes, hot sauce expires. Most options have an expiration date printed on their packaging, which you should follow. If unopened, hot sauces usually last about two years in a cool, dark place, experts told me.",
      "We\u2019ve all been there: you take a bite of food that\u2019s way too spicy and instantly jump into panic mode because your mouth is on fire. But don\u2019t reach for a glass of water, says Saldivar. The best way to neutralize spice is to drink milk or eat a dairy-based product like yogurt and cheese. He also recommends eating bread, which decreases the burning sensation in your mouth and on your tongue, and squeezing lemon or lime in your mouth, which neutralizes the spice.",
      "Beyond water, you also shouldn\u2019t drink alcohol right after eating something spicy. Alcohol amplifies spice, says Saldivar.",
      "If you\u2019re new to hot sauce, and/or spicy food in general, Saldivar recommends starting with mild varieties and working your way up to hotter options over time. The more you eat hot sauce, the more your body can tolerate it and more you can add to your food. On the other hand, if you stop eating hot sauce (and/or spicy foods) for a prolonged period, your tolerance can reverse, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like training for a marathon, then doing the race and then stopping running,\u201d says Saldivar.",

      "A New York state Department of Health employee who was charged with stalking and harassing family members of the slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has been put on leave from his job.",
      "Shane Daley, 40, was arrested last week and accused of \"sending harassing and threatening voicemail messages to a family member\" of Thompson, according to authorities.",
      "His employer said Tuesday in a statement that Daley was placed on administrative leave.",
      "\"This alleged behavior in no way reflects the Department\u2019s values or mission,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"We condemn hate speech, harassment of victims of a senseless crime and any threats of violence.\"",
      "Daley's attorney, Samuel Breslin, said in an email that his client's \"rights, including the presumption of innocence, are preserved as we continue to review the facts and evidence.\"",
      "Daley is from Galway, New York, about 35 miles northwest of Albany. He was hired at the state's Department of Health in January 2024, according the agency's spokesperson.",
      "Authorities said that Daley made threatening phone calls to Thompson's family members from Dec. 4 to Dec. 7 in the hours just after the late CEO was gunned down on the streets of midtown Manhattan.",
      "\"In a series of voicemail messages, Daley used threatening and harassing language that focused on, among other things, Thompson\u2019s killing, expressed satisfaction over the fact and manner of his death, and stated that the victim and Thompson\u2019s children deserved to meet the same violent end,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement last week.",
      "Daley was released from custody under GPS monitoring, officials said last week. He is also temporarily prohibited from obtaining firearms or consuming alcohol.",
      "Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in December by a masked gunman outside the New York Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan, hours before he was set to speak at UnitedHealth Group\u2019s investor conference.",
      "After a dayslong manhunt for the gunman, authorities arrested  Luigi Mangione, 27, and charged him with state and federal charges in connection with Thompson's murder. Mangione pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He could face the death penalty if convicted of federal charges.",
      "Thompson's killing and Mangione's arrest prompted a national debate about the high costs of healthcare in the United States. A legal defense fund for Mangione has surpassed $1.2 million since he was arrested in December.",
      "On Tuesday, Mangione\u2019s attorneys filed a letter requesting an evidentiary hearing to discuss what they say is prosecutorial misconduct on the part of the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office in their pursuit of Mangione\u2019s medical records.",
      "\"This calculated lack of transparency is concerning, as the files that Aetna produced contained medical diagnoses and statements made by Mr. Mangione to health care providers to receive medical care and treatment,\" one of Mangione's attorneys, Karen Agnifilo, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "Mangione is scheduled to next appear in state court on Sept. 16."

The photographer and crews get each of them positioned on a steel beam, buckled up side by side, and then they rise 10 feet into the air, the full scope of Central Park visible behind them."

      "Grace Van Patten portrays Knox in the eight-episode series, in which Knox is an executive producer alongside her husband, Christopher Robinson, and Monica Lewinsky.",
      "The series starts with Knox\u2019s arrival in Italy, and spans to her eventual return in 2022. Knox, now 38, tells TODAY.com there isn't anything in the series she's apprehensive about or embarrassed for audiences to see.",
      "\"We start it with two young girls go to study abroad in Perugia, Italy, and it's a beautiful experience,\" Knox says. \"They have the whole world ahead of them. That's who I was, and that's who Meredith was.\"",
      "\"And then we have this traumatic thing happened, and only one of us gets to survive the journey,\" she adds. \"And how do I carry her alongside me as I try to make sense of this traumatic thing? I think that was a really important part of our trying to do justice to something that had been a story that has been so misrepresented and so exploited.\"",
      "What has Knox done since she was released from prison in 2011? Keep reading to find out more about Knox's life, including her books, children and involvement in the Innocence Project.",
      "What happened to Amanda Knox in Italy?",
      "Knox was accused of killing her roommate, Meredith Kercher, in 2007 when the pair were studying abroad in Perugia, Italy.",
      "Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty of murder in 2009, though both Knox and Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015.",
      "Rudy Guede, a man whose bloody fingerprints and DNA were found at the crime scene, was convicted of murder in 2007 and was released from prison in 2021 after serving 13 years of his 16-year sentence, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Knox, Sollecito and Guede have all denied any involvement in the British study abroad student\u2019s murder.",
      "What happened when Amanda Knox was released from prison?",
      "Knox served about four years in prison before she was acquitted of Kercher's murder in 2011, an experience she recounted in her memoir, \"Waiting to Be Heard,\" which was published in 2015.",
      "After her release from prison, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle, where she completed her bachelor's degree in creative writing from the University of Washington in 2014, according to Time.",
      "However, Knox's legal troubles didn't end in 2011, when her acquittal was annulled and sent to a lower court for further proceedings, according to NBC News. In 2014, she was convicted again in Kercher's murder, though the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 2015, NBC News reported.",
      "Knox has returned to Italy several times since she was exonerated, including when she traveled back to Perugia to come face to face with the prosecutor in her first trial, Giuliano Mignini.",

      "\u201cIt was bittersweet to go back as we were supposed to go there in such different circumstances, but it was just nice for us to be able to talk about something that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Sollecito told the Mirror.",
      "Knox returned to Italy again and stood in an Italian courtroom once again in an attempt to clear her name in 2024. While her murder conviction had been overturned, a slander conviction still remained on her record from when she says she was coerced by investigators into wrongly accusing bar owner Patrick Lumumba of taking part in Kercher\u2019s murder.",
      "Lumumba was jailed for several weeks before he was released due to a lack of evidence, according to NBC News.",
      "The court reconvicted Knox of slander on June 5, 2024, and Knox wiped away tears in the courtroom.",

      "\u201cI was probably the only person at the party who didn\u2019t really know who she was,\u201d Robinson told People in 2017. \u201cI knew (about) Italy and some legal stuff and something that shouldn\u2019t have happened. But I didn\u2019t really know her story.\u201d",
      "The pair married in 2020 in a space-themed wedding, Knox said in an Instagram post at the time.",

      "Knox told TODAY.com she is an ambassador for the Innocence Network and attends the network's conference every year, which brings together people who work to free the innocent, prevent wrongful conviction and provide post-release support, according to the network's website."

      "In a second trial in Italy in 2011, Knox and Sollecito appealed their initial convictions. They were both acquitted and freed, and Knox returned to the U.S. By that time, she had spent about four years in prison in Italy.",

I thought about what it would be like to live my entire life in prison and to lose everything, to lose what I\u2019ve been able to come back to and rebuild,\u201d she told TODAY in September 2013. \u201cI think about it all the time. It\u2019s so scary. Everything\u2019s at stake.\u201d",

      "Knox spoke to the media in front of her parents\u2019 Seattle home on March 27, 2015, after her exoneration.",
      "However, her legal battles in Italy were not completely over. Even after her murder charges were overturned, the slander conviction she had received for wrongly implicating Lumumba in the killing remained on her record.",
      "In 2024, an Italian court reconvicted Knox of slander and sentenced her to three years in prison. She did not return to jail, however, as the new sentence counted as time already served, NBC News reported.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that while being wrongly convicted of slander, I\u2019m the most slandered person in this whole saga,\u201d Knox wrote on X in January 2025 after an Italian court upheld the slander conviction.",
      "\u201cThe police, prosecutor, media, courts, and the killer Rudy Guede, have all slandered me to no end,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Why was her conviction overturned?",
      "Knox and Sollecito\u2019s convictions were overturned due to \u201cglaring errors\u201d in the investigation of Kercher\u2019s murder, Italy\u2019s highest court said in 2015, according to NBC News.",
      "In a written opinion, the Italian court said no biological evidence of Knox or Sollecito had been found at the scene of the crime, while the third person convicted, Rudy Guede, had left \u201ccopious\u201d biological evidence.",
      "The court also accused police and prosecutors of \u201cstunning weakness\u201d and \u201cinvestigative bouts of amnesia,\u201d and accused authorities of bowing to public pressure to find \u201cone or more guilty parties to offer up to international public opinion.\u201d",
      "In the 2013 retrial, a forensic expert testified that the knife that had allegedly been used in the crime had no traces of Kercher\u2019s DNA on it.",
      "Experts also claimed that a material found on the blade of the knife in question was starch, not blood, according to NBC News.",
      "Forensic experts also testified that investigators may have contaminated pieces of evidence by using the same gloves to handle different items, and failed to properly document and analyze DNA evidence in the aftermath of the crime, NBC News reported.",
      "Where is she now?",
      "Today, Knox is a writer, public speaker and podcast host who advocates for wrongfully incarcerated people. She has opened up about her experiences in two memoirs, 2013\u2019s \u201cWaiting to Be Heard\u201d and 2025\u2019s\u201cFree: My Search for Meaning.\u201d",

      "Knox has also hosted multiple podcasts about wrongful conviction, justice reform, and resilience, including \u201cLabyrinths\u201d and \u201cHard Knox.\u201d",
      "Knox married writer and podcast host Christopher Robinson in 2020.",
      "\u201cChris and I have been married now for as long as I was imprisoned, and together for as long as I was on trial,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post on Feb. 29, 2024, celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary.",
      "\u201cHe has balanced the scales of my life away from injustice and pain and towards love and hope,\u201d she continued. \u201cChoosing him as my person was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d",
      "In October 2021, Knox revealed that she and her husband had welcomed their first child, Eureka Muse Knox-Robinson, months earlier. She said she initially kept her daughter\u2019s birth private because she was \u201cstill nervous about the paparazzi bounty on her head,\u201d she told The New York Times.",
      "Knox and Robinson also welcomed a son, Echo, in September 2023.",
      "In 2019, the couple bought a home on Vashon Island near Seattle. Residents of the small island community were supportive of her and her family, starting a Facebook group called \u201cFriends of Amanda,\u201d Knox told the Mercer Island Reporter in 2022.",

      "In addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated its own streets, with growing numbers of Israelis demanding an end to its offensive in the enclave.",
      "Hundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Ceasefire talks uncertain",
      "Katz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was on Tuesday holding a discussion to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.",
      "The announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off Hamas' agreement to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.",

      "Asked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be \u201cunder immense pressure.\u201d",
      "Asked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said \u201cno\u201d and did not provide further clarification.",

      "New satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel\u2019s advance, with the country\u2019s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave\u2019s south condemned by rights groups.",
      "Imagery captured on August 16 shows sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on August 9.",
      "Mohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again \u2014 just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,\u201d Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel\u2019s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The family was able to live in their home for the past six months \u2014 but in the midst of Israel\u2019s plan to take over Gaza City they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza in an enclave where nowhere is considered safe.",
      "\u201cThere is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,\u201d Abu Sharia said. \u201cMy concern is to save the family\u2019s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.",

      "Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave\u2019s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Among the demonstrators at Sunday\u2019s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body remains in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe Jewish Bible speaks about the Jewish life,\u201d Chen told NBC News. \u201cLife comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.\u201d",
      "The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians\u2019 homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. Demonstrators blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.",
      "The nationwide marches were on the same day as a general strike called by organizations representing relatives of those still in captivity. One of those groups, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a statement that nearly 1 million people had attended rallies nationwide.",
      "In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. Around 250 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7.",
      "Many of the speeches, signs and prepared videos appealed directly to President Donald Trump in English, pleading with him to compel Netanyahu to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with Hamas.",

      "His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a \u201ctoxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.\u201d",
      "Their government\u2019s approach appears to have the backing of Trump. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed,\u201d he wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cPlay to WIN, or don\u2019t play at all!\u201d",
      "While Israeli media reported that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with senior officials on Sunday to finalize the plans for the expanded operations in Gaza, it remains unclear when the country\u2019s military will begin the new offensive in the north of the enclave and in what Netanyahu has called the \u201ccentral camps\u201d of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza, so any armored incursion could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during a war that has killed more than 62,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Two children were among five people who died of malnutrition-related causes, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 263.",
      "The United Nations also warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Much of the aid destined for Gaza has been prevented from entering since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.",

      "Some European leaders maintain that no such meeting should take place before Russia agrees to a ceasefire. Many analysts doubt that Putin will actually agree to meet with Zelenskyy. And even if he does, there's the fraught subject of where to hold the negotiations, given that Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC).",

      "Trump revealed Monday that he called the Russian leader \u201cto begin the arrangements\u201d during his White House meeting with Zelenskyy and a posse of European leaders.",
      "The president doubled down Tuesday, telling \"Fox & Friends\" that he hoped \u201cPutin is going to be good,\u201d adding: \u201cI sort of set it up with Putin and Zelenskyy, and you know, they\u2019re the ones that have to call the shots. We\u2019re 7,000 miles away.\u201d",
      "Trump seemed eager to accelerate the timeline of the mooted talks. \"I think it will be fairly soon,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb told NBC News, adding that he hoped it could happen \"within the next two weeks.\"",

      "\"We stand ready to offer our good services,\" Chancellor Christian Stocker posted on X.",
      "Hungary may also be in play.",
      "Its parliament voted to quit the ICC in April, which could allow Putin to attend without risk of arrest. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has also remained one of the Kremlin's few friends in Europe amid the war, though that may make it less appealing to Kyiv.",
      "The senior administration official said both Trump and Putin have a good relationship with Orb\u00e1n, which could be a factor in finding a site. Trump spoke on the phone with Orb\u00e1n on Tuesday, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "But obstacles remain: Any Putin flight to Switzerland or Hungary risks passing over countries that might not be so forgiving if his plane had to make an emergency landing.",

      "The robotic participants came in all shapes, sizes and structures and competed in 26 different sports events, from running to kickboxing to soccer. The unusual state-backed sports tournament at the National Speed Skating Oval, a Beijing Olympic venue, came as the United States and China race each other to shape the future of AI.",
      "No speed records were being set, and many of the athletes were prone to fizzling and face plants. Some robots broke down unexpectedly while they were competing, while others didn\u2019t complete their tasks as planned. A viral video showed a running robot veering off course and accidentally knocking over a person on the track.",

      "The games didn\u2019t just showcase how far robotics have come and how humanoids might one day be integrated into daily life. They also revealed how heavily China\u2019s government has been backing the development of such technologies, to close the artificial intelligence gap with the United States.",
      "In July, China announced its global action plan for AI just days after the Trump administration released the U.S. version, which experts note is \u201cno coincidence\u201d as the two countries race to win others over to their respective visions for AI governance.

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",
      "\u201cHilariously bad, oddly addictive,\u201d reads one IMDb review of the show, which had more than 485 million views on ReelShort as of Friday.",
      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

      "Ministop, which has more than 1,800 stores across Japan, said it was conducting an \u201cemergency investigation\u201d at all of its stores after discovering that staff at some locations had incorrectly labeled the expiration dates for the rice balls, which are prepared in-store.",
      "Production of handmade rice balls and bento boxes has been suspended since Aug. 9, the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "It said it had so far confirmed that staff at 23 locations nationwide had engaged in \u201csales methods that deviated from our product manufacturing regulation.\u201d",
      "Products that should have been promptly labeled with expiration dates after being prepared in store kitchens \u201cwere left without any labels for a length of time in order to extend the expiration period,\u201d it said, while products already on display \u201cwere relabeled with expiration dates.\u201d",
      "Ministop said it had reported the 23 stores to the health department and that it would \u201ccontinue to conduct inspections, investigate the causes of these incidents and make every effort to prevent a recurrence.\u201d",
      "No customers have reported any related health issues, the company said.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience caused to our customers,\u201d it said.",
      "Onigiri, a staple of Japanese food culture, is typically stuffed with grilled salmon, beef or pickled plum and wrapped in crispy seaweed. It is a popular item in Japan, where convenience stores such as Ministop, known as konbini, are a lifeline for customers seeking fresh to-go meals.",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 At least 75 people, including 17 children, have been killed in Afghanistan in a traffic accident involving a bus carrying migrants who were deported from Iran, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The bus was traveling to the Afghan capital of Kabul from neighboring Iran late Tuesday when it collided with a motorbike and another vehicle in the western province of Herat near the Iranian border, according to senior Afghan government official Ahmadullah Muttaqi.",
      "\u201cThe car was carrying fuel and it caught fire after a head-on collision with the bus, fully loaded with passengers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bus also caught fire and the majority of people on the bus died of burn injuries.\u201d",
      "All 73 Afghan migrants on the bus, 17 of them children, were killed along with two people from the other vehicles. Two others were injured, Muttaqi said.",
      "The migrants are among hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have returned in recent months from Iran and Pakistan, both of which announced a crackdown in October 2023 on people they said were living there illegally.",
      "There are fears that Afghanistan could be further destabilized by the mass expulsions, which have been criticized by international rights groups as well as Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban as a violation of international norms and humanitarian principles. Many of those returning have lived outside Afghanistan for decades and are able to bring only what they can carry.",
      "\u201cThese Afghan refugees were returning home after spending a long time in Iran, but they could not reach their destination as their bus met with a tragic accident,\u201d Muttaqi said.",
      "Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, where decades of war have left roads in disrepair and traffic laws are poorly enforced.",
      "Since the 1970s, millions of people have fled Afghanistan for Iran and Pakistan, especially during the Soviet invasion in 1979 and the Taliban\u2019s return to power in 2021. Afghan migrants in both countries say they have faced systemic discrimination and even violence.",
      "U.N. human rights officials said last week that over 2.2 million people had returned to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan since the start of the year, including more than 1.8 million from Iran and almost 400,000 from Pakistan. Authorities in both countries deny they are targeting Afghans specifically.",
      "Experts say many of the Afghan migrants were either forcibly deported or compelled to return in the face of threats, harassment and intimidation.",
      "Iran had told undocumented Afghans to leave the country by July 6, but departures accelerated amid a 12-day conflict in June between Iran and Israel, during which some Iranians accused Afghan migrants of espionage. The deadline has since been extended to Sept. 6.",
      "The U.N. says the surge in the number of people returning to Afghanistan has created a \u201cmulti-layered human rights crisis\u201d and that some have been tortured and threatened by the Taliban because of their identity or personal history. It says women and girls face an even higher risk of persecution in Afghanistan, where they are denied access to education past the sixth grade.",

    "summary": "European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of unity to end the war with Russia.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Seven European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity. The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",
      "Some met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and other officials that morning. Others made their way to the White House directly from Dulles and other airports. They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The display took place within days of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and ahead of a possible Trump-brokered meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy as Trump casts himself as a potential peace broker.",
      "Inside the Oval Office on Monday, evoking a boardroom scene, Trump sat behind the Resolute desk, military flags at his back, as Zelenskyy and the European delegation faced him, as reflected in a photo shared by the White House. Made of oak timbers taken from a British ship, the desk is a hulking 19th century reminder of goodwill between important allies, a gift from Britain's Queen Victoria to the United States. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

      "Russia may never agree to such a concept and Trump may yet change his mind, but for the moment, they were satisfied with the day\u2019s conversations, the source said.",

      "Changing outfits \u2014 and mood",
      "That optimism was thanks at least in part to the tone set by the Ukrainian leader's arrival in a blazer-style jacket and collared shirt, a departure from his trademark military garb.",
      "A fixation on attire might seem trivial given the stakes as the world leaders gathered to discuss ending the brutal conflict, but style mattered here.",
      "For Europe\u2019s leaders, the meeting was about optics as much as substance: A chance to undo any ground Russian President Vladimir Putin may have gained with Trump in Alaska last week.",

      "Zelenskyy had clearly adjusted his approach to diplomacy beyond his outfit, opening with a flurry of 11 \u201cthank yous\u201d in four and a half minutes, a striking contrast with February when he was branded ungrateful.",
      "The Ukrainian leader forged family ties, handing his host a letter from Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to American first lady Melania Trump. Zelenskyy also presented Trump with a golf club, a gift passed on to him by a wounded Ukrainian soldier.",
      "\"You look fabulous in that suit,\" said the reporter who took Zelenskyy to task about his outfit in February.",
      "Zelenskyy himself didn\u2019t leave empty handed. Trump handed him \u201csymbolic keys to the White House,\u201d the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said in a statement Tuesday.",

      "\u201cI really want to thank you for your leadership,\u201d opined NATO chief Mark Rutte.",
      "The substance of the talks remains murky, but Trump refrained from blaming Europe and appeared to enjoy the onslaught of flattery while even offering some in return.",

      "In his own apparent attempt at flattery, Medvedev opined that Europe\u2019s leaders had \u201cfailed to outplay\u201d Trump.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for a Ukrainian president and Ukrainian officials to have talks about peace as their country is being destroyed and as their civilians are being killed,\u201d he said.",
      "Putin kept up the pressure in the lead-up to the talks with deadly attacks in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia overnight, seemingly trying to push Zelenskyy to meet what are thought to be sweeping demands for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine.",
      "Macron said there should not be any land swapping, as Trump has suggested, particularly because there have been long periods during the Russian-started war that its military was not able make significant gains in taking control of Ukrainian land.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that in a bid to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, he plans to set up a direct meeting between the two countries' leaders, followed by a trilateral meeting in which he would take part.",
      "Trump revealed the next steps in his attempt to broker a peace deal on Truth Social after a full afternoon of meetings at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who are eager to see Ukraine safeguarded from future Russian aggression.",
      "When the talks ended, Trump wrote, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the arrangements. He spoke to Putin for about 40 minutes in the Oval Office without the European leaders present.",
      "\"Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Trump's report comes amid a rapid-fire effort on his part to end a conflict that began more than three years ago with Russia's invasion of its smaller democratic neighbor.",
      "He flew to Alaska on Friday for a face-to-face meeting with Putin and then hastened to invite Zelenskyy and the European leaders to the White House on Monday to make more progress.",
      "The gathering that Trump hosted was an extraordinary spectacle in its own right, carrying echoes of the Second World War. On one day, under one roof, Western leaders assembled in hopes of ending a conflict between a vulnerable European democracy and a bigger dictatorship bent on gobbling up more territory.",
      "Trump met with Zelenskyy at the White House for about an hour in an accelerated effort to end the war on terms acceptable to both sides. The pair then met with European leaders to work toward a breakthrough in a conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if it were allowed to persist.",
      "Trump greeted Zelenskyy in the early afternoon with a smile and a warm handshake \u2014 a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump took note of Zelenskyy's more decorous look. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.",
      "\"The best I had,\" Zelenskyy told him.",
      "\"I love it!\" Trump said.",
      "Fresh off his summit with Putin, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. \u201cWe had a very good conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the best one.\u201d",
      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "When a reporter asked whether he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",
      "\"We need to stop this war,\" he said. \"To stop Russia, we need support from American and from European partners.\"",
      "Upon finishing the meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy went straight to another meeting with the European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d he told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" he replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to jump-start peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different stance. He wrote late Sunday on X that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying, \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d"

      "For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots.",
      "For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force.",
      "Its fate may now be decided in the Oval Office rather than on the battlefield.",
      "What is the Donbas?",
      "Made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Donbas is an industrial powerhouse spanning roughly 20,000 square miles, making it roughly the size of West Virginia. It is rich in coal and metal deposits, and shaped by industrial towns and strategically important ports on the Sea of Azov.",
      "After Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations.",
