      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Strouse died at his home in New York City, his family said through the publicity agency The Press Room.",
      "In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Strouse wrote more than a dozen Broadway musicals, as well as film scores and the song \"Those Were the Days,\" the theme song for the sitcom \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Strouse turned out such popular \u2014 and catchy \u2014 show tunes as \"Tomorrow,\" the optimistic anthem from \"Annie,\" and the equally cheerful \"Put on a Happy Face\" from \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" his first Broadway success.",

      "Bono has a seaside villa that\u2019s a short trip away from Cannes",
      "CANNES, France -- Cannes is a short trip from Bono\u2019s seaside villa in Eze-sur-Mer. He bought it with The Edge in 1993, and considers himself grateful to a coastline that, he says, gave him a \u201cdelayed adolescence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you I\u2019ve slept on beaches close to here,\u201d Bono says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up in the sun.\u201d",
      "But that doesn't mean the Cannes Film Festival is a particularly familiar experience for the U2 frontman. He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

The tour comes on the heels of performing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl and \u201cBeethoven Blues,\u201d which reimagined the famed German pianist\u2019s work and debuted No. 1 on Billboard's classical albums chart.",

So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",

      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "South Korean artist BIBI has released her sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE,\u201d blending genre-defying sounds with philosophical themes",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean artist BIBI released her highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d on Wednesday, delivering a project that blends her signature genre-defying sound with philosophical twists.",
      "The singer, songwriter and actor, who moves fluidly between pop, R&B, hip-hop and electronic music, has built a reputation for her bold, unapologetic presence in an industry often defined by careful image management. Her latest album features 14 tracks, including six new songs alongside previously released hits like \u201cBam Yang Gang\u201d and \u201cDerre.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, BIBI explained the meaning behind the album\u2019s lead single \u201cApocalypse,\u201d which carries a more poetic Korean title meaning \u201cThe Apple Tree of the End Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought, if there was the fruit of knowledge of good and evil at the beginning, then this would be the apple tree at the end of times,\u201d BIBI said.",
      "\u201cYou know that saying \u2014 when asked what you\u2019d do if the world ended tomorrow, some say they\u2019d plant an apple tree, others say they\u2019d have an orgy. ... But to me, they felt like the same thing. Both are, in essence, acts of planting seeds.\u201d",
      "Her interpretation, merging ideas of creation, pleasure, and existential finality, may come across as provocative in a conservative South Korean society where open discussions about sex remain rare and often taboo.",
      "\u201cIn reality, everything has an end, and what each person chooses to do in that moment is their own,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be labeled as good or bad. After all, isn\u2019t the very idea of good and evil ambiguous?\u201d",
      "One of Korea\u2019s fastest-rising stars with a growing international presence, BIBI reflected on the surprising success of \u201cBam Yang Gang.\u201d The song, which means a chestnut jelly snack in Korean, became a viral sensation in South Korea last year while she was too busy to notice.",
      "\u201cI was filming two dramas simultaneously, so I was really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really feel it at that time. Actually, I felt it more this year because people introduce me saying, \u2018Last year was the year of Bam Yang Gang.\u2018\u201d",
      "Despite her growing popularity, BIBI aspires to maintain an element of \u201cambiguity\u201d in her artistry.",
      "\u201cI want to be a mysterious artist. Like \u2018Gacha!\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling. Like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get from a Gacha machine,\u201d she explained, referencing the Japanese toy vending machines known for their randomized collectibles.",
      "The album includes \u201cPygma girl,\u201d a track that reimagines the Greek myth of Pygmalion by reversing traditional muse-artist dynamics, suggesting the subject is the art itself rather than merely inspiring the creator.",
      "\u201cMidnight Cruise,\u201d another standout track, was written after she dreamt about her late grandfather before her Coachella performance in 2024.",
      "BIBI will kick off her first global tour in Seoul on May 16, before heading to the United States and Canada. She will then continue across Asia, with stops including Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The tour will conclude in Australia and New Zealand this October.",

      "One would think the job of making the NFL schedule has got somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture",
      "NBC Sports president Rick Cordella put it best when summarizing what the NFL's scheduling department goes through each year.",
      "\u201cI have five kids at home and you never satisfy them all. Just try and do your best, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d Cordella said Wednesday afternoon after he had a chance to look at the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d slate for the upcoming season. \u201cThey have really, really hard jobs. I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",
      "\u201cI tend to hear the expression that, \u2018I haven\u2019t gone in the water since \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",
      "If \u201cJaws\u201d were made today, he doesn't think it'd have the same effect. But in the 1970s, \u201cit was just perfect in terms of generating this level of fear to a public that was largely uneducated about sharks, because we were uneducated. Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- An alligator that appeared in numerous TV shows and films over three decades, most notably the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d has died at a gator farm in southern Colorado.",
      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",
      "But his most famous role was in \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d a film about a failed and ill-tempered hockey player who discovers a talent for golf. The title character played by Sandler confronts Morris after hitting a golf ball that ends up in the gator's mouth.",
      "Sandler posted a tribute to Morris on Instagram on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers \u2014 really anyone with arms or legs \u2014 but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film,\" Sandler wrote. \"The day you wouldn\u2019t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris' body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\" the farm posted on Facebook on Monday.",

      "A former model has reproached one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model reproached one of Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies.",
      "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Kaja Sokola retorted. In her fifth and final day of testimony at Weinstein's sex crimes retrial, she maintained that she was telling the truth and that Weinstein's alleged conduct in her teens had changed the course of her life.",
      "\u201cIt changed the course of your life in that you got $3.5 million from false accusations?\u201d defense lawyer Mike Cibella pressed, referring to compensation she was awarded through civil proceedings in recent years.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s very unfair,\" Sokola said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "During her days on the witness stand, she said Weinstein repeatedly offered to foster her acting ambitions but then made unwanted physical advances, beginning when she was 16 in 2002.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces a sexual assault charge related solely to her allegation that he forced oral sex on her when she was 19. He also faces charges based on two other women's claims. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and his attorneys assert that his accusers had consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer because they wanted movie and TV work.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers grilled Sokola about her requests for career help from him after the alleged assault, her motives for her civil lawsuits and criminal trial testimony, as well as her personal struggles, and even a private journal she kept for an alcohol-abuse program in her native Poland.",
      "After apparently getting the decade-old writings via the witness' sister, the defense was allowed to bring up portions in which Sokola said two other men had sexually assaulted her over the years but didn't say the same about Weinstein. Instead, she wrote that he promised her help but didn't deliver.",
      "Sokola testified Wednesday that she had left out Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse partly because she couldn't come to terms with it at the time. Also, she said, her sponsor was in the film business in Poland and knew who Weinstein was.",
      "Cibella questioned that explanation, noting that the text mentioned only \u201cHarvey W\u201d and nothing about his profession. Sokola said her sponsor nonetheless knew his identity because they talked about it.",
      "Tearing up as she spoke, she said she hadn\u2019t seen the black notebook for 10 years, never gave anyone permission to share it and was stunned and appalled to be confronted with it in court.",
      "\u201cI felt very violated,\u201d said Sokola, now 39 and a psychotherapist.",
      "She was the second of Weinstein's accusers to testify at the retrial, and the only one who wasn't involved in his first trial in 2020. That proceeding led to a landmark #MeToo-era conviction that was subsequently overturned, setting up the retrial. Prosecutors decided to add Sokola's allegations to it.",
      "Another woman, Miriam Haley, already has told jurors at the retrial that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify in the coming days or weeks. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission to be identified. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The 1989 shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in Los Angeles gripped the nation.",
      "The killings of the entertainment executive and his wife in their wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood were brutal. Their son Lyle Menendez was the one who called 911, with the brothers initially claiming the killing was Mafia-related or connected to their father\u2019s business dealings.",
      "Lyle Menendez was attending Princeton University, and his younger brother Erik Menendez was a tennis star.",
      "The brothers were later arrested, charged and convicted for their parents\u2019 deaths.",
      "The brothers have argued that they committed the crimes in self-defense after years of abuse by their father.",
      "On Tuesday, the brothers were granted their first chance at freedom in decades. A Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers\u2019 sentences from life in prison without parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Coming on the heels of the O.J. Simpson trial, the nation was hungry for true crime TV. The brothers\u2019 first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. It spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations.",
      "The Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u201d and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers,\u201d released in the fall of 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the case.",
      "The brothers\u2019 lawyers turned to family members and those who knew the brothers since their conviction to speak to their character and rehabilitation in prison in front of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic.",
      "The Menendez family have supported the brothers and called for their release since their resentencing effort began last fall.",
      "Prosecutors, who have opposed the brothers\u2019 resentencing, did not call any witnesses. They\u2019ve argued the brothers haven\u2019t taken full responsibility for their crimes.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez appeared virtually to read their statements to the court.",
      "\u201cYou did not deserve what I did to you, but you inspire me to do better,\u201d Erik Menendez said, addressing his family.",
      "Jesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, granting them a new sentence of 50 years to life.",
      "The brothers are immediately eligible for parole under California\u2019s youthful offender law because they committed the crime at ages 18 and 21, both under the age of 26.",
      "Parole suitability hearings are conducted by a state board to determine if a person should be released. An inmate will be scheduled for their first hearing no later than six months following their eligibility date, according to board policy.",
      "They already have a hearing before the board scheduled for June 13 in a clemency petition they\u2019ve submitted to Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will serve as their formal parole hearing or if a separate one will be scheduled.",
      "Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for him to determine their danger to the public if released.",
      "Anne Bremner, a trial lawyer in Seattle, said the brothers will have some pressure on them to prepare for the parole board and impress upon them that they should be let out.",
      "\u201cMy guess is the parole board has been watching this and of course they\u2019ve done these risk assessments already,\u201d she said. They know \u201cwho these two are, what their alleged crimes were and what they\u2019ve done since the time that they were incarcerated until today.\u201d",
      "If they are denied at their first parole hearing, they will continue to receive subsequent hearings until they are granted release.",
      "If parole is granted, Newsom could still move to override the board. If he lets the parole decision stand, the brothers would be released from prison.",
      "In May 2023, the brothers\u2019 attorneys also filed a petition for habeas corpus to the court, asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their sexual abuse. LA prosecutors have filed a motion opposing that petition, but its status is unclear.",

      "Lanez was in fair condition a day after the attack in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, where he\u2019s serving a 10-year sentence for shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, Pedro Calderon Michel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email.",

      "On the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d one of Chaplin\u2019s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival\u2019s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes\u2019 Debussy Theatre.",
      "Years in the making, this \u201cGold Rush\u201d pristinely restores Chaplin\u2019s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.",
      "The restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.",
      "In \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d Chaplin's lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film's deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp's humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.",
      "The film's premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.",
      "\u201cWhat to say about \u2018The Gold Rush?' said Spencer Chaplin. \u201cIt was his biggest production to date. He built the set \u2014 it was almost like a tourist attraction in L.A. at the time. He built the mountains.\u201d",
      "The screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes' largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.",
      "\u201cOur grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,\u201d said Kiera Chaplin.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former teen fashion model testifying in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges was confronted on the stand Tuesday with a private journal where defense attorneys say she wrote about people who sexually abused her.",
      "As one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers began to question her about the handwritten journal, Kaja Sokola protested that it shouldn\u2019t be discussed in open court as she\u2019d written it as part of a substance abuse treatment program years ago.",
      "\u201cThis is very inappropriate,\u201d she pleaded as the attorney began to cite portions of the text, which they say was originally written in Polish in 2015. \u201cPlease don\u2019t read that. This is my personal things. I\u2019m not on trial here.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber dismissed the jury for a lunch break as Sokola began to get emotional.",

      "Michael Cibella, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, told Farber that the defense team intends to question Sokola on a part of the journal where she describes at least five sexual assaults she\u2019s suffered over her life.",
      "Weinstein, they say, is not among those she named, though he does appear elsewhere in the journal. They say she references her frustration and disappointment after a \u201cHarvey W\u201d had led her along, \u201cpromising me help\u201d but \u201cnothing came out of it.\u201d",
      "Sokola testified last week that Weinstein exploited her dreams of an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was a 16-year-old on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Some of those allegations are beyond the legal time limit for criminal charges, but Weinstein faces a criminal sex act charge over Sokola\u2019s claim that he forced oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors added the charge to the landmark #MeToo case last year, after an appeals court overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction. The guilty verdict pertained to allegations from two other women, who also have testified or are expected to testify at the retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers, in their cross-examination of Sokola that began Friday, have sought to raise doubts about her allegations, portraying her as a wannabe actor who tried to leverage her consensual relations with the former studio boss.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola has given her permission to be identified.",

      "A Gustav Mahler festival featuring all his symphonies and other major works is taking place at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam through May 18",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 climbed the Concertgebouw podium and turned to the audience at the orchestra\u2019s third Gustav Mahler Festival in 105 years, the conductor could see the writing on the wall.",
      "Facing him was \u201cMAHLER\u201d etched in gold on a cartouche and shining in a spotlight, centered in a permanent position of honor among the 17 composers enshrined across the balcony front. And sitting in the first row directly behind the sign Friday night was Marina Mahler, the composer\u2019s 81-year-old granddaughter.",
      "\u201cIt was just as it should be. I was terribly moved and excited at the same time,\u201d she said after the final note of Symphony No. 1. \u201cIt affected me in the deepest possible way.\u201d",
      "All 10 of Mahler's numbered symphonies are being presented in order along with his other major works from May 8-18, ending on the 114th anniversary of his death at age 50.",
      "\u201cThis is in a way the first orchestra that really trusted in Mahler,\u201d M\u00e4kela said.",
      "Joining the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra are the Budapest Festival Orchestra, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic, with conducting split among M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Symphonies 1 and 8), Iv\u00e1n Fischer (2 and 5), Fabio Luisi (3 and 4), Jaap van Zweden (6 and 7), Kirill Petrenko (9) and Sakari Oramo (10). Programs are simulcast to a 1,500-seat amphitheater in Amsterdam's Vondelpark.",
      "\u201cWe have a U.S. orchestra for the first time in this festival,\u201d said Simon Reinink, who headed the planning as general director of The Concertgebouw (the building, as opposed to the orchestra). \u201cWe also thought why shouldn\u2019t we invite an Asian orchestra?\u201d",
      "Mahler's first champion was Willem Mengelberg, who conducted the entirety of the first Mahler Festival in 1920 to celebrate his 25th anniversary as the Concertgebouw's chief conductor. A second festival was held in 1995 to mark the 75th anniversary of the first festival and a 100th anniversary celebration was planned for 2020 and canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cMahler is really in the DNA of the orchestra,\u201d said Dominik Winterling, managing director of Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. \"You feel it because we have a certain tradition, which is also passed on from generation to generation.\"",
      "Bruno Walter and Leonard Bernstein were Mahler's other primary proponents in the 20th century.",
      "\u201cMy father, who was a musician, always told me: `Mahler was a great conductor and a good composer with some problems. Usually the form is not perfect and it\u2019s formless,'\u201d Iv\u00e1n Fischer said of S\u00e1ndor Fischer, also a conductor.",
      "When Bernstein led the Vienna Philharmonic in all of Mahler's symphonies over a decade starting in the mid-1960s, there was resistance.",
      "\u201cIn intervals, in corridors, everywhere musicians talk to each other, there was this: `Yes, it\u2019s good music but a little kitsch. Well, why does he need these bombastic effects?'\" Iv\u00e1n Fischer recalled. \u201cReally the cult of Mahler, where everybody started to love it, came after this cycle of Bernstein in Vienna but it was a spirit of the time. I think what created the breakthrough was that you didn\u2019t feel that music had to comport to certain norms and so it was a little liberation of the '60s, the time of free love, Beatles.\"",
      "Mahler has gained acceptance. The Fifth Symphony's adagietto was conducted by Bernstein at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s funeral and is featured in Luchino Visconti's 1971 film \u201cDeath in Venice\u201d and 2022's \u201cT\u00e1r.\u201d No. 2 sets a mood in a current Tony Award nominee, \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray.\u201d",
      "Though just 29, M\u00e4kel\u00e4 was a natural fit to lead off with the first symphony because he becomes both Concertgebouw chief conductor and CSO music director for the 2027-28 season. His exuberantly stepped down two dozen steps toward the podium to open his program with Anders Hillborg's \u201cHell Mountain,\u201d a world premiere commissioned for the festival that quotes two of Mahler's works.",
      "Van Zweden, who has a home a short walk from the Concertgebouw, was to open the canceled 2020 festival with the New York Philharmonic, when he was its music director. Van Zweden first heard Mahler When he was 6 or 7, van Zweden heard a fourth symphony led by Bernard Haitink, the Concertgebouw's chief conductor from 1961-88. A violinist in his youth, van Zweden became the orchestra's youngest concertmaster at age 19.",
      "\u201cThe scores of Mahler, what he gave us is a GPS system about the road of his life,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is such a human and we are such a witness of all the emotional roller-coasters and beauty and sadness and everything in his life during that performance. That is a different experience than a Tchaikovsky symphony.\u201d",
      "Luisi first heard Mahler when he attended a Fifth Symphony as a 15-year-old in Genoa, Italy.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know that this music could be so passionate and intense all the time \u2014 such a long symphony with a lot of different characters, different feelings, different moods,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI remember getting out of that concert shaking in pleasure and surprise.\u201d",
      "M\u00e4kel\u00e4 used a new edition of the score for No. 1 compiled by Michael Waterman, the fifth member of his family to play in the Concertgebouw in a lineage dating to 1950. With the help of his mom Cleora and friend Silvio Scambone, Waterman compiled markings going back to 1967. He now is working on editions of Nos. 5 and 9 based on notations dating to Mengelberg, who headed the orchestra from 1895-1945 before he was banned for his collaboration with Nazis.",
      "On Saturday, Fisher took a five-minute break between the first and second movements of No. 2, specified by Mahler but not often followed. In a hall famous for its precise acoustics, he drew breathtaking playing from horns that scampered on and off stage like NFL special teams.",
      "\u201cSo you hear these trumpets from heaven, everywhere, different directions,\u201d he said.",
      "M\u00e4kel\u00e4 is convinced Mahler has become more accessible in current times.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to the audience now because it\u2019s music that everyone can relate to,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so personal, it somehow gives you a possibility to self-reflect.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and Eurovision unite for an evening of music and intergalactic adventure on Saturday \u2014 all thanks to Russell T Davies.",
      "Before fans tune in for the annual song contest, they can enjoy Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor and Varada Sethu's Belinda Chandra attending the Interstellar Song Contest in an episode of the sci-fi series.",
      "In real life, the Eurovision Song Contest is an annual musical competition and TV event that sees 37 countries compete for a crystal microphone trophy over a four-hour live broadcast. In the interstellar version, aliens from 40 different worlds vie to win, also by singing.",
      "Davies says it took three years to pull it off the doubleheader because they had to work with the BBC to set the schedule and storylines in stone to ensure a perfect alignment.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sam Ryder took a \u201cSpace Man\u201d to Eurovision before, in 2022. Now, Gatwa will read out the U.K.\u2019s jury scores during the song contest's grand final, held this year in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "Talking to The Associated Press, Davies says that both Eurovision and \u201cDoctor Who\u201d share the DNA of old-fashioned Saturday night television, making the combination \u201cirresistible.\u201d",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "DAVIES: I almost think every episode of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is a great big celebration, sort of noise and color and spectacle, and that sums up Eurovision as well. In pitching this to Disney+ as well it\u2019s like, \u201cLook we\u2019re going out in 60 of your territories\u201d and Eurovision itself has a viewing figure that some years is bigger than the Super Bowl. There\u2019s not many shows that can say that on planet Earth.",
      "DAVIES: It\u2019s enormous fun. It could be said if you\u2019ve never seen a single Eurovision Song Contest in your life, you can still come along and watch this. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019d have made up for a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d story anyway.",
      "One day I\u2019ll do that \u201cABBA Voyage\u201d story where the holograms come to life and start killing people. That\u2019s the best idea ever. We\u2019ve got to do that one then. Can you imagine? That would be just amazing. I think there might be some copyright problems with that but we\u2019d overcome them.",
      "The actual pitch for the story to Juno (Dawson), who wrote it, was Eurovision meets \u201cDie Hard.\u201d So as you will see, the moment it starts, there\u2019s trouble, someone\u2019s out to sabotage it. There are villains behind the scenes trying to disrupt the program. All chaos is let loose and the rest of the episode is spent saving people\u2019s lives after that.",
      "DAVIES: I think there\u2019s four songs in total (by Murray Gold). Obviously we don\u2019t get to all 40 planets with their songs, but it was a very big production. We had to hive this off into its own production unit. There are scenes in the television gallery, where 40 different monitors have output of 40 different screens. And that\u2019s all been fed in live. That\u2019s not done with green screen afterwards, that\u2019s all stuff they\u2019d already shot. Crowds, acts, rehearsals, backstage, presenters, all of that stuff, playing onto that set, so it\u2019s terribly complicated.",
      "DAVIES: Frankly, they\u2019re all expensive. It was a lot, yes. It had to be planned very far in advance, more than any. Once you plan something carefully, then it costs less just because you\u2019re not busking. We allocate each story more or less the same amount of money. So I think it ends up costing as much as the others, but it just looks so good because they had so much time to plan it.",
      "DAVIES: We never say that. I don\u2019t know why, but we just don\u2019t ever do it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell me. I\u2019d faint.",
      "DAVIES: Yes, I will be. This will be a great night. I always sit and watch \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m old-fashioned \u2014 on its old-fashioned BBC One transmission at 7 o\u2019clock at night.",
      "I know people who have Eurovision parties, which I\u2019ve never gone to actually. Look at my life, it\u2019s devoted to television. I can\u2019t bear other people talking over it. That would just be a nightmare. So I will be sitting in. I\u2019ll get some nice dinner. I\u2019ll be a very happy man.",
      "DAVIES: I would like to go on a date with the man from Cyprus (Theo Evan). He\u2019s beautiful. I do like the U.K. entry this year (\u201cWhat the Hell Just Happened?\u201d by Remember Monday). I have a theory it\u2019s being underestimated in Great Britain. Just because we\u2019re so used to losing. We\u2019ve won five times, everyone. But this country gets a bit cynical about Eurovision sometimes. But I love our song. I think it\u2019s got a very memorable chorus.",

      "CANNES, France -- The 78th Cannes Film Festival got underway Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of French Riviera frenzy. Here are five things to look for at this year\u2019s Cannes:",
      "It might still be springtime, but, make no mistake, multiple Oscar campaigns will be launched in Cannes.",
      "Recent Cannes editions have produced several best-picture winners, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d and this year\u2019s winner, \u201cAnora\u201d by Sean Baker. The sway Cannes has on the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has only grown in recent years as the academy has expanded its overseas membership \u2014 many of them European voters who closely follow the buzz in Cannes.",
      "At the Oscars in March, three Cannes entries \u2014 \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 were among the 10 best-picture nominees. Less heralded movies can also emerge. The Latvian animated charmer \u201cFlow\u201d premiered last year in Cannes before its upset win at the Oscars.",
      "Before we get to the Academy Awards, though, Cannes will hand out its own prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.",
      "Deliberations by the jury (headed this year by Juliette Binoche ) are held entirely in private, so predicting the Palme is no easier than it was guessing the next pope. That doesn\u2019t stop bookies from handicapping the race and plenty of guesswork up and down the Croisette.",
      "This year\u2019s competition lineup features two previous Palme winners in Julia Ducournau (who returns with \u201cAlpha,\u201d her follow-up to \u201cTitane\u201d) and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (two-time winners, back this year with \u201cThe Young Mother\u2019s Home\u201d).",
      "Some of the movies that could be in the mix include Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident\u201d and Mascha Schilinksi\u2019s \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Or it could be Chie Hayakawa\u2019s \u201cRenoir,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value\u201d or Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d Or it could be \u2026 well, you get the idea.",
      "Cannes has a power to burnish even the most established stars, and its red carpet will, for the next 10 days, host a nonstop parade of them. (And they will be clothed, as per Cannes\u2019 latest etiquette protocol.)",
      "Among those on tap are Tom Cruise with \u201cMission Impossible: Final Reckoning\u201d on Wednesday; Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d with Denzel Washington; Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d with a cast featuring Benicio Del Toro and Michael Cera; Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "O\u2019Connor also stars in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d scheduled as one of the festival\u2019s last premieres.",
      "Three stars are coming to Cannes with their first features behind the camera: Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d). All are premiering in the Cannes sidebar Un Certain Regard, which means they won\u2019t have quite the pressure of the competition lineup. But there\u2019s no calm or easygoing section of Cannes, and each could emerge from the festival either minted as a filmmaker or humbled by critics.",
      "While Cannes movie screens light up with films, deal making transpires along the Croisette. Cannes draws studios, producers and sales agents all on the hunt for acquisitions. But when U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that he wants to enact tariffs on films made outside the U.S., it threw a giant wrench in the border-crossing dealmaking that Cannes specializes in. Yet with little detail on any possible tariffs and widespread doubt over its feasibility, the buying and selling of movies might not be slowed.",

      "Harouche told the court the trauma \u201cforever\u201d changed her friend, whom she\u2019s known since age 12, robbing her of a basic human right: freedom.",
      "\u201cShe now has a completely different lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of security, she can\u2019t go alone, she doesn\u2019t go alone to places anymore. To lose your sense of freedom ... it\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony is expected to recount how the attackers demanded her ring and left her fearing she would never see her children again.",
      "David De Pas, the lead judge, asked Harouche whether Kardashian had made herself a target by posting images of herself with \u201cjewels of great value.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Harouche replied. \u201cJust because a woman wears jewelry, that doesn\u2019t make her a target. That\u2019s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.\u201d",
      "Twelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. Another was excused due to illness. Most are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 nicknamed les papys braqueurs, or \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d \u2014 and authorities describe them as a seasoned and coordinated criminal gang.",
      "Two defendants have admitted being at the scene. The others deny involvement, and one claims he didn\u2019t know who Kardashian was. But police say the group tracked her via social media, where she had posted images of her jewelry, her hotel, and her schedule \u2014 exposing her vulnerability.",
      "The heist turned Kardashian into a cautionary tale of hyper-visibility. At the time, she was at the height of her influence \u2014 a style icon, social media pioneer and one of the most photographed women in the world.",
      "Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld criticized her after the robbery, telling The Associated Press she was \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth. Yet, as details emerged in the days after the heist, public sentiment shifted. The image of Kardashian \u2014 alone, bound, and pleading for her life \u2014 reframed her in the public eye.",
      "In the aftermath, Kardashian pulled back from the spotlight. She developed severe anxiety and later described symptoms of agoraphobia.",
      "\u201cI hated to go out,\u201d she said in a 2021 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to know where I was \u2026 I just had such anxiety.\u201d",
      "Later, she acknowledged that constant sharing had made her vulnerable: \u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Harouche, who hid in a downstairs bathroom during the robbery, said she also suffered trauma. She sought counseling for post-traumatic stress and left the celebrity styling world to become an interior designer.",
      "\u201cThat experience was very stressful for me. It made me fearful of being around celebrities,\" she said.",
      "Harouche said she went to bed before the robbery. Kardashian entertained friends upstairs. Screams jolted Harouche from her sleep.",
      "From inside the locked bathroom, she texted Kardashian\u2019s sister Kourtney and Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard that \u201csomething is very wrong,\u201d Harouche testified.",
      "Later, after the robbers had gone, she said she heard Kardashian hopping down the stairs with her ankles still bound to find her.",
      "\u201cShe was beside herself,\u201d Harouche said. \u201cShe just was screaming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021",
      "PARIS -- French movie star G\u00e9rard Depardieu on Tuesday was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court.",
      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d) in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cIt is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\u201d said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \u201cToday we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot like that.\u201d He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cnot credible\" and stressed both accusers' \u201cconstant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\u201d",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \u201caggressive\u201d defense strategy \u201cbased on comments meant to offend them.\u201d The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \u201cconsidered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \u201cin front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very moved,\" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that\u2019s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",
      "Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",
      "French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.",
      "The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.",
      "In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.",
      "A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.",
      "In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.",

Over the next 12 days, Cannes will play host to megawatt premieres including those of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning,\u201d Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio skirted the red carpet but drew a standing ovation when he presented De Niro with an honorary Palme d'Or. The moment, which brought together two of Martin Scorsese's most regular stars, came 49 years after \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d was crowned with the Palme d'Or.",
      "DiCaprio praised De Niro as \u201cthe archetype\u201d actor, while also praising the 81-year-old performer \u2014 a fierce critic of U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 for \u201cfighting for our democracy.\u201d When the crowd rose to its feet for a lengthy ovation for De Niro, DiCaprio handed him the Palme. \u201cThanks, kiddo,\u201d said De Niro.",
      "After thanking the festival, De Niro quickly turned to speaking about Trump, who recently said he wants to enact a tariff on films made outside the country.",
      "\u201cArt is the truth. Art embraces diversity. And that's why art is a threat to the autocrats and the fascists of the world,\u201d said De Niro. \u201cAmerica's philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of America's premier cultural institutions. He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education. And now he announced a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States. You can't put a price on connectivity.\u201d",
      "The opening ceremony, which preceded the premiere of Am\u00e9lie Bonnin\u2019s French romance \u201cLeave One Day,\u201d was attended by Tarantino, who emerged to grandly declare the festival open, and then promptly dropped the mic and walked off stage. On Wednesday, Tarantino will pay tribute to Western filmmaker George Sherman. Also in attendance: Sean Baker, the \u201cAnora\u201d director and last year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or winner.",
      "The ceremony capped a busy day at Cannes that included a three-film salute to Ukraine, the introduction of the jury that will decide the Palme d'Or, headed by Juliette Binoche, and the debut of a restoration of Charlie Chaplin's \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d for its 100th anniversary.",
      "Cannes is coming off a 2024 festival that produced a number of eventual Oscar contenders, including \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cThe Substance,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d and the best picture winner, \u201cAnora. \u201d Asked Monday if he's feeling the pressure this time around, festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux said the only kind of pressure he believes in is in beer.

      "Along with Binoche, the other eight jurors include Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong, who was unable to attend Cannes last year for the premiere of his Trump film \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Strong referenced that film, which led to his first Oscar nomination, in his comments on the American president Tuesday.",
      "\u201cTruth is under assault,\u201d said Strong. \u201cSpecifically at this temple of film, the role of film is increasingly critical because it can combat those forces in the entropy of truth, and can communicate truths, individual truths, human truths, societal truths, and affirm and celebrate our shared humanity.\u201d",
      "Berry, responding to Cannes' new protocols on attire for the red carpet, said she had \u201can amazing dress\u201d with a long train for the opening ceremony but wore something else instead. Cannes has outlawed nudity and dresses with long trains for its evening premieres at the Palais.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

      "California\u2019s governor once again called upon the state\u2019s cities and counties to ban homeless encampments",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California's governor called upon the state's cities and counties to ban homeless encampments this week, even providing blueprint legislation for dismantling the tents lining streets, parks and waterways throughout much of the state.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, made homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019. It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",
      "Still, he has repeatedly called out cities and counties to do their part, and on Monday, he unveiled draft language that can be adopted by local governments to remove encampments. Here is what to know:",
      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "U.S. health officials say a listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people",
      "A listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people in the U.S., and a producer is voluntarily recalling dozens of products sold to retail stores, hospitals, hotels, airports and airlines, federal officials said.",
      "The products were made by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC and were sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington.",
      "Those who fell ill and were hospitalized were in California and Nevada. The outbreak has been simmering for many months: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cases date to December 2023.",
      "Listeria poisoning is caused by a particularly resilient type of bacteria that can survive and grow even during refrigeration. About 1,600 people are infected with it \u2014 and 260 die \u2014 each year in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The voluntary recall covers more than 80 specific products distributed between April 18 and April 25. The products have \u201cUse By\u201d dates from April 22 to May 19.",
      "Brand names include: Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away.",
      "Federal officials say anyone with the products should throw them away or return them. They also suggest cleaning any surfaces that touched the recalled foods.",
      "Listeria bacteria thrive in moist environments, including soil and water and decaying vegetation and are carried by some animals.",
      "The hardy germs are typically spread when food is harvested, processed, transported or stored in places that are contaminated with the bacteria.",
      "When the bacteria get into a food processing plant, they can be tough to eradicate.",
      "Foods contaminated with the bacteria can make people sick. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up.",
      "Those most vulnerable to getting sick include the very young, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",
      "Listeria can survive and grow in refrigerated food. It can be killed by heating foods to \u201csteaming hot,\u201d or 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius), the CDC says. But that's not always possible \u2014 or palatable \u2014 for foods that are made to be eaten cold.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

      "Mexican prosecutors say a social media influencer in the Mexican state of Jalisco who was shot dead during a livestream on TikTok appeared to be murdered by a hit man and expressed fear before being killed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The social media influencer who was shot dead during a live stream on TikTok in the Mexican state of Jalisco appeared to be murdered by a hit man and expressed fear before being killed, prosecutors said on Thursday.",
      "The grisly murder of 23-year-old Valeria M\u00e1rquez on Tuesday shocked the Latin American nation, igniting rumors about the motive behind her killing in a region that's been eclipsed by cartel violence in recent years. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her administration is working with local investigators to track down the killer and extended her condolences to M\u00e1rquez's family.",
      "Denis Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office, provided new details on the killing on Thursday, but said prosecutors were still investigating the death of the model and beauty influencer with more than 113,000 followers on the social media app.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez said that early Tuesday afternoon, hours before the shooting, a masked man posing as a delivery driver arrived at the beauty salon on the outskirts of Guadalajara, accompanied by another man on a motorcycle. According to a woman in the salon, the men said they had a \u201cvery expensive\u201d gift for M\u00e1rquez that they had to deliver in person. When M\u00e1rquez arrived and heard people were looking for her she expressed fear in her livestream.",
      "\u201cMaybe they were going to kill me,\u201d she said in the video minutes before she was killed. \u201cWere they going to come and take me away, or what? I'm worried.\u201d",
      "When the men returned, they asked if it was M\u00e1rquez who was now in the salon, something that prompted prosecutors to believe that the men were hired assassins, Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "\u201cThe aggressor arrived asking if the victim (M\u00e1rquez) was there. So it appears he didn't know her,\" Rodr\u00edguez said. \"With that, you can deduce \u2014 without jumping to conclusions \u2014 that this was a person who was paid. It was obviously someone who came with a purpose.\u201d",
      "M\u00e1rquez was handed a stuffed animal and a bag of Starbucks coffee while she was on the livestream, and was shot in the head and the chest, collapsing on camera. TikTok has since taken down the influencer's account.",
      "While it was still unclear who was behind the killing, the region is firmly controlled by one of the most powerful cartels in Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and Rodr\u00edguez noted murders by hired guns on motorcycles, often known as \u201csicarios,\u201d have become a common occurrence.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez said that authorities were also investigating if the death was connected to the murder of a former congressman just hours earlier in the same area of Guadalajara, also carried out by two men on a motorcycle.",

      "Over a thousand disarmed Congolese soldiers and police officers, along with their families have safely been transferred from the rebel-controlled city of Goma in eastern Congo to the capital Kinshasa over the last two weeks",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Over a thousand disarmed Congolese soldiers and police officers, along with their families, have safely been transferred from the rebel-controlled city of Goma in eastern Congo to the capital over the last two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced Thursday.",
      "The soldiers and police officers had been taking refuge at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo\u2019s base since January, when the decades-long conflict in eastern Congo escalated as the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma.",
      "The Red Cross said in a statement it helped escort the 1,359 disarmed members of the government forces and their families from Goma to the capital Kinshasa between April 30 and May 15th, traveling nearly 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) and across a front line.",
      "The ICRC said it accompanied several convoys on the road, while transport by helicopter and plane was carried out by the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in Congo and the country\u2019s armed forces.",
      "\u201cThe operation has been a success, it has enabled those transported to Kinshasa to get back in touch with their families and, we hope, will reduce tensions in the city of Goma,\u201d Myriam Favier, head of the ICRC\u2019s sub-delegation in Goma, said.",
      "The transfer of the government forces was the result of an agreement reached between the Congolese government, the rebels, the U.N. mission and the ICRC, which was called upon as a neutral intermediary, the Red Cross said, adding that it made sure that all the individuals had consented to being transported in the convoys.",
      "For security reasons, no media outlets were allowed to film or photograph the operation.",
      "The news of the successful transfer comes amid persistent tensions in eastern Congo, where fighting between Congo\u2019s army and M23 continues, despite both sides having agreed to work toward a truce last month.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in and out of crisis for decades. Dozens of armed groups are vying for territory in the mining region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "The M23 rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the west.",
      "On Thursday, Congolese authorities accused Rwanda\u2019s army and M23 of having killed dozens and abducted thousands in eastern Congo.",
      "Last week, Congo and Rwanda submitted a draft peace proposal as part of a U.S.-led process, with the Trump administration eyeing access to critical minerals in the resource-rich region.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s claim this week that there is an unreported \u201cgenocide\u201d happening against white farmers in South Africa was his harshest accusation yet against a country he has moved to punish over a range of issues",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- U.S. President Donald Trump's claim this week that there is an unreported \u201cgenocide\u201d happening against white farmers in South Africa was his harshest accusation yet against a country he moved to punish over a range of issues soon after returning to office.",
      "Trump's criticism has focused mostly on his allegations that South Africa's government is fueling anti-white racism in the majority Black country, leading to the killing of white farmers. That has been denied by the South African government.",
      "But Trump has also strongly criticized South Africa's foreign policy, and especially its decision to take Israel to the United Nations' top court and accuse it of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Trump has cited that case against a U.S. ally as an example of what he referred to as a larger anti-American position from South Africa. The U.S. president has now accused South Africa, once a key partner in Africa, of the same crime of genocide.",
      "South Africa launched its highly contentious genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice in early 2024, putting a developing nation that's not a diplomatic heavyweight at the forefront of the pro-Palestinian movement at an especially divisive time. South Africa's decision caused tensions with the U.S. under the Biden administration and other Western countries, which rejected the accusation that Israel was committing genocide.",
      "But Trump's reaction has been much stronger, citing the case against Israel in an executive order on Feb. 7 that sanctioned South Africa and stopped all U.S. aid and assistance. The order said South Africa had taken \u201caggressive positions towards the United States and its allies\u201d and the case showed its support for the Palestinian militant group Hamas.",
      "The U.S. government under Trump has also cracked down on pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel protests at home.",
      "South Africa has long been a supporter of the Palestinian people and a critic of Israel. But while the government has attempted to draw a line between that and any support for Hamas, the distinctions have become blurred, like when the grandson of former South African President Nelson Mandela hosted Hamas officials on a visit to South Africa in 2023.",
      "Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the European Union, the U.K. and others.",
      "Trump's executive order also accused South Africa of strengthening its ties with Iran through commercial, military and nuclear arrangements. South Africa holds diplomatic ties with Iran but said it does not have any agreements with Iran over nuclear weapons, though it is allowing Iran to bid, alongside other countries, for a commercial contract to build a nuclear reactor to provide electricity.",
      "South Africa's Institute for Security Studies, a nonprofit research institute, said that Trump was \"overreacting\" to South Africa's relationship with Iran, but South Africa \u201calso shouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has decided to effectively boycott South Africa's presidency of the Group of 20 developed and developing nations this year, the first time an African nation has held the rotating presidency.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg in February, saying South Africa's theme of \u201csolidarity, equality and sustainability\u201d was effectively DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and climate change and he wouldn't waste American taxpayer money on it. The Trump administration has moved to dismantle DEI programs in the U.S.",
      "Shortly after Rubio skipped the meeting, the Trump administration suspended all cooperation with South Africa related to its hosting of G20 events, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations, said the decision was because Trump does not support South Africa's G20 agenda. The official said the move would not affect the U.S.'s presidency of the G20 next year.",
      "The rebuff by the U.S. will likely undermine South Africa's efforts to make progress on issues it has prioritized for its presidency.",
      "The Trump administration brought more than 50 white South Africans to the U.S. this week as refugees, saying they are members of the minority Afrikaner group and are being persecuted by their Black-led government and exposed to race-based violence.",
      "South Africa says it condemns the relatively small number of killings of white farmers, but the cause is being mischaracterized and they are a result of its problems with violent crime and not racially motivated.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has not criticized Trump directly but said the U.S. president is being fed false information by some Afrikaner lobby groups in South Africa and some conservative commentators in the U.S. who have elevated the issue.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said he will meet with Trump at the White House next week in an attempt to \"reset\" the countries' relationship.",

The Vatican under Pope Francis had worked for prisoner exchanges, as well as for the return of Ukrainian children taken to live in Russian-occupied territories.",

      "In his first Sunday noon blessing as pope, and again during an audience with pilgrims from eastern rite churches this week, Leo has appealed for an end to the war and expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of USAID has put more than 8,000 health workers in South Africa\u2019s national HIV program out of work",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- The Trump administration's dismantling of USAID has put more than 8,000 health workers in South Africa's national HIV program out of work, the country's health minister said Thursday, as he outlined the impact of U.S. funding cuts on the biggest AIDS treatment project in the world.",
      "The cuts have also closed down 12 specialized HIV clinics that were run by non-governmental organizations in South Africa and funded by the United States Agency for International Development through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told reporters.",
      "He said health authorities are now registering the more than 60,000 patients who were served by those clinics at state health facilities to continue their life-saving treatment.",
      "South Africa has nearly six million people on HIV medication, more than any other country in the world.",
      "The clinics that were defunded by the U.S. were largely treating what are known as \u201ckey populations,\u201d Motsoaledi said. They include gay men and sex workers who are considered at higher risk of HIV infection and who sometimes face stigma at public health facilities.",
      "Motsoaledi said that the Trump administration had terminated around $436 million annually in funding for HIV treatment and prevention in South Africa, which made up part of the $2.5 billion a year program. The South African government and other donors fund the rest.",
      "Viral load testing \u2014 which measures how much the HIV virus is present in the blood of patients on treatment \u2014 had decreased by 21% since the aid cuts began to take effect in February, the health minister said. He didn\u2019t give figures on how the testing program to find those who are HIV positive had been affected.",
      "HIV treatment and prevention is one of the areas that has been impacted most by the termination of U.S. foreign aid, especially in sub-Sahara Africa.",
      "The head of the United Nations AIDS agency told The Associated Press in February that the number of new HIV infections globally could jump more than six times by 2029 because of the funding cuts.",
      "Motsoaledi denied South Africa's national program was on the brink of collapse, but outlined significant problems like personnel shortages, funding shortfalls, and the difficulties in locating HIV positive persons that need to start treatment.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s move to terminate more than 90% of foreign aid through the USAID agency has undermined a near 20-year effort to stop HIV deaths in the country worst-hit by the disease. U.S. funding has been critical for South Africa's efforts to stop people dying of AIDS, largely through helping provide free antiretroviral medication that stops the virus replicating in the body.",
      "\u201cWe must put it categorically clear that under no circumstances will we allow this massive work performed over a period of more than a decade and a half to collapse and go up in smoke because President Trump has decided to do what he has done,\u201d Motsoaledi said. \u201cIf we do so, we will have thrown massive investment in time, money and human resources away. And at any rate, we don\u2019t want to go back to the period where death was the order of the day.\u201d",
      "South Africa has around 7.7 million people living with HIV, according to the U.N. AIDS agency. Not all of them are on treatment despite it being free. South Africa has recently embarked on a drive to get 1 million more people on treatment.",
      "The 8,061 health workers who lost their jobs make up more than half of the health workers funded by USAID through PEPFAR, Motsoaledi said. He said South Africa still has more than 250,000 health workers in the HIV program paid by the government and other donors.",
      "While South Africa still has donors like the Global Fund providing financial assistance for its HIV program, Motsoaledi said it was lobbying other governments and aid agencies for assistance, but no new funding had been secured aside from the R1 billion ($55.3M) that the Global Fund has allocated for antiretroviral medication.",

      "The government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who made tougher migration policy a central plank of his campaign for Germany\u2019s election in February, took office on May 6. The following day, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said more police would be stationed at the border to curb irregular migration and some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe\u2019s biggest economy would be turned away.",
      "Speaking on Thursday as he visited the Kiefersfelden crossing on Germany\u2019s southern frontier with Austria, Dobrindt said 739 people were turned back at the borders over the past seven days, a 45% increase over the previous week\u2019s figure of 511.",

      "Germany\u2019s previous government already had introduced checks at the country\u2019s borders with neighboring nations, which the new administration is stepping up.",

      "Albania already had a five-year agreement with Italy to potentially shelter up to 36,000 migrants annually while their asylum requests were fast-tracked by Italy. Under the original deal - which differs from what the U.K. is proposing - Italy would take back any migrants whose requests are rejected and attempt to deport them. But the plan has, so far, failed due to repeated challenges in Italian courts.",
      "In April, Italian authorities changed their migrant disembarkation agreement to a variation of the \u201creturn hub\u201d model and transferred 40 people to Albania who lacked Italian residency permits and whose asylum requests had been denied. It was the first time a European Union country sent rejected asylum seekers to a non-EU country that was neither their own nor one they had transited through on their journey.",
      "Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the agreement with Italy was a \u201cone off\u201d and that Tirana had turned down several requests for similar deals with other countries, ruling out the possibility that the U.K. would send rejected asylum-seekers there.",
      "The Conservative U.K. government that was voted out of power in July had planned a controversial program to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which they said was a safe third country. Starmer called his predecessor's program a gimmick and scrapped it on his first days in office.",
      "Under that program, asylum seekers would be flown to Rwanda, which would decide whether to grant asylum there.",
      "Under the \u201creturn hubs\u201d Starmer is discussing, migrants whose asylum claims are rejected by the U.K. would be sent to a third country to await deportation. A spokesperson for Starmer said the goal is to prevent failed asylum seekers from using stall tactics, such as starting a family in Britain, to prevent being sent back.",
      "Migration expert Meghan Benton said there's a lot of confusion between the different programs set out by the U.K. and other European countries. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of legal and moral differences between them,\u201d Benton, who leads Global Programs at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said. While the Rwanda deal shifted the U.K.'s responsibility for asylum to a third country, Starmer's proposal involves people who have exhausted their asylum claims, Benton explained.",
      "Several European countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, are looking to do the same, Benton added. The \u201creturn hubs\u201d concept has also been supported by the European Commission as a way to deter irregular migration.",
      "During his visit to Albania Thursday, the British prime minister also said a joint task force has helped significantly reduce the number of Albanian migrants trying to reach the UK. His government is in talks with Western Balkan countries to set up similar task forces, aiming to cut through the tangle of bureaucracy that hinders progress in reducing migrant arrivals, he added.",
      "The number of Albanians crossing the English Channel in unsafe inflatable rafts in search of higher-paying jobs has dropped from 12,000 in 2022 to some 600 in 2024.",
      "\u201cQuite an incredible reduction,\u201d Starmer said at a news conference with Rama. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a signal and an example of what can be done when two countries work together in this way.\u201d",
      "While the number of Albanians arriving on English shores has fallen, the total number of migrants crossing the channel on small boats has increased by more than 30% so far this year, compared to the same period last year, according to an AP analysis of data released by the Home Office.",
      "Top British officials in 2022 called Albanians\u2019 arrivals \u201can invasion,\u201d sparking a diplomatic spat. Rama had called that a \u201ccrazy narrative\u201d and an attempt to cover up for the U.K.\u2019s failed border policies. Albanians cannot seek asylum status in the U.K., which considers Albania to be a safe country.",
      "In the same year, London and Tirana signed an agreement to return Albanians arriving on boats in the U.K. London also has funded projects, especially in northeastern Albania  where most of the illegal newcomers were from.",
      "Rama pledged to continue the partnership with Britain on discouraging migrant arrivals from Albania.",
      "Starmer's visit to Albania is the first by a British prime minister. The two countries also signed a statement of intent for defense industry cooperation to work together on the manufacture of military vehicles in Albania.",
      "The British leader will take part Friday in the European Political Community in Tirana, a forum that gathers European leaders with the aim of boosting security and prosperity across the continent.",

However, that administration lacked the parliamentary majority to implement the change.",

      "Mickoski, for his part, said the bloc\u2019s enlargement must be based on merits, not bilateral issues. His conservative government, which came to power last year, has said it will only amend the constitution if Bulgaria first approves North Macedonia\u2019s EU membership.",
      "\u201cWe have a problem, and it should be a two-way street. If only one side delivers, it is not realistic,\" he said. \"We have done enough with difficult decisions so far. We have changed the flag; we have changed the name. ... On the other hand, they (Bulgaria) have a delivery equal to zero.\u201d",
      "Costa is visiting six Western Balkan countries, which are at different stages on their path to full EU membership. Montenegro and Albania have been at the forefront while Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and North Macedonia are lagging behind.",

      "In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over.

      "Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the U.S.-China trade war persists.",
      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Though Trump kept the 10% baseline tariffs on U.K., he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum.",

      "Economists said growth will likely falter in the second quarter as new taxes on business were imposed in April. Also a raft of price rises during the month, including domestic energy and water bills, are expected to keep a lid on consumer demand.",

      "Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Turkish capital Ankara that the Russian delegation doesn\u2019t include \u201canyone who actually makes decisions.\u201d",
      "But he said that to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine is seeking an end to the 3-year-old war that he had decided to send officials from Ankara to Istanbul for the meeting.",
      "Their aim is \u201cto attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war \u2014 namely, a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed away Thursday from proposed direct peace talks on ending the war in Ukraine, leaving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy waiting in the Turkish capital of Ankara after he had challenged the Kremlin leader to face-to-face negotiations.",
      "With Putin absent, the Russian delegation was in Istanbul \u2014 more than 400 kilometers (almost 300 miles) west of Ankara \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t clear whether the sides would even meet for their first such talks since March 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor the previous month.",
      "Zelenskyy said the Russian delegation appeared to be merely \u201ca theater prop\u201d following a weekend of diplomatic brinksmanship between Moscow to Kyiv in the 3-year-old war.",
      "Putin\u2019s absence punctured hopes of a breakthrough in peace efforts that were given a push in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders amid the intense maneuvering. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.",
      "Speaking at the airport in Ankara, Zelenskyy said the next steps for talks would be decided after his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who welcomed him with an honor guard at the presidential palace in Ankara.",
      "\u201cNow, after three years of immense suffering, there is finally a window of opportunity,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said at a NATO meeting taking place separately in Turkey. \u201cThe talks ... hopefully may open a new chapter.\u201d",
      "The war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the U.N., and continues along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.",
      "At least five civilians were killed and 29 injured in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia\u2019s army is trying to advance.",
      "The diplomatic maneuvering began over the weekend when European leaders met Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step toward peace. Putin later responded by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Then came Zelenskyy's challenge to Putin for face-to-face talks.",
      "After days of silence, the Kremlin finally responded Thursday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Putin has no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not surprised that Putin was a no-show. Trump had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet but brushed off Putin\u2019s apparent decision not to attend.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for Putin to go if I\u2019m not there,\u201d Trump told reporters at a meeting with business executives in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.",
      "Trump said a meeting between him and Putin was crucial to break the deadlock.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything\u2019s going to happen whether you like it or not, until (Putin) and I get together,\u201d he said on Air Force One while traveling from Doha to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\u201d",
      "Peskov said Putin has no plans to meet with Trump in the coming days.",
      "Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, is leading the Russian team that will also include three other senior officials, the Kremlin said. Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as \u201cexperts\u201d for the talks in Istanbul.",
      "Also absent from the talks were Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin\u2019s foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia in March.",
      "The top-level Ukrainian delegation included Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy will sit at the negotiating table only with Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.",
      "Details about whether, when and where the Ukrainian delegation might meet their Russian counterparts were unclear. Russia said the talks have been postponed until the afternoon \u201cat the initiative of the Turkish side\u201d",
      "Tass said the talks were to take place in a presidential office on the Bosporus, in Istanbul.",
      "Putin met Wednesday evening with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Peskov said. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov, and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu also attended.",
      "The Kremlin billed Thursday\u2019s talks as a \u201crestart\u201d of peace negotiations that were held in Istanbul in 2022 but quickly fell apart. Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia\u2019s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something both sides could agree on.",
      "Russia's delegation then was also headed by Medinsky.",
      "Putin's proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kickstarted by Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the devastating war swiftly \u2014 though it's been hard to pull off. The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated that it might walk away from the peace effort if there was no tangible progress soon.",
      "Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, met with U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in the Turkish city of Antalya, which is hosting NATO foreign ministers to discuss new defense investment goals as the U.S. shifts its focus to security challenges away from Europe.",
      "Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s mediation efforts and thanked the U.S. for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to \u201creciprocate Ukraine\u2019s constructive steps\u201d toward peace. \"So far, it has not,\u201d Sybiha said.",
      "On Thursday morning, Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of \u201cmassive sanctions\u201d if Russia doesn't comply.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,\" Rubio said Thursday.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Putin of \u201cstanding in the way of peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was only one country that started this conflict -- that was Russia. That was Putin. There\u2019s only one country now standing in the way of peace -- that is Russia, that is Putin,\u201d he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.",
      "Barrot echoed that sentiment: \u201cIn front of Ukrainians there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cVladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.\u201d",

      "Trump also said that Qatar\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, had been pushing for diplomatic deal over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Qatar shares a massive offshore oil and gas field that\u2019s crucial to its wealth with Iran.",

It said that the new plans, coupled with the \u201csystematic destruction\u201d of civilian infrastructure and the block on all imports into Gaza, were cause for signatories to the Genocide Convention to act to prevent Israel\u2019s moves.

      "A new museum is opening in the Netherlands focused on migration",
      "ROTTERDAM, Netherlands -- A gleaming spiral staircase jutting from the roof of a former Dutch warehouse overlooks the waterway where millions of Europeans once boarded ships bound for a new life in the United States.",
      "The twisting path, intended to represent migrants' unexpected journeys, stands on the Fenix museum, the newest attraction on Rotterdam's waterfront.",
      "The museum tells the story of migration, with exhibits including thousands of suitcases from travelers, portraits of refugees and a life-sized city bus.",
      "Architect Ma Yansong of Chinese firm MAD Architects told The Associated Press he wanted the building to serve not only as a museum but also as \u201ca memory.\"",
      "The museum opens Friday as migration is on the rise, along with anti-immigrant sentiment in many parts of the world. The number of people living outside their country of birth \u2014 over 300 million \u2014 has nearly doubled since 1990, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cAs long as we exist as human beings, we move and we migrate. And we will always keep on doing that. And that\u2019s what we show in Fenix,\u201d said the museum\u2019s director, Anne Kremers.",
      "As the museum's construction continued last year, the hard-right Dutch government announced unprecedented measures aimed at reining in migration, including a reintroduction of border checks. It shattered a long-held image of the Netherlands as a nation that welcomed new arrivals.",
      "The museum's viewing platform looks out across Rotterdam, whose 650,000 inhabitants represent over 170 nationalities. The city is the largest port in Europe.",
      "Many of those departing Rotterdam in the early part of the 20th century made the trans-Atlantic journey on the Holland America Line, a shipping company founded by the Van der Vorm family in 1873. The family has been the primary financial backer for the Fenix project, via Dutch art foundation Droom en Daad (Dream and Action).",
      "Art can sometimes provide a better basis for discussion of politically loaded topics like migration, said Cathrine Bublatzky, an anthropologist who studies the intersection of art and migration.",
      "Kremers said she hopes visitors will take away \u201cwhat it feels like to leave your home, to find a new home, and to say farewell.\u201d",

      "Voters in Poland will cast ballots Sunday in a presidential election to choose a successor to conservative incumbent Andrzej Duda",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- A war next door in Ukraine.Migration pressure at borders. Russian sabotage across the region. Doubts about the U.S. commitment to Europe's security.",
      "In Poland\u2019s presidential election Sunday, security looms large. So do questions about the country\u2019s strength as a democracy and its place in the European Union. One of the new president\u2019s most important tasks will be maintaining strong ties with the United States, widely seen as essential to the survival of a country in an increasingly volatile neighborhood.",
      "Voters in this Central European nation of 38 million people will cast ballots to replace conservative incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second and final five-year term ends in August.",
      "With 13 candidates, a decisive first-round victory is unlikely. Some have appeared unserious or extreme, expressing openly pro-Putin or antisemitic views. A televised debate this week dragged on for nearly four hours. There are calls to raise the threshold to qualify for the race.",
      "A runoff on June 1 is widely expected, with polls pointing to a likely showdown between Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023.",
      "Poland\u2019s geography gives the election added importance. Bordering Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave, Belarus and war-torn Ukraine \u2014 as well as several Western allies \u2014 Poland occupies a critical position along NATO\u2019s eastern flank and serves as a key logistics hub for military aid to Ukraine.",
      "Fears are rising that if Russia prevails in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it could target other countries that freed themselves from Moscow's control some 35 years ago. Against that backdrop, the election will shape Warsaw\u2019s foreign policy at a moment of mounting strain on trans-Atlantic unity and European defense.",
      "Both leading candidates support continued U.S. military engagement in Europe. Trzaskowski puts greater emphasis on deepening ties with the European Union, while Nawrocki is more skeptical of Brussels and promotes a nationalist agenda.",
      "When Law and Justice held power, it repeatedly clashed with EU institutions over judicial independence, media freedom and migration.",
      "While Poland is a parliamentary democracy, the presidency wields significant influence. The president serves as commander-in-chief, holds veto power, shapes foreign policy and plays a symbolic role in national discourse.",
      "Under Duda, the office largely advanced the conservative agenda of Law and Justice. Since Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist coalition came to power in late 2023, Duda has blocked key reforms aimed at restoring judicial independence and repairing relations with the EU.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are enormous for the ruling coalition and for those concerned with the future of Polish democracy,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw think tank. \u201cThis is about democratic reform and restoring the rule of law \u2014 and that can only happen with cooperation from the next president.\u201d",
      "The election is also pivotal for Law and Justice, Kucharczyk noted: \u201cIts future as a dominant political force may hinge on the outcome.\u201d",
      "Both Trzaskowski and Nawrocki have pledged to support Ukraine and maintain strong defense ties, but their visions for Poland diverge sharply on the role of the EU and domestic social policy.",
      "Trzaskowski, 52, is a former presidential contender and a senior figure in Civic Platform, the centrist party led by Tusk. He is running on a pro-European platform and has pledged to defend judicial independence and rebuild democratic institutions.",
      "Supporters describe him as a modernizer who represents a cosmopolitan, outward-facing Poland. He speaks foreign languages, has marched in LGBTQ+ parades and appeals to younger, urban voters. Trzaskowski's progressive views highlight an evolution of the once more conservative Civic Platform.",
      "Nawrocki, 42, represents how the party backing him, Law and Justice, is turning further to the right as support for the hard right surges.",
      "Nawrocki, who is not a Law and Justice party member, heads the state-backed Institute of National Remembrance, which investigates Nazi and communist-era crimes. He has drawn praise from conservatives for dismantling Soviet monuments and promoting patriotic education, but he faces criticism for inexperience and playing on anti-German and other resentments. He has also been embroiled in some scandals.",
      "Earlier this month, Nawrocki met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 a symbolic moment welcomed by Law and Justice-friendly media as proof that he would be the best man for keeping the relationship with the United States strong. Critics viewed it as interference by Trump's administration.",
      "This week Nawrocki was joined on the campaign trail by Romanian nationalist George Simion, who faces a runoff vote for the presidency on Sunday. Simion is viewed by critics as pro-Russian, leading Tusk to tweet: \"Russia is pleased. Nawrocki and his pro-Russian Romanian counterpart George Simion on the same stage five days before the presidential elections in Poland and Romania. Everything is clear.\u201c",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a nervous time for the global economy,\u201d he told reporters while launching the midyear forecast. \u201cIn January this year, we were expecting two years of stable \u2014 if subpar \u2014 growth, and since then, prospects have diminished, accompanied by significant volatility across various dimensions.\u201d",

      "Economic growth in the United States is now projected to drop significantly, from 2.8% last year to 1.6% this year, it said, noting that higher tariffs and policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on private investment and consumption.",
      "China\u2019s growth is expected to slow to 4.6% this year from 5% in 2024 as a result of subdued consumer sentiment, disruptions in its export-oriented manufacturing companies, and continuing challenges in its property sector, the report said.",
      "The European Union\u2019s growth is forecast to remain the same this year as it was last year \u2014 just 1%, the report said, citing weaker net exports and higher trade barriers. The United Kingdom\u2019s economic growth of 1.1% last year is projected to fall to 0.9%.",
      "Weakening trade, slowing investments and falling commodity prices are also forecast to erode growth in other major developing economies, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa.",

      "The U.N.\u2019s global economic growth forecast is lower than the International Monetary Fund\u2019s.",
      "On a more positive note, Mukherjee said the U.N. is expecting that bilateral negotiations will lead to lower tariffs, although he said they won\u2019t return to the levels before U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s February announcement.",
      "Nonetheless, Mukherjee said, resolving uncertainties would help individuals and businesses move forward with economic decisions and that would have a positive impact on the global economy.",

      "Much like its creator, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok was preoccupied with South African racial politics on social media this week, posting unsolicited claims about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people.",
      "The chatbot, made by Musk's company xAI, kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in response to users of Musk's social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. Musk, who was born in South Africa, frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Musk and his companies haven\u2019t provided an explanation for Grok's responses, which were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, but on Thursday the absence of any explanation forced those outside the company to make their best guesses.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Graham's post brought what appeared to be a sarcastic response from Musk's rival, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.",
      "\u201cThere are many ways this could have happened. I\u2019m sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,\u201d wrote Altman, who has been sued by Musk in a dispute rooted in the founding of OpenAI.",
      "Some asked Grok itself to explain, but like other chatbots, it is prone to falsehoods known as hallucinations, making it hard to determine if it was making things up.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees Monday, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group as Trump suspends refugee programs and halts arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression and has now been decried by Musk and others as promoting the killing of whites. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck believes the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically very random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "The National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Thursday showing the number of airline and ship passengers who entered the country last month using business visas.",
      "The Middle East was the only region that saw higher business travel to the U.S., with arrivals up 9.4% compared to April 2024. But that didn't make up for big losses from other regions; the number of business travelers from Western Europe fell 17.7%, for example.",
      "The new government data didn't include people coming from Canada for business or who traveled by land from Mexico. Mexican arrivals by air for those holding business visas were down 11.8%, the government said.",
      "And overall travel from Canada also fell in April. According to Statistics Canada, Canadian residents' return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Business travel to the U.S. held up better than leisure travel in the first quarter of the year. According to U.S. government data, more than 1.2 million travelers entered the U.S. using business visas in the January-March period, up 7% from the year before. The number of travelers using tourist visas fell 6%.",
      "But that flipped in April, as the late Easter holiday likely encouraged more leisure travel. Travel to the U.S. by international travelers holding tourist visas was up 13.8% in April.",
      "It's unclear if that trend will hold. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said an analysis of online travel agency data indicated that advance bookings from Europe to 14 U.S. cities in June, July and August were down 12% from those same months last year.",
      "Multiple U.S. airlines have pulled their financial forecasts for the year, citing uncertainty and weaker demand from lower-fare leisure travelers. Many industry experts think business travel to the U.S. will continue to decline in the coming months.",
      "Leslie Andrews, the global travel leader for real estate company JLL and a board member at the Global Business Travel Association Foundation, said she thinks corporate travel to the U.S. will slow in the second and third quarters of the year as the full impact of economic and geopolitical volatility sets in.",
      "\u201cWhat I am hearing is, \u2018Things were good in the first quarter,\u2019 but in the second quarter it\u2019s a matter of, \u2018Must you take that trip?\u2019\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThey\u2019re pulling in the reins a bit to make sure only purposeful travel is happening as things grow and evolve.\u201d",

      "Kevin Haggarty usually travels to the United States from Canada several times a year to attend trade shows in Atlanta or Las Vegas or to visit suppliers in Los Angeles. But his concerns about crossing the border will keep him from making those trips this year.",
      "Haggarty, who owns a company that sells gifts and souvenirs, said Canadian retailers no longer want U.S.-made merchandise. His U.S. suppliers are struggling to stay afloat due to U.S. tariffs on products made in China. Above all, he\u2019s concerned about reports of international travelers being detained at the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cHonestly, my nervousness and reluctance to cross into the U.S. stems from that more than any hostility to the American market,\u201d said Haggarty, who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Global Business Travel Association CEO Suzanne Neufang said a poll of more than 900 of the association\u2019s members last month showed nearly one-third expected a decline in global travel volumes this year.",
      "Canadian members were the most pessimistic, with 71% saying they expect a decrease in travel this year, Neufang said.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty is unnerving for a business travel sector that likes to be safe and likes to be efficient,\u201d she said.",
      "A drop-off in business trips would represent a setback for the U.S. travel industry and cities that host international conventions and trade shows. The $1.6 trillion global business travel sector was finally returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. business travel spending reached pre-COVID levels in 2023, Neufang said, while the rest of the world achieved that last year.",
      "Brett Sterenson, the president of Hotel Lobbyists, a Washington firm that helps groups book hotels for meetings and conferences, said he was losing international business as some countries warn travelers not to visit the U.S.",
      "U.S. government cuts are also hurting business, Sterenson said. He works with several groups that offer international exchange programs through the State Department. The programs welcome travelers from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and elsewhere and share best practices on things like energy policy and environmental stewardship, he said. But with funding cuts, that part of his business is down 75%.",
      "\u201cThese exchanges were monumentally useful in spreading goodwill, but also in educating developing nations on good governance,\u201d Sterenson said.",
      "Haggarty, in Canada, said he canceled a trip to a trade show in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and said several retailers he works with also pulled out. He\u2019s now looking to England, France, Spain and other markets for goods to sell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s much easier to bring products to Canada from the U.S., but we\u2019re in a corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know just how much damage this administration is doing to their relationships globally.\u201d",

Compared to a year earlier, producer prices rose 2.4% last month, decelerating from a 3.4% year-over-year gain in March, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday.",

      "Economists had forecast that producer prices rose modestly in April.",
      "Services prices fell 0.7%, the biggest drop in government records going back to 2009, on shrinking profit margins at wholesalers and retailers. Wholesale food prices fell 1%, and egg prices plunged 39%, though they are still up nearly 45% from a year ago because of bird flu.",

      "Sales at retail stores and restaurants rose just 0.1% in April from March, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That is much lower than the previous month's 1.7% gain, which reflected a surge in car sales as consumers sought to get ahead of President Trump's 25% duty on auto imports that went into effect this month.",
      "Last month's tiny increase after the March surge makes it harder to get a clear read on consumer spending trends and reflects the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty in the economy in the wake of Trump\u2019s stop-and-go tariff policies. Many publicly-traded companies have withdrawn or held off on the traditional practice of forecasting their revenues and earnings for the rest of this year because the economic landscape has become so chaotic.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are increasingly gloomy about the economy\u2019s prospects, according to sentiment surveys, but it's not yet evident whether that will translate into reduced spending and slower economic growth.",
      "In April, sales were flat or down for many retailers: They plunged 2.5% at sporting goods stores, which saw prices jump last month, according to the government's inflation report earlier this week. Sales dropped 0.4% at clothing stores, while they ticked down 0.2% at health and personal care stores and slipped 0.1% at auto dealers.",
      "Gas station sales dropped 0.5%, even as prices declined 0.1%. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes.",

      "And sales at home and garden centers jumped 0.8%, the biggest gain since 2022, which suggests Americans are pursuing more home renovations as elevated mortgage rates cooled home sales.",
      "Trump imposed sky-high tariffs on imports from China last month that fueled fears of a recession, higher inflation, and even the specter of empty shelves by the winter holidays.

Yet profits slipped and CEO Doug McMillon said the company would soon raise prices to offset the impact of tariffs.",
      "Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items when the duties were so high, raising worries about empty shelves for the key back-to-school and holiday seasons. But many are now scrambling to resume shipping their goods from China while there is a pause in the trade war.",

      "\u201cWe need to understand that Russia has officially tied and connected itself to the Russian shadow fleet,\u201d Tsahkna said, and underlined the importance of air patrols over the Baltic Sea, saying that \u201cwe need to understand that the situation is really serious.\u201d",

      "\u201cSports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we\u2019ll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, hundreds of thousands of older Americans with decades-old debts are now at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished",
      "NEW YORK -- Christine Farro has cut back on the presents she sends her grandchildren on their birthdays, and she\u2019s put off taking two cats and a dog for their shots. All her clothes come from thrift stores and most of her vegetables come from her garden. At 73, she has cut her costs as much as she can to live on a tight budget.",
      "But it\u2019s about to get far tighter.",
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, a surprising population has been caught in the crosshairs: Hundreds of thousands of older Americans whose decades-old debts now put them at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished.",
      "\u201cI worked ridiculous hours. I worked weekends and nights. But I could never pay it off,\u201d says Farro, a retired child welfare worker in Santa Ynez, California.",
      "Like millions of debtors with federal student loans, Farro had her payments and interest paused by the government five years ago when the pandemic thrust many into financial hardship. That grace period ended in 2023 and, earlier this month, the Department of Education said it would restart \u201cinvoluntary collections\u201d by garnishing paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits. Farro previously had her Social Security garnished and expects it to restart.",
      "Farro\u2019s loans date back 40 years. She was a single mother when she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in developmental psychology and when she discovered she couldn\u2019t earn enough to pay off her loans, she went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree. Her salary never caught up. Things only got worse.",
      "Around 2008, when she consolidated her loans, she was paying $1,000 a month, but years of missed payments and piled-on interest meant she was barely putting a dent in a bill that had ballooned to $250,000. When she sought help to resolve her debt, she says the loan company had just one suggestion.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Move to a cheaper state,\u2019\u201d says Farro, who rents a 400-square-foot casita from a friend. \u201cI realized I was living in a different reality than they were.\u201d",
      "Student loan debt among older people has grown at a staggering rate, in part due to rising tuitions that have forced more people to borrow greater sums. People 60 and older hold an estimated $125 billion in student loans, according to the National Consumer Law Center, a six-fold increase from 20 years ago. That has led Social Security beneficiaries who have had their payments garnished to balloon by 3,000% over the same period, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "An estimated 452,000 people aged 62 and older had student loans in default, according to a January report from CFPB.",
      "Debbie McIntyre, a 62-year-old adult education teacher in Georgetown, Kentucky, is among them. She dreams of retiring and writing more historical fiction, and of boarding a plane for the first time since high school. But her husband has been out of work on disability for two decades and they\u2019ve used credit cards to get by on his meager benefits and her paycheck. Their rent will be hiked $300 when their lease renews. McIntyre doesn\u2019t know what to do if her paycheck is garnished.",
      "She floats the idea of bankruptcy, but that won\u2019t automatically clear her loans, which are held to a different standard than other debt. She figures if she picks up extra jobs babysitting or tutoring, she could put $50 toward her loans here and there. But she sees no real solution.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what more I can do,\u201d says McIntyre, who is too afraid to check what her loan balance is. \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this hole.\u201d",
      "Braxton Brewington of the Debt Collective debtors union says it\u2019s striking how many older people dial into the organization\u2019s calls and attend its protests. Many of them, he says, should have had their debts cancelled but fell victim to a system \u201criddled with flaws and illegalities and flukes.\u201d Many whose educations have left them in late-life debt have, in fact, paid back the principal on their loans, sometimes several times over, but still owe more due to interest and fees.",
      "For those who are subject to garnishment, Brewington says, the results can be devastating.",
      "\u201cWe hear from people who skip meals. We know people who dilute their medication or cut their pills in half. People take drastic measures like pulling all their savings out or dissolving their 401ks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know folks that have been driven into homelessness.\u201d",
      "Collections on defaulted loans may have restarted no matter who was president, though the Biden administration had sought to limit the amount of income that could be garnished. Federal law protects just $750 of Social Security benefits from garnishment, an amount that would put a debtor far below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing people with federal benefits with one hand and taking them away with another,\u201d says Sarah Sattelmeyer of the New America think tank.",
      "Linda Hilton, a 76-year-old retired office worker from Apache Junction, Arizona, went through garnishment before COVID and says she will survive it again. But flights to see her children, occasional meals at a restaurant and other pleasures of retired life may disappear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to mean restrictions,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any travel. There won\u2019t be any frills.\u201d",
      "Some debtors have already received notice about collections. Many more are living in fear. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order calling for the Department of Education\u2019s dismantling and, for those seeking answers about their loans, mass layoffs have complicated getting calls answered.",
      "While Education Secretary Linda McMahon says restarting collections is a necessary step for debtors \u201cboth for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d even some of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters are questioning a move that will make their lives harder.",
      "Randall Countryman, 55, of Bonita, California, says a Biden administration proposal to forgive some student debt didn\u2019t strike him as fair, but he\u2019s not sure Trump\u2019s approach is either. He supported Trump but wishes the government made case-by-case decisions on debtors. Countryman thinks Americans don\u2019t realize how many older people are affected by policies on student loans, often thought to be the turf of the young, and how difficult it can be for them to repay.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a young person\u2019s problem today,\u201d he says, \u201cis an old person\u2019s problem tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Countryman started working on a degree while in prison, then continued it at the University of Phoenix when he was released. He started growing nervous as he racked up loan debt and never finished his degree. He\u2019s worked a host of different jobs, but finding work has often been complicated by his criminal record.",
      "He lives off his wife\u2019s Social Security check and the kindness of his mother-in-law. He doesn\u2019t know how they\u2019d get by if the government demands repayment.",
      "\u201cI kind of wish I never went to school in the first place,\u201d he says.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Elmo, Abby Cadabby and the rest of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d gang will get some high-profile help as they travel down a new road.",
      "The Sesame Workshop \u2013 founded in 1969 and currently working on its 56th season, but its first that will not be distributed by PBS or HBO \u2013 received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award Wednesday, which will provide the nonprofit a $250,000 grant as well as support in promoting its work from the Elevate Prize Foundation. Previous winners of the award include Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, actor Michael J. Fox, and NBA great Dwyane Wade.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t just entertained generations \u2013 they\u2019ve educated, advocated and inspired real change,\u201d Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcia Jayaram, said as she presented the award to The Sesame Workshop at the foundation\u2019s Make Good Famous Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. \u201cAnd their work hasn\u2019t just been confined to the screen. Through their nonprofit, they\u2019ve expanded their mission globally. They\u2019ve created real world programs that bring education, health and hope to millions of children in over 150 countries.\u201d",
      "Sal Perez, the show\u2019s executive producer and a Sesame Workshop vice president, said the organization planned to use the award to let more people know that its nonprofit work extends beyond the TV show.",
      "\u201cWe do a lot of work around the world with direct services, trying to provide content for families that talks about some of those harder to talk about subjects, whether it\u2019s trauma, whether it\u2019s homelessness and things of that nature. So this is an opportunity to highlight that kind of work.\u201d",
      "Perez told The Associated Press in an interview before the ceremony that there would be news about Sesame Workshop\u2019s future released \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery decided not to renew its deal for new episodes that air on HBO and Max, though episodes will remain on the streaming service until 2027.",
      "\u201c\u2019Sesame Street\u2019 is not going to go away,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt will never go away. It\u2019s obviously been a beloved show for so long.\u201d",
      "However, there are changes coming to the new season, which currently has no distribution deal. Perez said the segments on the new season will be longer and \u201creally focused on character,\u201d while also focusing on its audience's emotional well-being and development.",
      "\u201cThe more kids want to hang out with our characters on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 the more they\u2019re going to take in those lessons,\u201d said Perez, adding that there would also be updates to the show's look and feel. The new season will also feature more exploration of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d neighborhood and a look inside the legendary two-story brownstone at 123 Sesame Street.",
      "Though Sesame Workshop does not currently receive any government funding, Perez urged viewers to support public media, especially following President Donald Trump's recent executive order to cut funding to PBS and NPR.",
      "\u201cWe believe in the power that public funding has for children\u2019s media,\" he said. \"I think people should support their local PBS affiliates and support children\u2019s media because it is an entry point for children to really start to see the world outside of their homes.\u201d",
      "Jayaram said she felt the time was right to for the Elevate Prize Foundation to stand with The Sesame Workshop and its work.",
      "\u201cThis is a foundation that\u2019s about social impact,\" she said. \"So the symbolism of us joining forces with a children\u2019s program is to say that even though our leaders are grown adults, it\u2019s the child in all of us that we need to revive and remember our essential values as humans.\u201d",
      "Famed roommates Bert and Ernie were on hand to receive the award alongside Perez with their trademark banter. \u201cWe are so proud to make the Catalyst,\u201d joked Ernie. \u201cOne day we'd also like to make the Dog-alist.\u201d",
      "In a video acceptance, Abby and Elmo took their own swing at explaining the award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a spark that makes good change happen \u2013 kinda like magic,\u201d explained Abby.",
      "\u201cElmo really likes being a catalyst,\u201d said Elmo.",

      "Colombian lawmakers have once again blocked President Gustavo Petro\u2019s efforts to overhaul labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Lawmakers in Colombia on Wednesday once again blocked President Gustavo Petro's efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, this time by rejecting a referendum that would have asked voters whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "Petro asked Congress earlier this month to approve the 12-question referendum to give voters a chance to decide on the changes that lawmakers themselves had already rejected twice. He had warned lawmakers against blocking the referendum, saying before thousands of people gathered for a Labor Day demonstration on May 1 that if they did not approve it, Colombians would punish them at the polls during the 2026 legislative elections.",
      "After an intense debate Wednesday, 49 senators voted against the measure and 47 in favor.",
      "Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, characterized the vote as fraudulent. He has repeatedly accused lawmakers of blocking his social initiatives and ignoring the demands of Colombians.",
      "Had lawmakers approved the referendum, voters would have answered questions such as whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "In a rarely used maneuver, a group of congressmen on Wednesday successfully appealed the March dismissal of Petro's proposed labor reform. The move allows lawmakers to again debate his proposals and potentially approve them. Lawmakers face a June 20 deadline to do so.",

      "NEW YORK -- The chair of Tesla sold more than $230 million of company stock since Elon Musk's endorsement of Donald Trump triggered boycotts and protests against his cars, sending its profits and stock price plunging.",
      "More than half of Robyn Denholm's cash haul came from sales in the first four months this year as Tesla stock fell by one-third, according to filings reviewed by The Associated Press. In total, she unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares \u2014 more than half her holdings as dictated by a pre-arranged selling plan filed with regulators as Musk began embracing right-wing politics.",
      "Denholm filed that plan on July 25, the day Musk endorsed Trump for president.",
      "Denholm's profits were likely outsized, too. That is because many of the shares she sold had been acquired through so-called options granted to her by Tesla years earlier that, given recent stock prices, allowed her to buy at a deep discount, according to data from research provider FactSet. Nearly a million shares acquired through options were bought for $25, less than a tenth of the market price for much of the last nine months.",
      "The AP reached out to both Tesla and Denholm but did not receive an immediate reply.",
      "A Denholm statement to The New York Times, which earlier reported on the insider sales, said that the share value of holdings by Tesla directors has jumped because the stock itself has soared, creating \u201coutsized returns\u201d for all shareholders.",
      "It's not clear why Denholm decided to cash out so much of her stake.",
      "Pre-determined selling schedules are used by executives and directors as a way of telling investors that their selling isn't based on insider information, which is illegal, or necessarily a sign that they have turned pessimistic about a company.",
      "Denholm isn't the only Tesla insider who has been selling. The chief financial officer and other directors have unloaded $189 million in stock in the same nine-month period, according to FactSet data.",
      "Tesla stock soared after Trump was elected in November on hopes that the president-elect's close relations with Musk would translate to less regulatory scrutiny and bigger profits.",
      "But Musk's role as the government cost-cutting chief for Trump and his comments supporting extreme right-wing politicians in Europe have triggered a backlash among car buyers, and sales have sunk along with its stock.",
      "Tesla reported last month that profits in the first three months of the year plunged 71%.",
      "The stock soared again after Musk, the company's chief executive and biggest shareholder, said he would be stepping back from his Washington work to spend more time at the electric automaker.",
      "Tesla closed at $347 a share Wednesday, up 4% for the day and more than 50% since its April low.",

      "There were cheers when Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump\u2019s package past overwhelming Democratic opposition",
      "WASHINGTON -- Cheers broke out early Wednesday as Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a grueling round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump's package past overwhelming Democratic opposition.",
      "But there's still more work to do.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also worked past midnight trying to resolve issues with Trump's plan. Opposition is mounting from various corners of the GOP majority as he tries to muscle the party's signature package to passage without any votes from Democrats.",
      "On the one hand, the conservative leader of the Freedom Caucus derides the new Medicaid work requirements as a \u201cjoke\u201d that do not go far enough at cost-cutting. Meanwhile, a handful of GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states are refusing to support the measure unless changes are made to give deeper state and local tax deductions, called SALT, for their constituents back home.",
      "\"To say we have a gulf is an understatement,\" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the conservative wing.",
      "Roy said there is \u201ca significant number of us who could not bless this product\u201d in its current form.",
      "Nevertheless, momentum is building toward an end-of-the-week inflection point to stitch together the sprawling package Friday at the Budget Committee. That means combining hundreds of pages of bill text covering $5 trillion in tax breaks and at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions on Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs to deliver Trump's second-term legislative priority.",
      "Democrats decry the package as a give-away to the wealthy at the expense of safety net programs that millions of Americans rely on. But Johnson insists the Republican majority is on track to pass the package by Memorial Day, May 26, sending it to the Senate where Republicans are crafting their own version. With his slim majority, he can only afford a few defections from his ranks.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still on target,\u201d Johnson said at the Capitol. \u201cThe American people are counting on us.\u201d",
      "Democrats also stayed up all night forcing marathon public hearings. One at the House Energy and Commerce Committee was still going more than 26 hours later before finishing Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Later Wednesday evening, the House Agriculture Committee handling the food aid cuts wrapped up its work too, but only after the Republican chairman abruptly shut down debate on dozens of remaining amendments from Democrats.",
      "All told, Democrats proposed hundreds of amendments trying to change the package, with dozens of votes that largely failed.",
      "\u201cIt is a cruel, mean, rotten bill,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., as the Agriculture panel debated changes to the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said at least 7.6 million fewer people would have health insurance with reductions to Medicaid, and likely more with additional changes to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The CBO also gave lawmakers a preliminary analysis showing that 3 million fewer people each month would participate in the SNAP food program under the changes proposed.",
      "More than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, and about 40 million use SNAP.",
      "The Republicans are targeting Medicaid and SNAP for a combined $1 trillion in cuts as a way to offset the costs of the tax package, but also to achieve GOP goals of reining in the social safety net programs.",
      "Most of the cost-savings would come from imposing stiffer work requirements for those receiving the health care and food assistance, meaning fewer people would qualify for the aid. The legislation would raise from 54 to 64 the age of able-bodied adults without dependents who would have to work to qualify for SNAP. It also would also require some parents to work to qualify for the benefits once their children are older than 7, instead of 18. Under current law, those recipients must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours a month.",
      "The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., insists the changes would \u201cstrengthen and sustain\u201d Medicaid for the future, and are the kind of \u201ccommon sense\u201d policies Trump promised voters.",
      "But Democrats told repeated stories of their constituents struggling to access health care. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., revealed his own diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes at the House Ways and Means Committee hearing and the sticker shock of health costs.",
      "One of the most difficult issues for Johnson has been the more localized debate over state and local taxes as he works to come up with a compromise for New York, California and New Jersey lawmakers. They have rejected an offer to triple the deduction cap, now at $10,000, to $30,000 for married couples.",
      "The speaker met with lawmakers Tuesday and talks continued into Wednesday.",
      "Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said it was cordial, but there was no deal. \u201cMore sizzle than steak in that meeting,\u201d he said late Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is you need 218 votes to pass a bill and the way this bill is currently constructed, it will not have that because it does not adequately the issue of SALT,\u201d said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.",
      "The lawmakers believe they have leverage in the talks because without a deal, the $10,000 limit established under the 2017 tax bill expires at the end of the year and reverts to no cap at all.",
      "But as Johnson and the lawmakers edge closer to a SALT deal, the conservatives are balking that their priorities must also be met.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said he\u2019s a no for now, but would be working to improve the bill so that he could support it.",
      "The conservatives argue that the tax breaks without deeper spending cuts will pile onto the deficit, and they worry that the Medicaid reductions do not go far enough in rolling back federal funds to expand the Affordable Care Act. They also want the work requirements, which don't take effect until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump has left office, to start sooner.",
      "\"Basically Republicans are enforcing Obamacare, which is a surreal situation to me,\u201d Burlison said.",
      "Republicans are racing to extend Trump's tax breaks, which are set to expire later this year, while adding the new ones he campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and others.",
      "A new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that most tax filers would see a lower tax rates under the proposal, except those at the lowest rates, who earn less than $15,000 a year. Their average tax rate would go up.",

      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks\u2019 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",
      "\u201cStarbucks has lost its way. Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\u201d said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t care what color our clothes are when they\u2019re waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\u201d",
      "Summers and others also criticized the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees no longer are allowed to wear to work on an internal website. Starbucks said it would give two free black T-shirts to each employee when it announced the new dress code.",

      "Maryland has lost its triple-A bond rating from Moody\u2019s",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland lost its triple-A bond rating from Moody's on Wednesday, a rating the state has cited for more than 50 years as a sign of strong fiscal stewardship.",
      "Moody\u2019s downgraded the state\u2019s credit rating to Aa1. Maryland had received a triple-A bond rating from Moody\u2019s since 1973. The state has benefitted from the higher rating by paying the lowest rates when it sells bonds to pay for infrastructure, likes roads and schools.",
      "\u201cThe downgrade was driven by economic and financial underperformance compared to Aaa-rated states, which is expected to continue given the state\u2019s heightened vulnerability to shifting federal policies and employment, and its elevated fixed costs,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore and other leading Maryland Democrats blamed President Donald Trump's mass layoffs of federal workers, which is having a big impact on the region. The District of Columbia also recently received a credit-rating downgrade.",
      "\u201cTo put it bluntly, this is a Trump downgrade,\" Moore said in statement made jointly by the presiding officers of the state's legislature, Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck Davis, who are all Democrats. \u201cOver the last one hundred days, the federal administration\u2019s decisions have wreaked havoc on the entire region, including Maryland.\u201d",
      "Maryland Republicans described the downgrade as \u201ca harsh indictment of the state\u2019s current direction under Governor Wes Moore.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t downgrade Maryland\u2019s bond rating \u2014 Annapolis Democrats did. And now they\u2019re scrambling for someone else to blame,\" Republican Sen. Steve Hershey, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement. \"This is the result of reckless spending, bloated budgets, and an economy that\u2019s been hollowed out by overregulation and overreliance on the federal government.\u201d",
      "Moody's had noted earlier this year that federal cuts pose a greater threat to Maryland than any other state.",
      "Maryland lawmakers recently concluded a challenging legislative session to balance the state's budget. They closed a $3.3 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year with a combination of tax increases, budget cuts and fund transfers.",
      "Maryland lawmakers also directed the governor's budget office to keep track of the impact of federal cuts, alert them if it reaches $1 billion and make recommendations on how to deal with the impact.",
      "The Democrats' statement noted that Moody's acknowledged that the state had closed its budget gap, even as it remains exposed to the economic consequences of federal funding cuts and layoffs.",
      "\u201cMaryland still holds one of the highest possible credit ratings in the nation,\" the joint statement said, \u201cand as we have for decades, we will always pay our debts.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Ted Cruz asked whether a hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D",
      "A hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D.C., that hasn't worked for more than three years may have contributed to another near miss shortly after the U.S. Army resumed flying helicopters in the area for the first time since January's deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, Sen. Ted Cruz said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic controllers, Frank McIntosh, confirmed the agency didn't even know the hotline hadn't been working since March 2022 until after the latest near miss. He said civilian controllers still have other means of communicating with their military counterparts through landlines. Still, the FAA insists the hotline be fixed before helicopter flights resume around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "The Army said in a statement Wednesday that is it \u201cworking with the FAA to resolve the direct communications line between the Pentagon pad tower and the DCA tower and determine what repairs are required to restore services.\u201d DCA is the code for Reagan airport.",
      "It said the Army \u201ccontinues to restrict flights to the Pentagon pad to only mission essential operations until the line is repaired or improved communication procedures are implemented and accepted by the FAA.\u201d",
      "The FAA said in a statement that the dedicated direct access line between air traffic controllers at Reagan and the Pentagon's Army heliport hasn't worked since 2022 because of the construction of a new tower at the Pentagon. But the FAA said \u201cthe two facilities continue to communicate via telephone for coordination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe developments at DCA in its airspace are extremely concerning,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis committee remains laser-focused on monitoring a safe return to operations at DCA and making sure all users in the airspace are operating responsibly.\u201d",
      "The Army suspended all helicopter flights around Reagan airport after the latest near miss, but McIntosh said the FAA was close to ordering the Army to stop flying because of the safety concerns before it did so voluntarily.",
      "\u201cWe did have discussions if that was an option that we wanted to pursue,\u201d McIntosh told the Senate Commerce Committee at the hearing.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said \u201cthe fact that they were unaware that this connection was not working for three years is troublesome.\u201d But he is not entirely clear on the purpose of the hotline when controllers had other ways to communicate.",
      "But Guzzetti thinks the Army needs to be more forthcoming about what it is doing to ensure the airspace around Washington remains safe. Since the crash, the Army has at times refused to provide information that Congress has asked for, and officials didn't answer all the questions at a previous hearing.",
      "\u201cThe DCA airspace is under the white hot spotlight. So the Army\u2019s going to have to be more transparent and more assertive in their dealings with this problem,\u201d Guzzetti said.",
      "According to a U.S. official, one course of action under consideration now is to have the Army give 24 hours notice of any flights around National Airport. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made and discussions are ongoing.",
      "January's crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people \u2014 making it the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001. The National Transportation Safety Board has said there were an alarming 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the crash that should have prompted action.",
      "Since the crash, the FAA has tried to ensure that military helicopters never share the same airspace as planes, but controllers had to order two planes to abort their landings on May 1 because of an Army helicopter circling near the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cAfter the deadly crash near Reagan National Airport, FAA closed the helicopter route involved, but a lack of coordination between FAA and the Department of Defense has continued to put the flying public at risk,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth said.",
      "McIntosh said the helicopter should never have entered the airspace around Reagan airport without permission from an air traffic controller.",
      "\u201cThat did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cMy question \u2014 and I think the larger question is \u2014 is why did that not occur? Without compliance to our procedures and our policies, this is where safety drift starts to happen.\u201d",
      "The NTSB is investigating what happened.",
      "In addition to that incident, a commercial flight taking off from Reagan airport had to take evasive action after coming within a few hundred feet of four military jets heading to a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. McIntosh blamed that incident on a miscommunication between FAA air traffic controllers at a regional facility and the tower at Reagan, which he said had been addressed.",

    "story": [
      "The Oilers have been the team that didn\u2019t seem bothered by giving up four goals because they were more than capable of scoring at least five",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The Oilers have been the team that didn't seem bothered by giving up four goals because they were more than capable of scoring at least five.",
      "And, with Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl anchoring the team, Edmonton can still win shootouts.",
      "But winning a Stanley Cup has been elusive because an uncertain defense and shaky goaltending has largely been the Oilers' undoing. That doesn't appear to be the case anymore as they prepare to face Dallas or Winnipeg in the Western Conference final.",
      "The Oilers wrapped up their second-round NHL playoff series by shutting out the Golden Knights over the final six periods of regulation and 7:14 of overtime to win in five games. Vegas, which finished fifth in the regular season with 3.34 goals per game, had trouble generating any kind of offense in those last two games.",
      "The Golden Knights had just a combined 15 high-danger chances in those games, according to Natural Stat Trick, and 37 scoring chances overall.",
      "\u201cI think it was our commitment to not giving up odd-man rushes,\u201d Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse said. \"Vegas is a very good team when it comes to odd-man rushes and capitalizing off of defensive turnovers. We were very conscious of keeping the five guys between our net and the puck and getting above their good-skating defensemen.",
      "\u201cSo I think we had a much more conscious effort to get pucks deep and kind of play a simple game and build off that.\u201d",
      "That defense made life considerably easier for beleaguered goalie Stuart Skinner, who was benched just two games into the playoffs after allowing 11 goals in the first two games of the opening series against Los Angeles.",
      "Journeyman Calvin Pickard entered the crease and helped the Oilers roll off six consecutive victories to eliminate the Kings and take early control against the Golden Knights. But Pickard was injured in Game 2 of the Vegas series, and Skinner returned to the net.",
      "His struggles continued in Game 3, allowing four goals to go with an .833 save percentage, and the Golden Knights won their only game \u2014 on a Reilly Smith goal with .4 seconds left.",
      "Just throwing the puck on net against a struggling goaltender seemed like a recipe for Vegas to pull out the series victory. Except the Golden Knights didn't get many such chances, their entries into the offensive zone disrupted and their space to operate once there negated.",
      "\u201cI think the last two nights we defended pretty well in front of (Skinner),\" Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cWas it perfect? No. Were there some chances? Definitely. He came up big the last two nights.\u201d",
      "Or, as McDavid put it about Skinner, \u201cHopefully, it shuts a lot of people up talking about him.\u201d",
      "Skinner or Pickard, if he's back, will be tested in the next series and will go against a team with an elite goalie, be it Jake Oettinger of the Stars or Vezina Trophy favorite Connor Hellebuyck of the Jets.",
      "Maybe these back-to-back performances will serve Skinner well.",
      "\u201cBeing able to come back in no matter what the scenario was and being able to have the resiliency in me is something I can be proud of,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cSo much of it has to do with how the guys are playing in front of me. The way they've played ever since I've come back in is impressive.\u201d",
      "Not just for Skinner, but for the entire Oilers team, beating Vegas had the added benefit of revenge in what is becoming one of the Western Conference's top rivalries.",
      "The Golden Knights kept the Oilers from getting out of the second round two years ago, and it was Vegas that wound up lifting the Stanley Cup. The Oilers made it to the final last year only to lose in seven games to Florida, but they didn't have to get past the Golden Knights.",
      "This time, Edmonton did and in commanding fashion.",
      "\u201cThere's probably a lot of people that thought it was going to go longer than five (games) and probably not a lot of people that thought we would win,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cIt's nice to keep on rolling, to keep on proving people wrong. We've got a lot of belief in this room. It's fun to be part of.\u201d",

The Leafs have gone 6-8 in those 14 games. On one hand, the eight losses mean the season always ends in disappointment and with another year tacked onto the drought since the city last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. On the other, the six wins show that it's been tough to land the knockout blow.",

      "The Panthers \u2014 who got goals from three defensemen in Wednesday's win \u2014 have gotten goals from 15 different players in the series, compared with only nine goal-scorers for Toronto. It's been remarkably balanced for Florida on that front; Sam Bennett has three goals, while Aleksander Barkov, Brad Marchand and Carter Verhaeghe each have two, and 11 others have scored once.",
      "Nylander has three goals in the series for Toronto, while Matthews is 0 for 20 on shots in the series \u2014 and 0 for 28 against Florida this season when tacking on the regular season.",

      "Rodgers has had talks about signing with Pittsburgh but hasn't made a final decision if he wants to play in 2025, leaving the Steelers with Mason Rudolph and rookie Will Howard currently at the top of the depth chart.",
      "The league still gave the Steelers four prime-time games and one standalone international game in Ireland in Week 4 in the schedule released Wednesday, banking that the team's strong following and history of success under coach Mike Tomlin will make them an attractive team for networks no matter what Rodgers decides.",
      "\u201cWe tried to play it down the middle,\u201d NFL scheduling executive Mike North said Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything more than than anybody else. The schedule was built for Coach Tomlin and for the Steelers. If Aaron decides to play, it probably just makes many, if not all, the Steelers games a little more interesting.\u201d",
      "North said the Steelers' opener against one of Rodgers' former team, the New York Jets, likely would not have been in a 1 p.m. EDT regional window had the league known for sure that Rodgers would play.",
      "But the league made sure that a potential game between Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers, for whom he won four MVPs and a Super Bowl, did get prime-time treatment in Week 8 on NBC's Sunday night package instead of having it crowded into an afternoon window.",
      "\u201cIf it fell on a Sunday afternoon, for instance, it becomes a dominant story of the day, Aaron\u2019s first game against his old team,\" North said. \"So put it in a national window, if Aaron is the quarterback, it\u2019s a great story. If Aaron\u2019s not the quarterback, it\u2019s still Packers-Steelers Sunday Night Football in Week 8. It sounds like a football game.\u201d",
      "The success of last season's rookie quarterback class was evident in the schedule led by Washington's Jayden Daniels getting eight standalone games, including five in prime time, and three others in the late afternoon doubleheader window.",
      "The other five first-round QBs from the 2024 draft also got their share of high-profile games, with J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings getting seven standalone games, including a Monday opener against Caleb Williams and Chicago, plus two international games.",
      "Michael Penix and Atlanta have six standalone games, with Williams and the Bears and Bo Nix and the Denver Broncos getting five each, and Drake Maye and New England getting three.",
      "\u201cWhen we meet with all the broadcast partners at the beginning of this process, and they make their list of, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s some of the games and some of the teams that we\u2019d most be interested in,\u2019\u201d North said. \u201cObviously, you\u2019ve got your healthy dose of Dallas and Kansas City on there. But a definite representation Lions, Washington, Denver, teams that have played their way in the bigger national television windows.\u201d",
      "For the second straight year, the NFL will go head to head against college football on the day the College Football Playoff has scheduled three quarterfinal games. The NFL gave Fox a doubleheader featuring an NFC title game rematch between Philadelphia and Washington and an NFC North division showdown between Green Bay and Chicago.",
      "NFL executive Hans Schroeder said the league has no plans to move games off that weekend even with the CFP now in place, saying the NFL has played games on the third Saturday in December in 37 of the past 40 seasons.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an NFL day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think our fans love having football on that day. We love having football late in the year. There\u2019s a lot of stories to tell at that point as we\u2019re running into the playoffs in our chase for the playoffs. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. You have to ask the CFP how they\u2019re thinking about the future.\u201d",
      "With the opponents for each team determined by a formula and known since the day the last season ended, much of the attention on schedule release days is on other factors.",
      "One that has gotten more attention in recent years from outsiders is rest disparity, with some teams forced to play more games against teams coming off a bye or Thursday night games than other teams.",
      "The NFL said it has found that teams on more rest have only a slight advantage. That means that while it is a factor in choosing a schedule, it's only one of many, including getting the best games in the best TV windows, stadium availability, balancing games between network partners, international games, bye weeks and long road trips.",
      "After being on the short end of the stick with a rest disparity of worse than minus-20 in each of the past two seasons, the San Francisco 49ers were on the plus end this season with games against teams coming off a bye and a rest advantage overall.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re certainly hopeful that we found a schedule this year that wasn\u2019t a significant negative total disparity for the 49ers,\u201d North said. \u201cWe happened to. But I wouldn\u2019t say that if we thought the very best schedule overall had the 49ers at minus-8 or minus-10 or minus-12 that we couldn\u2019t have played it. It would have been a factor, but maybe not a disqualifying one.\u201d",
      "The Raiders have the worst rest discrepancy this season at minus-17 days, and Washington is the only team with four games against opponents coming off a bye.",

      "To spread out the three Triple Crown races",
      "BALTIMORE -- Sovereignty is not running out of that starting gate in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby. Yet he is still the talk of Pimlico Race Course this week.",
      "That is because owners and trainer Bill Mott opted to skip the Preakness and with it a chance at the Triple Crown because of the short turnaround. It is the second time in four years the Derby winner is not taking part for that reason and the fifth time in seven years overall the Preakness goes on with no Triple Crown on the line.",
      "The trend has reignited the debate about what, if anything needs to change with the Triple Crown, with ideas ranging from putting more space between the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to adding incentives to run in all three to changing the order of the races altogether. Like starters in baseball throwing fewer pitchers, elite horses now typically get much longer time between races, and the situation has put tradition and modernization of the sport head to head.",
      "The two-week turnaround now feels to many around the sport like an antiquated schedule when longer gaps are now the norm with an eye toward horse wear and tear and better performance. Thoroughbreds used to be trained and run at a much quicker interval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a question that has more than one side to it,\u201d said Steve Asmussen, who has won more races than any other trainer in North America. \u201cI love how hard it is to do, which makes it so special. And then would it be making it easier? Does it dilute it? That\u2019s a great question. And I think that it\u2019ll continue to be debated.\u201d",
      "It was debated constantly during the 37-year drought between Triple Crown champions from Affirmed in 1978 until Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah swept the three races in 2015. Baffert\u2019s Justify did it in 2018, too, and the chorus of voices calling for change was quieted.",
      "But then, for various reasons, there has been a Triple Crown chance in the Preakness only twice in the past seven years. The biggest draw of the middle leg \u2013 the anticipation for the possibility \u2013 went from being automatic to anything but.",
      "\u201cIt is troubling, and it has been troubling for several years,\u201d said Jerry Bailey, a Hall of Fame jockey who won each of the three races twice and is now an NBC Sports analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s completely flip-flopped from my generation when it was the rule that they would run back and the exception that they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Many top trainers, including Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, Mark Casse and Michael McCarthy have run a Derby horse in the Preakness or will this year. Others, like Mott, Chad Brown, Todd Pletcher and Brad Cox, are more reluctant to take the risk.",
      "\"We need them in the game,\u201d said Casse, who won the Preakness in 2019 with War of Will and has Sandman this year. \u201cThis is important. We want the best horses for our sport.\u201d",
      "When Asmussen won a Triple Crown race for the first time with Curlin in the 2007 Preakness, it came after his horse finished third behind Street Sense and Hard Spun in the Kentucky Derby. Curlin, Street Sense and Hard Spun went 1-2-3 in the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely running on a very different environment than we were then,\u201d Asmussen said. \u201cEvery horse is an individual, every year is different, and it\u2019s just very unique circumstances.\u201d",
      "The circumstances have deteriorated for the Preakness, on track and on television.",
      "Since pandemic crowd limits were lifted in 2022, attendance has plummeted by 62% from an average of nearly 120,000 from 2009-19 to just over 45,000 annually the past three renditions. NBC ratings have dropped 27.5% over that time from 6.9 million viewers to 5 million.",
      "Lukas, an 89-year-old Hall of Famer who has won the Preakness seven times, acknowledged not having the Derby winner in the field probably hurts for the \u201clay person that\u2019s not familiar with racing just saying, \u2018What\u2019s going on there?\u2019\u201d He said for the trainers, it still matters and that those paying attention year-round understand.",
      "But for a sport with an aging fan base that thrived in yesteryear when it was the only legalized form of sports gambling in many places, competition in that space has picked up and there are many options for younger sports fans beyond racing.",
      "A series of safety initiatives have been implemented to make the sport more acceptable to a wider audience. There has been significant progress on that front. Fatalities have decreased at tracks overseen by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, including to a historic low of 0.90 per 1,000 starts last year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got some momentum going right now,\u201d Casse said. \u201cOur game has come a long way in the last year or so. We were headed in the wrong direction. I feel like now we\u2019re headed in the right direction. Let\u2019s take advantage of this and make some changes.\u201d",
      "One thing that is not going to change is the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. Beyond that, plenty is up for consideration.",
      "Lukas has for decades pitched moving the Preakness back to Memorial Day weekend and the Belmont to the weekend closest to the Fourth of July. Prominent owner Mike Repole last week suggested making the Belmont the second leg and shifting the Preakness back to third to provide more time in between.",
      "Casse on Tuesday broached the option of a month between the races. Even four weeks apart would be more in line with modern thinking.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of us are going to say you want to give them four, five, six weeks between races,\u201d trainer Brendan Walsh said. \u201cA larger spacing between races would be more favorable to trainers. I think you would get better lineups in the individual races.\u201d",
      "Casse also wondered if bringing back a bonus for winning the Triple Crown would help or creating a points system and an incentive for running in all three races, especially if they\u2019re further apart.",
      "Since there is no centralized governing body dictating the calendar, changes would have to be agreed upon by the Maryland Jockey Club, which is taking over the Preakness from 1/ST Racing when Pimlico is scheduled to reopen in 2027, and the New York Racing Association that runs the Belmont.",
      "Baffert on Thursday said he hopes nothing changes, citing the excitement of American Pharoah completing the Triple Crown a decade ago.",
      "\u201cThe Triple Crown is still important, even though it\u2019s tough,\" Baffert said. \u201cWe need to keep this thing because this is what racing looks forward to.\u201d",
      "McCarthy, who has the Preakness favorite in Journalism after finishing second to Sovereignty in the Derby, is in Baffert\u2019s camp, saying: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a bit of a traditionalist in that way, but I think the three races in five weeks is good. I think it should stay as it is.\"",
      "Casse would have agreed a year ago but notes horses move around worldwide and are scrutinized for safety more than in previous generations.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that drives me more crazy than anything is when people say, \u2018Well, this is the way that we\u2019ve always done it,\u2019\u201d Casse said. \u201cI believe that the world gets smarter every day, and if you stand still, you get run over.\u201d",
      "Lukas points to alterations in recent years, including the Belmont shortening from its classic 1\u00bd-mile distance to 1\u00bc miles while temporarily at Saratoga Race Course, as support for change. With the Preakness moving to Laurel Park in 2026 and the Belmont returning to New York City after a short stay in Saratoga, he argues now is the time to redraw the schedule.",
      "But he also thinks whether to run a horse back in two weeks is part of the decision making that has been a hallmark of racing and trainers reading how their horses are doing.",
      "\"That horse makes the decision for you,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying attention, he\u2019ll tell you whether you want to come back in two weeks.\u201d",
      "The alternative is stakeholders taking the decision out of trainers' hands and coming up with something that keeps the Preakness and the Triple Crown relevant to casual fans and not just hardcore ones.",
      "\u201cIf you can come up with a plan and it makes sense and it can make everybody stronger, shouldn\u2019t it happen?\u201d Casse said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that should be worked on. As soon as this race is over this weekend, it should be worked on. That should be the next goal.\u201d",

      "In \u201cAmerican Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback,\u201d author and ESPN reporter Seth Wickersham describes how Williams and his father, Carl Williams, asked attorneys to find a workaround to the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, explored signing with the United Football League and considered publicly ripping Chicago and the Bears to create an untenable situation for the team.",
      "\u201cChicago is the place quarterbacks go to die,\u201d Carl Williams said ahead of the draft, according to the book.",
      "The book\u2019s account of the Williamses\u2019 pre-draft disdain for the Bears was reported by ESPN on Thursday.",
      "Caleb Williams indicated to confidantes he didn't think he could work with then-offensive coordinator Shane Waldron. Bears general manager Ryan Poles told Williams, \u201cWe\u2019re drafting you no matter what.\u201d",
      "Williams resigned himself to being drafted by the Bears, and after a pre-draft visit to the team facility, he believed he could help lead a turnaround.",

      "Mud balls are dominating the conversation at the PGA Championship",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The PGA Championship put the top three players in the world together for the first time in three years on Thursday and the conversation turned to mud.",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele each had clumps of mud on their golf balls from the middle of the 16th fairway \u2014 the hardest hole at Quail Hollow \u2014 and saw their shots curve hard to the left, over the green and into the water, leading to double bogeys.",
      "It was like that for most of the day, the product on a course that has been soaked by heavy showers in the three days leading up to the second major of the year, and more rain from late last week.",
      "The PGA of America put out a notice on the eve of the first round saying that the ball would be played as it lies because the turf was \u201coutstanding and drying by the hour.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are looking forward to an exciting opening round,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Maybe just not this variety.",
      "\u201cIt's frustrating to hit the ball in the middle of the fairway and get mud on it and have no idea where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d said Scheffler, the No. 1 player in golf the last two years. \"I understand it\u2019s part of the game, but there\u2019s nothing more frustrating for a player. You spend your whole life trying to learn how to control a golf ball, and due to a rules decision all of a sudden you have absolutely no control over where that golf ball goes.",
      "\u201cBut I don't make the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to deal with the consequences.\u201d",
      "He managed a 2-under 69, helped by twice holing shots from off the green \u2014 a chip-in from deep rough behind the 12th green (after another mud ball from the fairway), and putting in from just off the green at the par-5 15th for eagle.",
      "And then came the double bogey \u2014 by each player in the marquee group \u2014 on the 16th.",
      "\u201cI did a good job of battling back today and not letting a bad break like that \u2014 which cost me a couple shots \u2014 get to me,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cDid a good job battling after that and posting a decent score.\u201d",
      "Schauffele, the No. 3 player in the world and defending PGA champion, opened with a 1-over 72 and was leaning back in a leather chair in the locker room when he looked up and saw television replaying his shot on the 16th.",
      "He was aiming beyond the bunker right of the green and figures he probably should have been aiming toward where the gallery was watching.",
      "\u201cA lot of guys are dealing with it, but it's just unfortunate to be hitting good shots and to pay them off that way. It's kind of stupid,\u201d he said.",
      "McIlroy shot 74 and the Masters champion declined to speak to the media. He might not have been a good authority on mud balls because McIlroy was rarely in the fairway, hitting only four of them for the round.",
      "He also made double bogey on the 16th because of a different kind of conditions. McIlroy hit so far left that he was beyond the fairway down a grassy hill, the golf ball well above his shoes. As he tried to swing, his left foot spun out and he was lucky to make contact, advancing it some 30 yards, still in the rough.",
      "Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the world all made a 6.",
      "\u201cI kept the honor with making a double on a hole, and I think that will probably be the first and last time I do that in my career unless we get some crazy weather conditions,\u201d Scheffler said.",
      "That made him laugh. Little else did, particularly the decision to play the ball down. The U.S. Open never allows players to lift, clean and place the golf balls in the short grass. The PGA Championship did once during a rain-soaked weak at Baltusrol in 2016.",
      "Scheffler and Schauffele argued that Quail Hollow is pristine enough that cleaning mud off golf balls would not allow for a better lie than if it were dry.",
      "He said American courses \u2014 different from links golf for the British Open \u2014 are overseeded and lush and are bound to pick up mud, particularly when the sun returns after heavy rain.",
      "\u201cI understand how a golf purist would be, \u2018Oh, play it as it lies.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think they understand what it\u2019s like literally working your entire life to learn how to hit a golf ball and control it and hit shots and control distance, and all of a sudden due to a rules decision that is completely taken away from us by chance,\u201d Scheffler said.",
      "\u201cIn golf, there\u2019s enough luck throughout a 72-hole tournament that I don\u2019t think the story should be whether or not the ball is played up or down,\" he said. \u201cWhen I look at golf tournaments, I want the purest, fairest test of golf, and in my opinion maybe the ball today should have been played up.\u201d",
      "Schauffele disliked the idea of hitting the fairway and having a 50-50 chance at a good shot from there because of mud splotches. Toward the end of his round, he was happy to have mud on the top of his golf ball instead of the sides. Then it was only a matter of how it would affect distance instead of direction.",
      "And there was one other aspect to these mud balls. Schauffele glanced again at the television and saw Ryan Gerard at 7 under through 16 holes, before he bogeyed the last two for a 66.",
      "\u201cYes, it was frustrating, but everyone had it,\u201d Schauffele said. \u201cThere's a guy shooting 7 under right now. So clearly I'm just being a huge baby.\u201d",

      "The win streak is the fourth-longest in Twins history. The record is 15 straight in 1991. They had a 12-game winning streak last season. The Twins swept the season series 6-0 after being swept by the Orioles 6-0 last year.",
      "After the homers gave the Twins a 3-0 lead in the top of the third, center fielder Buxton and shortstop Carlos Correa collided while chasing a shallow fly ball that Buxton caught.

      "It took Tony Kanaan a dozen tries to win the Indianapolis 500, and, much later, four years to accept it was time to retire and find something else to do outside a racecar",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- It took Tony Kanaan a dozen tries to win the Indianapolis 500, and, much later, four years to accept it was time to retire and find something else to do outside a racecar.",
      "His 2023 start in the Indy 500 was supposed to be the last of his career and perhaps will ultimately go down as his final appearance in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d",
      "But that final 500 led to a full-time job with Arrow McLaren Racing, where in under two years Kanaan has been promoted to team principal and the man in charge of making the decisions while McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown focuses on Formula 1.",
      "And, in a worst case weather scenario May 25, Kanaan might just find himself back in the field of 33 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. After two days of rain delays, Kanaan on Thursday completed the veteran refresher course required for him to be the emergency replacement driver for Kyle Larson should Larson have to leave Indianapolis early to make it back to North Carolina for the the Coca-Cola 600.",
      "A long rain delay in Indy last year ruined Larson's attempt to complete motorsports 1,100-mile \u201cDouble\u201d and he never turned a lap in Charlotte. NASCAR made clear to Larson and Hendrick Motorsports that the Coca-Cola 600 must be his priority or it will cost him dearly in the Cup Series championship race.",
      "Although Kanaan said the refresher course rekindled his passion for Indianapolis, he would prefer not to replace Larson and race again at age 50. He'd have to start last if Larson leaves Indianapolis before the race begins.",
      "\u201cMy retirement, I think my biggest fear was how much I was going to miss this,\u201d Kanaan said. \u201cBut not sure I want to start 33rd and try to pass everybody and suffer for 2 1/2 hours. I did go out on my own terms and I don't have the need to go back and run this race again.\u201d",
      "Kanaan will be on Larson's timing stand during the race and cannot replace him in the car once the race begins.",
      "His acceptance of being a retired racer comes from the massive responsibility he's been given by Brown. With Brown based in England, Kanaan is the day-to-day boss at Arrow McLaren and thriving in the new role.",
      "\u201cThe team loves him, I haven't had that since I started the IndyCar team. He leads by example. He's a workaholic. He's motivated, and that rubs off on people,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"None of that surprises me. What did surprise me about TK is the dude can talk and listen at the same time. He takes a lot of advice, which is a bit unusual. He talks to our board members all the time \u2014 probably more than me \u2014 and he knows what he doesn't know and doesn't want to make mistakes, he's decisive, and he ain't scared.",
      "\u201cIf I tell him to do something \u2014 and it's something unpleasant \u2014 Tony's like \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do it.' Then 10 minutes later he calls me and tells me its done.\u201d",
      "Kanaan doesn't look at his new job as the guy tasked with doing Brown's dirty work \u2014 and there was a lot of it last year as the IndyCar team had a slew of driver hiring and firings.",
      "He said he understands the difficult business side of motorsports and noted Michael Andretti fired him in 2010 despite an existing contract over a loss of sponsorship. It was then he truly understood the brutal nature of the sport and has carried it with him into his role as leader at Arrow McLaren.",
      "\u201cI think the way I want to run the team, Zak and I think the same. It's not that he doesn't want to do it, it's that I'm in charge and I should do it,\u201d Kanaan said. \"If he's going to do everything for me, why am I here? When you\u2019re being honest, good or bad, it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cI had to do a few things these with people that were my friends,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. We run a company now. It\u2019s also my reputation and how I want this team to be perceived to be successful. If people are not able to separate the friendship to the professional, then too bad. I think it\u2019s just a choice that I made. I think I\u2019m a fair person. I think I try to run the team as fair as I can. If you\u2019re lacking, I will tell you. Or if you\u2019re doing good, I\u2019ll tell you. I will never forget, Zak told me one day, \u2018You don\u2019t need a title. If 10 people walk in the room, they should be able to pick who the boss is.\u2019\u201d",
      "Arrow McLaren fields three full-time entries for Pato O'Ward, Christian Lundgaard and Nolan Siegel, and a fourth car at Indy for Larson. O'Ward has embraced the feedback he receives from his new boss because Kanaan \"still thinks he\u2019s a racing driver.",
      "\u201cI think it drives everybody forward. Obviously, always has a good spirit, lots of energy,\u201d O'Ward said. \u201cI always like to hear the negative feedback more, I would say, than the positive because I feel like the positive, it\u2019s always very dependent on just results. But I feel like behind the results, there\u2019s a lot of things that happen, and you always learn more from the things that you\u2019re doing maybe not optimal. I always welcome it.\u201d",

      "Caitlin Clark's star power and the Indiana Fever\u2019s offseason moves to bolster an already competitive roster around her is drawing strong betting interest",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Caitlin Clark's star power and the Indiana Fever's offseason moves to bolster an already competitive roster around her is drawing strong betting interest.",
      "That was not exactly a revelation to BetMGM Sportsbook sports trader Hannah Luther.",
      "But to the level that money has come in on Clark and the Fever? Luther was surprised, but she gets it.",
      "\u201cThey're more of a top contender this year,\" she said. \u201cI think last season I didn't see the Fever as too much of a threat. We lowered our odds, but we were kind of happy to take money on them because we didn't really think they could beat the Liberty or the Lynx or the Aces, and I think this season we feel like there's a good possibility that they could.\u201d",
      "Luther said Clark was probably a top-five player at the end of her rookie season last year, and the Fever also had notable players such as Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell on a team that made the playoffs. Then in the offseason, the Fever signed DeWanna Bonner and Natasha Howard and hired Stephanie White as coach and Amber Cox as general manager.",
      "The Fever are +300 at BetMGM to win the WNBA championship, behind defending champion New York at +225 and Las Vegas at +275. Minnesota, at +400, is the other notable contender.",
      "The Liberty (+225) also are the favorites at DraftKings Sportsbook, with the Fever, Aces and Lynx next at +370 each.",
      "\u201cThey're a lot better team,\u201d DraftKings race and sports operations director Johnny Avello said of the Fever. \u201cWe had them, I think, 100-1 to win it all opening last season. They took a lot of money. This year, they're taking a lot of money again. That's the one team that most people are interested in.\u201d",
      "Dana Lane, handicapper for PickDawgz.com, is bullish on Indiana, saying he believes the Fever will play the Lynx in the WNBA Finals.",
      "\u201cMinnesota's absolutely loaded,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI think this is the year where Indiana takes that massive step forward. Now, is it too big of a step? We're going to find that out, but they're going to make a lot of noise for sure.\u201d",
      "The Aces repeated just two seasons ago, but for Lane, that's the exception rather than the rule for a reason.",
      "They were the first team to go back-to-back in 21 years.",
      "New York has that chance this season to join the Aces and figures to at least be in the conversation with another loaded roster led by Breanna Stewart, who has won the MVP award twice.",
      "\u201cI always try to shy away from teams that won the title the year before,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI just always feel like there\u2019s the element of not being as hungry.\u201d",
      "Avello probably isn't alone among oddsmakers who would prefer a team other than the Fever to hoist the trophy at the end of the season.",
      "He said there is money coming in on Phoenix, Seattle and Dallas because bettors see value in those teams' longer odds. But even the favorites outside of Indiana would be good news for the sportsbook if one of those teams won it all.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the whole picture, the Fever\u2019s like our only loser,\u201d Avello said. \u201cEverybody else is good for us, so we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d",
      "If there is heavy betting on the Fever to win it all, there certainly is a ton on Clark to capture league MVP. Last season's Rookie of the Year is the +195 favorite at BetMGM to unseat Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson as MVP, but just barely. Wilson is +200.",
      "\u201cShe does bring a lot of (betting) action to the Fever,\u201d Luther said of Clark. \u201cA lot of our top games last season were Fever games, but we have pretty substantial growth across all teams and all matchups, which is pretty encouraging. If something were to happen to her or people start to lose interest in her, we think there's interest in the league overall as well.\u201d",
      "Wilson is the +200 favorite at DraftKings to win MVP, ahead of Clark at +235. Wilson is not only the reigning MVP, it\u2019s an award she has won three times.",
      "UConn's Paige Bueckers, drafted first overall by Dallas, is the runaway choice for Rookie of the Year, listed at BetMGM at -350. The next closest is Seattle's Dominique Malonga at +450.",

      "And then in a span of about 20 hours, the North Carolina native went from first alternate to a 4-under 67 that kept his name around the top of the leaderboard Thursday.",
      "\u201cI really prepared just like any other week,\u201d Smalley said. \u201cObviously, it's interesting being first alternate. I was losing hope after every passing hour. And you know, you hear about everybody's ailments being first alternate.\u201d",
      "In this case it was Sahith Theegala who had to withdraw during the Truist Championship last week at Philadelphia Cricket Club. And his neck injury never got better for the Californian to play the PGA Championship, a major he finished in the top 15 a year ago. So he was out.",
      "Smalley was in.",
      "He had three birdies in a four-hole stretch on the back nine (after starting on No. 10), dropped a pair of shots on tough par 4s on the front nine and then shot his way back into the mix by holing a 70-foot putt across the green on the par-5 seventh for eagle.",
      "Smalley made a short birdie putt on the short par-4 eighth, managed par on the brutal par-4 ninth hole and had his lowest score in his third appearance at the PGA Championship.",
      "He felt bad for Theegala, but only to a point.",
      "\u201cI wish him the best and hope to have him back out here as quick as possible because us players and I know the fans really like him a lot,\u201d Smalley said. \u201cIt was a shame to see him not be able to play this week. But it was nice to get an opportunity to play.\u201d",
      "Smalley already had one close call getting into Quail Hollow. The PGA Championship takes all PGA Tour winners, and Smalley was two shots out of the lead on the back nine at the Myrtle Beach Classic on Sunday. He didn't make up ground, but there was still hope.",
      "The PGA Championship kept a spot open in case the Myrtle Beach winner had already qualified for Quail Hollow. The tournament came down to Ryan Fox, Mackenzie Hughes and Harry Higgs. Hughes was already in the PGA, so if he won then Smalley would be in as first alternate.",
      "Hughes made bogey on the last hole and Fox won the playoff. Smalley was still an alternate.",
      "Smalley drove home to Greensboro and didn't bother coming over until Monday night. And then he treated it like any other tournament, playing nine holes when he could because of rain, practice, another nine holes Wednesday morning, more waiting and hoping.",
      "What helped make it feel normal was getting notice on Wednesday afternoon. Otherwise, he would have had to be around the practice area from 7 a.m. until 2:37 p.m., the last tee time.",
      "The PGA Championship alternates come off a special PGA Tour money list. Smalley was the fifth alternate when the field was announced last week.",
      "Unlike other majors that have an alternate list, this group typically is PGA Tour players capable of hanging with the best. John Daly famously won the 1991 PGA Championship as the ninth alternate in his rookie season on the PGA Tour.",
      "Smalley has been first alternate a few times on the PGA Tour, getting the call predawn of the opening rounds.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019ve had decent luck at first alternate before, but I don\u2019t really want to be in that position anymore,\u201d he said.",

      "All three walked off the green separately, dejected and eager to hit the reset button.",
      "McIlroy seemed destined for trouble from the start after the Masters champion hooked his tee shot to the left and watched in disbelief as his ball rolled down a steep embankment, stopping in the deep rough a few yards from the water that runs along the left side of the fairway. That left McIlroy with an awkward stance on a muddy sidehill that had endured two days of heavy rains this week.",
      "As McIlroy attempted to strike the ball, his back foot slipped and he was lucky just to make contact with the ball, which fluttered some 65 yards ahead and landed in some shorter rough.

      "Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have been teammates for 12 seasons. If that's going to continue after this year, it'll evidently mean they're both staying with Inter Miami.",
      "Alba has signed a contract extension with Inter Miami, one that has him committed to be with the Major League Soccer club through the end of the 2027 season. He played alongside Messi for nine seasons with Barcelona and they're in their third season together with Inter Miami \u2014 both arriving during the team's 2023 campaign.",
      "Messi has an option for next season \u2014 when Inter Miami plans to move into its new, long-awaited stadium near Miami International Airport \u2014 and the sides have been working on a deal for some time, but no official commitment has been announced yet.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to renew my contract because I have the desire to continue competing, and because of how I feel at the club, with the affection I receive from fans at every match. I\u2019ve been very comfortable these past two years at the club, and I feel very loved by all the fans,\u201d Alba said. \u201cWe have that desire to continue competing, to continue winning, and, hopefully, win as many titles as possible.\u201d",
      "Alba, a left back, had five goals and 15 assists while earning an All-Star selection during the MLS season a year ago, including playoffs. He helped Inter Miami win the Supporters\u2019 Shield and break the MLS single-season points record by a team.",
      "The 36-year-old Alba came to Inter Miami not long after Messi announced he was headed there in June 2023. Messi's arrival led to Sergio Busquets, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Alba \u2014 all teammates in Barcelona \u2014 joining MLS.",
      "Alba helped Barcelona win six La Liga titles, five Copa del Rey trophies and the Champions League in 2015.",

    "story": [
      "Since the game\u2019s early days, baseball mythology has been constructed \u2014 often deliberately \u2014 to set itself apart",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The legends of pastoral fields. The detailed history and meticulous attention to continuity. The sight of kids playing ball. The hush that descends when you walk into the Hall of Fame. Each implicitly casts the universe of baseball as a magical land that touches, but maybe isn't precisely part of, the \u201creal\u201d world in which we live. \u201cThe whole history of baseball,\u201d the writer Bernard Malamud once said, \u201chas the quality of mythology.\u201d",
      "Since the game's early days, that mythology has been constructed \u2014 often deliberately \u2014 to set itself apart. But sometimes things happen that demonstrate otherwise, and reality pokes through.",
      "One of those things unfolded this week when Commissioner Rob Manfred decided that permanent bans from baseball expire upon the death of the banned player. In a single moment, he changed the possible posthumous career trajectory of two preposterously talented ballplayers \u2014 Pete Rose and \u201cShoeless Joe\u201d Jackson, one banned for decades for gambling on baseball, the other for more than a century for abetting gamblers. Each is now eligible for the Hall of Fame.",
      "Some welcomed it. \u201cA great day for baseball,\u201d said Rose's Philadelphia Phillies teammate, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt. Others chose the online equivalent of spitting disgustedly on the ground. \"A very dark day for baseball,\" said Marcus Giamatti, son of the late baseball commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who banned Rose in 1989. On social media, many wondered whether Manfred had responded to President Donald Trump's stated desire that Rose be reinstated.",
      "The reality, though, is this: No matter what you think of Manfred's decision, baseball and the larger world around it collide far more often than the purists might wish \u2014 and have since the game's early decades.",
      "A national pastime can hardly avoid reflecting the values of the culture it serves. That means two things.",
      "\u2014 First, American society is built on stories. Where other civilizations have hundreds or thousands of years of common culture behind their nationhood, Americans willed their republic into existence on stories like the \u201cshining city upon a hill,\u201d \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d \u201call men are created equal.\u201d Then they built it out with tales of the frontier and erected industrial story factories like Hollywood and Madison Avenue. Isn't it natural, then, that the game many think helped define America would be built on some tall tales, too?",
      "\u2014 But second, this is a land of messy politics and jockeying for power and money and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 the silencing of less powerful groups. Who could expect a national pastime, however mythic its public-facing ambitions, not to interact with \u2014 and be affected by \u2014 the society in which it operates?",
      "That meant sharp-elbowed business machinations in the late 19th century that saw the rise and fall of an entirely new league in the course of a single season \u2014 and player-contract actions in its wake that led to criticism of the Pittsburgh Alleghenies as \u201cpiratical,\u201d inspiring a team nickname that has endured to this day.",
      "It meant the mob-backed, gambling-fueled \u201cthrowing\u201d of the 1919 World Series by several Chicago White Sox players \u2014 a group henceforth known as the \u201cBlack Sox\u201d \u2014 that led to the appointment of the first baseball commissioner, a man with the unlikely name of Kenesaw Mountain Landis. He almost immediately banned those accused of involvement from the game, including \u201cShoeless Joe,\" who was remythologized in the 1989 film \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d As of this week, Jackson has been reinstated \u2014 74 years after his death.",
      "It meant a game that reflected the racism of the nation around it, which kept Black men out until Jackie Robinson famously broke the color barrier in 1947. And it meant a policy on free agency that stacked the deck in favor of owners until a center fielder named Curt Flood, another Black man, took exception to it and took action, sending his name echoing across courtrooms and even Congress after saying: \"I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold.\"",
      "It meant no less than nine lockouts or strikes over the past six decades \u2014 underscoring that baseball, like many other American institutions, is not insulated from labor unrest. It meant cocaine scandals and PED scandals and sign-stealing scandals. Reckoning a century-plus of anxiety about the game's integrity with a suddenly betting-obsessed sports landscape foisted on baseball by a Supreme Court ruling. Arguments in zoning hearing boards, planning commissions, economic development conferences and city councils over new stadiums, bond issues, local referendums and attempts to figure out precisely where baseball teams fit into their communities.",
      "Politics even figured in attempts during the early 20th century to figure out where baseball came from.",
      "The Mills Commission, assembled in 1905 to suss out the game's origins, found itself confronted with two competing narratives: In one, put forth by baseball pioneer Henry Chadwick, the game evolved from something English. In the other \u2014 a convenient American narrative if there ever was one \u2014 a man named Abner Doubleday laid out a diamond in 1839 on a cow pasture in upstate New York, and baseball was born.",
      "The bucolic Doubleday narrative, endorsed by the commission and by baseball itself, flourished for decades. It was debunked long ago in favor of more diffuse origins, which is how history usually actually unfolds.",
      "But the legend's power pushed it into the national conversation to the point that the place where Doubleday purportedly invented the game became not only the home to the Hall of Fame but a metaphor for greatness, baseball and otherwise: Cooperstown.",
      "None of this should surprise us. Ultimately, baseball is a lively collage of American life \u2014 a game, a business, a political arena, a form of professional entertainment. It has been a repository of a rising nation's big dreams, of children's hero worship, of teenagers' ambitions and old men's laments.",
      "\u201cBaseball is play, not work \u2014 even when played by professionals, for whom it is indeed work \u2014 and so stands aside from the normal conduct of everyday life: business, economy, government,\u201d John Thorn, Major League Baseball\u2019s official historian, said Wednesday.",
      "It certainly tries. On Wednesday night, Cincinnati \u2014 the team with which Rose is most associated in a city where his mythology never flagged \u2014 honored him. People posed in front of a statue of him. The word \u201clegend\u201d was tossed around. In a twist worthy of a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode, Rose's old team happened to be playing the Chicago White Sox \u2014 Jackson's old team.",
      "Many fans go to ballparks to escape the world. My late father, a Cleveland fan born in 1922 three years after the Black Sox scandal, used to say in his older years that the Indians\u2019 old stomping ground, League Park, where he used to go as a boy, was \u201ca refuge from the things I worried about.\u201d",
      "At every pro baseball game, all of the calibrated trappings make one thing easy to conclude: The game thinks of itself as pure and wants others to think that too. Sometimes, though, the magic is in the blemishes. Each time the real world intrudes on baseball, many argue that the game emerges stronger \u2014 even as it struggles to stay relevant in a 21st-century marketplace of sports and entertainment.",
      "And as it grows harder and harder for baseball \u2014 for anything, really \u2014 to be insulated from the reality of the world, myths have a tougher time taking hold. In that vein, we'll leave the final words to Pete Rose himself, from an interview in 2014 \u2014 a rejection of mythology from a ballplayer long enveloped in myth.",
      "\"When guys do books or stories,\" he said, \"all I like to see is the truth.\"",

      "The Minnesota Timberwolves are in the Western Conference finals for the second straight year",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The staff had a simple question for the players who helped the Minnesota Timberwolves make their deep run last year.",
      "\u201cWere you a Western Conference finals team, or were you a team that just happened to make the Western Conference finals?\u201d coach Chris Finch said, recalling the preseason conversation. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only one way to prove that: Go out and do it again. And that was our mission all year.\"",
      "The Timberwolves filled in that blank by beating the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors in five games in each of their first two series in these NBA playoffs, finalizing their return to the penultimate round where they lost last season to the Dallas Mavericks.",
      "The roster from that five-game defeat underwent a surprisingly significant change, layering the challenge of new-player adjustment on top of an already difficult task of matching or bettering such a strong postseason run.",
      "Right before training camp began, the Wolves traded franchise cornerstone Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for Julius Randle to take his place at power forward and in the sidekick role to Anthony Edwards. They got Donte DiVincenzo in the deal for defense and shooting off the bench, too.",
      "Randle looked out of sorts at times during the first couple of months, and coinciding midseason injuries for him, DiVincenzo and Rudy Gobert further hampered progress on the court and in the standings. Losing 117-116 on Feb. 28 to a Utah team that finished last in the league left the Wolves at 32-29, staring the play-in games straight in the face with the West stacked again with more competitive teams than there were spots in the playoffs.",
      "But the three of them got healthy again, and the Wolves took off in March.",
      "\u201cHaving the mental toughness and determination to say we\u2019re going to figure this thing out, because all of us, as a whole, believed how good we could be as a team,\u201d said Randle, who had 29 points in the Game 5 win over Golden State on Wednesday night. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of everybody.\u201d",
      "The Wolves will play the Denver-Oklahoma City winner. They could get five days off, if the Nuggets beat the Thunder on Thursday to force a Game 7 in the other West semifinal series. If the Thunder win, they'll host Game 1 on Sunday, still a three-day break for the Wolves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be good to get a chance to take a breath and regroup and figure out where we\u2019re going,\u201d said Finch, whose team is 10-3 on the road over the 2024 and 2025 playoffs.",
      "Finch is by far the most successful coach in the history of these star-crossed Timberwolves, who've had only three of their 14 coaches even make the playoffs. They've made it in each of his four full seasons and now reached back-to-back conference finals for the first time in franchise history.",
      "Who knows where this run will finish? But with No. 1 seed Cleveland out and No. 2 seed Boston on the brink of elimination in the East with star Jayson Tatum sidelined by injury, plus the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds long gone from the West bracket, the Wolves have given themselves as good of a chance as anyone to win their first title.",
      "\u201cEvery team goes through a lot. Everyone wants to rush the process. Everybody wants everything to be great, compared to what you\u2019ve done in the past. All that\u2019s kind of irrelevant really when you have a new team coming in to the season,\u201d Finch said.",
      "Veterans typically embrace and understand the urgency to win, with the realization that championship windows don't stay open as long as they seemingly should. Fittingly for the Wolves, their three 30-something players in the rotation led the way in the close-out win over the Warriors.",
      "Randle shot 13 for 18, with eight rebounds and five assists. Rudy Gobert had 17 points and eight rebounds, with a plus-21 rating. Mike Conley had 16 points and eight assists.",
      "\u201cWe went through a lot of growing pains,\u201d Finch said, \"but the team has come together at the right time and is playing its best basketball.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "One would think the job of making the NFL schedule has got somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture",
      "NBC Sports president Rick Cordella put it best when summarizing what the NFL's scheduling department goes through each year.",
      "\u201cI have five kids at home and you never satisfy them all. Just try and do your best, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d Cordella said Wednesday afternoon after he had a chance to look at the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d slate for the upcoming season. \u201cThey have really, really hard jobs. I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

Yaw Yeboah ended the scoring six minutes later nearly duplicating Bouanga's goal from the same spot.",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him",
      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years.

      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (formerly Marie Stopes), part of a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored, an organization cofounded by Dimitratou, has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to change some of its internal policies.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "What Biden's rule did \"was send a message to 120 nations that they couldn\u2019t necessarily count on us to provide the AI they want and need,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, at a U.S. Senate hearing last week.",
      "Commerce Undersecretary Jeffery Kessler said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration will work to replace the now-rescinded rule to pursue AI with \"trusted foreign countries around the world, while keeping the technology out of the hands of our adversaries.\" The administration said a replacement rule is coming in the future but hasn't said what the new rule will say.",
      "The European Commission welcomed the change, said spokesperson Thomas Regnier, arguing that the Biden rule, if it took effect, would \"undermine U.S. diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.\u201d",
      "European Union countries should be able to buy advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations, Regnier said.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",

      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "Google will pay $1.4 billion to Texas to settle claims the company collected users' data without permission, the state\u2019s attorney general announced Friday.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton described the settlement as sending a message to tech companies that he will not allow them to make money off of \u201cselling away our rights and freedoms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law.\" Paxton said in a statement. \u201cFor years, Google secretly tracked people\u2019s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.\u201d",
      "The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches and biometric data. The state argued Google was \u201cunlawfully tracking and collecting users\u2019 private data.\u201d",
      "Paxton claimed, for example, that Google collected millions of biometric identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through such products and services as Google Photos and Google Assistant.",
      "Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda said the agreement settles an array of \u201cold claims,\u201d some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The company also clarified that the settlement does not require any new product changes.",
      "Paxton said the $1.4 billion is the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over this type of data-privacy violations.",
      "Texas previously reached two other key settlements with Google within the last two years, including one in December 2023 in which the company agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store.",
      "Meta has also agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit over allegations that the tech giant used users' biometric data without their permission.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers cross-examined Diddy's ex for six hours on Thursday.",
      "After two days of testimony about how her relationship with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs grew violent and coercive, Cassie Ventura faced six hours of grueling cross-examination on Thursday, as defense attorneys attempted to cast doubt on her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities.",
      "Defense attorneys turned to a decade of archived text messages to question Ventura about the consistency of her earlier testimony, highlighting her apparent eagerness to engage in Combs' lifestyle of swinging at drug-fueled orgies. They insist that she was not a victim of sex trafficking or racketeering and that Combs is innocent of the federal charges he's facing.",
      "During other portions of the cross-examination, Combs' attorney Anna Estevao appeared to use seemingly mundane messages \u2013 like planning dates or expressing their romantic feelings to one another \u2013 as an opportunity to humanize Combs, who occasionally nodded his head as his lawyers questioned Ventura.",
      "Combs' lawyers have argued that, while he has made mistakes, engaged in domestic violence and abused drugs, he never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. Seated next to his lawyers, Combs appeared engaged in the cross-examination and at one point signaled a heart with his hands toward the wife of his main defense attorney, a former prosecutor whose clients now include alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione, who has entered a not guilty plea.",
      "Ventura's testimony as the star witness for the prosecution is expected to conclude tomorrow, given concerns that the singer, now eight months pregnant, could go into labor as early as this weekend.",
      "Defense lawyers use text messages to show mutual affection between Combs and Ventura",
      "Ventura openly acknowledged in both her direct and cross-examinations that she loved Combs for more than a decade and hoped to build a life with him. She told jurors she fell in love with Combs shortly after they met, and jurors saw messages from the start of their relationship.",
      "\"We've only really had one week of each other just together and I can say that it's been the best and worst,\" Ventura wrote in 2007. \"I'm sad, mad, frustrated and hurt that you just don't feel like I'm the right one.\"",
      "Jurors also saw messages from August 2009, when the couple first went public with their relationship, and other messages from more than two years into their relationship.",
      "\"I love you so much it consumes my life,\" she wrote in April 2010.",
      "Ventura testified that while the messages appeared positive, she began to see a different side of Combs as they spent more time together \u2013 one that she said was prone to violence, jealousy and rage.",
      "\"The more time I spent with him and got to know him, his real personality -- or at least what I thought was his real personality -- came out,\" Ventura testified.",
      "Defense lawyers press Ventura about apparent willingness to engage in freak-offs",
      "During her direct examination, Ventura acknowledged she first agreed to participate in a freak-off to make Combs happy by indulging in his sexual fantasy. She said she quickly realized she did not enjoy the drug-fueled orgies that could go on for days and included her having sexual encounters with prostitutes and strangers.",
      "To counter Ventura's assertion she was coerced to plan and participate in freak-offs, defense attorneys presented a series of messages apparently showing a different attitude. \"I'm always ready to freak off,\" she wrote in August 2009.",
      "Jurors also saw text messages that suggested Combs expressed interest in Ventura's desires, though she had previously testified those did not matter to Combs. The messages also seem to show she attempted to please Combs by preparing for the freak-offs, including by visiting a sex shop in advance of an orgy.",
      "\"Trying to find something to impress you,\" she wrote in one message. At least one of the jurors raised his eyebrows as an explicit message was shown in court.",
      "Defense attorneys pressed Ventura about her reasons for being reluctant to engage in freak-offs, suggesting she was frustrated not by the violence or coercion but rather because she wanted more from the relationship.",
      "\"When we used to freak off when were so in love. There were no questions asked, it felt right, like it literally made sense for the next step in our sex life together. I get nervous that I'm just becoming the girlfriend that you get your fantasies off with and that's it. I don't get the other part,\" Ventura wrote in a message to Combs from December 2009.",
      "During her first two days of testimony, Ventura testified at length about a 2016 episode when she said she tried to leave a freak-off but was attacked by Combs \u2013 an assault that was captured on surveillance video and shown to jurors. On cross-examination, Ventura was shown text messages that suggested she was eager to participate in the freak-off, and Combs' violence might have been influenced by his drug use.",
      "\"The drugs that you and Mr. Combs took that day were a bad batch of MDMA, right?\" Estevao said.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Ventura asked.",
      "Defense attorneys suggest relationship was defined by mutual jealousy",
      "Defense attorneys pressed Ventura about the flaws in her relationship with Combs, arguing the jealousy and infidelity went both ways for the couple.",
      "Ventura admitted she \"had some jealousy\" of Kim Porter, the late mother of four of Combs' children, and was upset when Combs continued a relationship with another woman.",
      "\"It was disappointing and hurtful to find out you weren't the main girlfriend?\" Estevao asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ventura replied. \"It didn't pertain to every situation, but I was definitely jealous of certain situations he was in.\"",
      "Jurors were shown text messages showing Combs and Ventura expressing anger about each other's infidelity, with Combs seeing another woman while Ventura was in a relationship with actor Michael B. Jordan. Ventura was asked about her relationship with Kid Cudi \u2013 whose real name is Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, and who she previously testified she stopped seeing because of tension with Combs \u2013 and how she said Combs \"lunged\" at her when he discovered their relationship during a freak-off.",
      "\"Did you feel justified in cheating on him with Mr. Mescudi because of Mr. Combs' infidelity?\" Estevao asked.",
      "\"I could have, I don't know,\" she answered.",

    "story": [
      "The justices on Thursday considered the legality of nationwide injunctions.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday heard oral arguments over President Donald Trump's emergency request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The rare May sitting of the court sets the stage for a decision by this summer on whether Trump can move forward with plans to limit U.S. citizenship only to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents.",
      "The case is also expected to address the legality of individual district court judges single-handedly blocking a presidential policy nationwide. Trump is seeking to dissolve judicial orders preventing mass federal layoffs, funding freezes, and expedited deportation protocols.",
      "For more than a century, courts and the government have interpreted the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause to apply to anyone born in the U.S., regardless of the citizenship status of a child's parents.",
      "The Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, states that all \"persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer kicked off the first Supreme Court oral argument over Trump's second-term policies by arguing that the ability of one district judge to issue a nationwide order creates a fundamentally unfair legal playing field for the government.",
      "\"Our primary contention is that the citizenship clause related to the children of former slaves, not to illegal aliens who weren't even present as a discrete class at that time,\" he told the justices.",
      "Sauer said that national injunctions force district judges to rush their \"high stakes, low information decisions,\" encourage forum shopping, and prevent the \"percolation of novel and difficult legal questions.\"",
      "\"They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere, while the plaintiffs can win anywhere,\" said Sauer, who last year argued on behalf of Trump in a personal capacity to push for presidential immunity.",
      "His claim was immediately met with skepticism from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who suggested that such a theory would not only limit the ability of the district court but also the Supreme Court from issuing nationwide relief.",
      "\"That makes no sense whatsoever,\" she said before making an analogy to when the balance of power shifts in Washington.",
      "\"When a new president orders that because there's so much gun violence going on in the country, and he comes in and he says, 'I have the right to take away the guns from everyone,' and he sends out the military to seize everyone's guns. We and the courts have to sit back and wait until every name plaintiff gets or every plaintiff whose gun is taken comes into court?\" she asked.",
      "On the issue of the legality of Trump's executive order to limit U.S. citizenship only to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents, Sotomayor was clear on where she stood. The order, she said, was unlawful.",
      "\"As far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents, and you are claiming that\u2026both the Supreme Court and no lower court can stop an executive from universally violating those holdings by this court,\" Sotomayor said.",
      "Both Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett pressed Sauer in a series of exchanges over whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could create a situation where unlawful executive orders are in place for too long a time before the Supreme Court can weigh in to rule on their legality.",
      "\"General Sauer, are you really going to answer Justice Kagan by saying there're no way to [stop the EO nationwide] expeditiously?\" Barrett asked.",
      "Sauer answered stating that using the normal process of the courts and applying clear cut Supreme Court precedent could ultimately settle such issues quickly.",
      "The exchange came as Justice Kagan questioned whether the impact of abolishing nationwide injunctions would effectively inject more chaos in the court system by requiring individual plaintiffs -- like those subject to having their citizenship revoked by Trump's birthright executive order -- to file piecemeal lawsuits in courts across the country.",
      "Sotomayor also pushed back against Sauer's arguments that the Supreme Court would benefit from the \"percolation\" of lower courts issuing opinions that would help the high court decide weighty issues over actions taken by the administration.",
      "\"We have most \u2026 courts who've percolated this issue and said, 'You're violating precedent, not only precedent, but the plain meaning of the 14th [Amendment] of the Constitution,\" she said.",
      "\"Respectfully, I think what we have are lower courts making snap judgments on the merits that ignore the fundamental principle of the 14th amendment -- that it was about giving citizenship to the children of slaves, not to the children of illegal immigrants,\" Sauer answered.",
      "But some of the justices suggested that the impact of limiting nationwide injunctions might be bearable. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the Supreme Court has gotten better at hearing cases \"much more expeditiously,\" referencing how a legal challenge related to TikTok made its way through the court in a matter of months.",
      "\"We survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions,\" Justice Clarence Thomas added.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised concerns that preventing federal judges from issuing nationwide orders would essentially create a \"Catch Me If You Can\" system of justice in which individual citizens can only protect their rights if they have the resources to file lawsuits.",
      "\"I don't understand how that is remotely consistent with the rule of law,\" she said.",
      "Sauer argued that current system of nationwide injunction instead forces the Trump administration to race from court to court to win every case challenging their policies, citing the flurry of lawsuits and injunctions blocking the Pentagon's transgender service member ban.",
      "\"I think the 'Catch Me If You Can' problem operates in the opposite direction, where we have the government racing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction having to sort of clear the table in order to implement a new policy,\" he said.",
      "The justice system, he argued, should work more slowly and allow the \"percolation\" of novel legal issues rather than rush to judgement, but Jackson pushed back, saying that delays could enable the enforcement of unlawful policies.",
      "\"If the government is saying no lower court can completely enjoin it, it actually means that the government just keeps on doing the purportedly unlawful thing, and it delays the ability for this court to reach the underlying issue,\" she said.",
      "Kelsi Corkran, a senior lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center who was representing the individual plaintiffs, called the president's executive order on birthright citizenship \"blatantly unlawful\" and should be blocked because it violates the Constitution, federal law, and Supreme Court precedent.",
      "\"The government is wrong,\" she said. \"It is well settled that preliminary injunctions may benefit nonparties when necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs or when warranted by extraordinary circumstances, both of which are true here.\"",
      "Corkran argued that the nationwide orders should be allowed in issues involving \"fundamental constitutional rights.\" Barring the legal relief outright, she said, would allow individuals to be irreparably harmed.\"It's a lose, lose, lose proposal that the government is offering,\" Corkran said.",
      "Kagan suggested that the middle-ground approaches are unlikely to resolve the issue, though she acknowledged that the issue of nationwide injunctions has irritated presidents from both sides of the aisle and the high court.",
      "\"What's problematic about it is that the courts keep deciding the same way, and nobody really thinks that the lower courts are going to do anything different,\" she said.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order unilaterally declaring that only newborns whose parents have permanent legal status are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the U.S. and therefore eligible to be citizens.",
      "\"This administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained during a February briefing.",
      "Three different sets of plaintiffs sued to block the order, including a group of 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups, and pregnant women whose soon-to-be-born children would be affected.",
      "\"Birthright citizenship is at the core of our Nation's foundational precept that all people born on our soil are created equal, regardless of their parentage,\" attorneys for the immigrant advocates wrote in legal briefs.",
      "An estimated 150,000 children are born each year in the U.S. to parents who are not legal permanent residents, according to government data.",
      "\"Instead of the right to full participation and belonging in their home country -- the United States -- these children will be forced to live in the shadow,\" the states warned in court filings, \"under the constant risk of deportation while the appeals run their course.\"",
      "Federal judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state -- and three federal appeals court panels -- have issued nationwide injunctions keeping the Trump policy on hold during litigation, concluding that it very likely violates the Constitution and high court precedent.",
      "\"I have been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the case presented is as clear as it is here,\" said Judge John Coughenour of the Western District of Washington during a January hearing in the case. \"This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.\"",
      "In 1898, the Supreme Court directly addressed the question of citizenship for children born to non-citizens on U.S. soil, ruling in the landmark case U.S. v Wong Kim Ark that they are Americans under the law.",
      "\"The [14th] Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States,\" wrote Justice Horace Gray for the 6-2 majority. \"Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\"",
      "The issue arrives back at the high court in an unusual posture.",
      "Neither side has briefed the justices on the constitutionality of the executive order. Instead, the primary dispute is over the scope of injunctions issued by individual district court judges.",
      "\"It focuses only on whether it is appropriate for courts to issue nationwide injunctions against the President's egregiously unconstitutional executive order, as opposed to remedies limited to people directly involved in the litigation or those living in states that have sued the government,\" said Ilya Somin, a constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute.",
      "The Trump administration has complained that judges should only be allowed to block a contested policy insofar as it impacts the actual plaintiffs who brought the case -- not block it universally.",
      "\"Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" acting solicitor general Sarah Harris wrote in the government's application to the court.",
      "Many of the administration's high-profile attempts to reshape the federal government, sharply curtail federal spending, transform immigration policy, and limit protections for LGBTQ people have been blocked by nationwide injunctions issued by district courts.",
      "Justice Department attorneys from administrations of both political parties have long complained about the overuse of nationwide injunctions and alleged incursion on executive branch power. The court may use this case to articulate parameters for when such sweeping injunctions are warranted and when they are not.",
      "\"This Court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" Harris said, calling on the justices to narrow the injunctions applied to the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Immigrant advocates, civil rights organizations, and Democratic state attorneys general have warned that blocking Trump's birthright citizenship in some places but not others -- or, exempting a small group of plaintiffs but not others -- would create chaos.",
      "\"A situation where Trump's order is in force for some people, but not others (or, alternatively, in some states but not others), creates obvious confusion and anomalies,\" he said, \"especially when it comes to a policy (citizenship rules) that is supposed to be uniform throughout the nation.\"",
      "Some legal scholars say it may be impossible for the court to address the question of nationwide injunctions without also resolving the underlying dispute over Trump's attempt to redefine birthright citizenship.",
      "\"They're going to have to address the whole thing,\" said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law. \"The only way to avoid the scope of the injunction question is to rule on the merits. I believe they're going to rule against Trump. He gets maybe one or two votes but not much more than that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anna Maciejewska, a 43-year-old Poland native, left behind her 4-year-old son.",
      "A Pennsylvania man has been arrested for allegedly killing his wife who vanished in 2017, prosecutors said.",
      "Anna Maciejewska, a Poland native, moved to the U.S. in 1997 and married Allen Gould in 2006, according to the criminal complaint. The couple's son was 4 years old when she disappeared.",
      "On April 11, 2017, Maciejewska, 43, was reported missing by a co-worker and a friend; the next day, Gould also reported her missing, the Chester County District Attorney's Office said Wednesday.",
      "But evidence including phone records, financial records and witness accounts point to Maciejewska stopping her normal routine on March 29, and the last time anyone saw her or heard from her was March 28, prosecutors said.",
      "On March 30, Maciejewska\u2019s dad in Poland received a text from his daughter's phone with a birthday message in Polish that had grammatical errors, prosecutors said. \"Police later determined the same message was researched via Google Translate, despite that Maciejewska spoke Polish fluently,\" prosecutors said in a statement.",
      "A printout of that same Google Translate message was found in Gould\u2019s home, according to the criminal complaint.",
      "Gould told police he last saw his wife on the morning of April 10 when she left for work, but her car's internal system showed it was never driven that day, according to the criminal complaint. Maciejewska\u2019s car was discovered in May in an apartment complex parking lot nearly 2 miles from their home, the complaint said.",
      "When officers responded to their home for the missing persons report, they noticed Maciejewska\u2019s iPhone and iPad were on the kitchen table and her phone was \"in a startup/update status, as if it had been reset,\" according to the criminal complaint. Gould allegedly told police his wife was updating her phone on the morning she went missing but it was taking too long to finish updating so she left it at home when she rushed out the door to work, the document said. All of her belongings were left at home besides the keys to her car, the document said.",
      "Officers found divorce paperwork at the couple's home, the complaint said, and Maciejewska was taking a \"Divorce 101\" class.",
      "Maciejewska's friend told police that Maciejewska wasn\u2019t happy with her marriage and that the couple disagreed on how to raise their son, according to the criminal complaint. Maciejewska allegedly told the friend she wanted a divorce but her husband disagreed; she also allegedly told the friend she and Gould \"set a firm date to discuss a divorce,\" according to the criminal complaint.",
      "A friend of Maciejewska told police that their son having dual citizenship and a Polish passport was a \"point of contention\" because Gould \"feared he would have no parental rights\" if she took the child to Poland, the complaint said.",
      "Maciejewska \"visited over 150 websites pertaining to divorce, signs of emotional abuse, psychological abuse, emotional blackmail, emotional abuse, narcissistic personality disorder, domestic abuse vs. normal martial conflict, and how to divorce an emotionally abusive husband,\" the complaint said.",
      "Gould allegedly told police \"they had spoken about a divorce\" but decided to use their townhouse \"as a place to decompress rather than separate completely,\" according to the complaint.",
      "After Gould reported Maciejewska missing, he allegedly \"stopped helping police attempt to locate his wife, wrote a check for a criminal defense attorney, clicked on an article about strangulation\" and got a second cellphone, according to the complaint.",
      "Gould, 60, was arrested Wednesday and is being held without bail on charges including first-degree murder and tampering with physical evidence, prosecutors said. His preliminary hearing is set for May 27.",
      "\"He's been living under the specter of this for eight years,\" Gould's defense attorney, Evan Kelly, told ABC News. \"At this point he just wants to clear his name in the court of law.\"",
      "Kelly declined to comment on any details of the case.",
      "Maciejewska\u2019s body has never been found, according to the criminal complaint.",

      "\"I am voting no,\" Republican Rep. Ralph Norman said Thursday afternoon, citing concerns about the bill adding to a bloated national debt.",
      "With Republican Rep. Brandon Gill expected to be absent, the GOP can only afford to lose one vote in the House Budget Committee to advance the bill. The committee is slated to convene Friday morning.",
      "Norman, who has had his arm twisted to fall in line on more than one occasion, said fellow Republican Rep. Chip Roy plans to vote no and \"thinks\" Republican Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia will vote against advancing the bill as well. Oklahoma Republican Rep. Josh Brecheen, a member of the House Budget Committee, appeared skeptical about the bill moving forward.",
      "\"We have a duty to know the true cost of this legislation before advancing it. If we are to operate in truth, we must have true numbers -- even if that means taking some more time to obtain that truth,\" he said on X, echoing similar concerns raised by Roy.",
      "Republicans will \"go back to work\" if the bill fails out of committee Friday, Norman said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the House budget negotiations are progressing after emerging from a conversation on the House floor later Thursday afternoon with some holdouts.",
      "\"We're going to look at some numbers tonight,\" he said. \"Keep this thing moving forward.\"",
      "Should the bill make it out of committee, Johnson still faces a tough road ahead as the Republican majority can withstand three no votes from within their ranks before losing sufficient support for passage. The effort to pass the Trump-backed bill is another crucial test of Johnson's speakership as he works to unify his divided conference.",
      "\"We're having a budget committee meeting tomorrow,\" Johnson said, adding that he has not asked Trump for assistance in getting some of the hard-liners to support the legislation. \"That's the plan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Several Republicans have passed on races they would have been competitive in.",
      "After major potential Republican candidates for key U.S. Senate races in 2026 passed on running, some Republicans are split on whether their party is struggling to recruit competitive Senate candidates.",
      "There are 35 Senate seats up for election in 2026 -- 33 in regular elections and two in special elections. Two of them, in Georgia and Michigan, could be a toss-up after two high-profile Republicans opted not to run in 2026, while seats in Minnesota and New Hampshire being vacated lean Democratic, and two seats from incumbents in Maine and North Carolina lean Republican, according to the Cook Political Report.",
      "Republicans currently hold 53 seats to Democrats' 45. Two independents caucus with Democrats.",
      "\"My goal is to stay in the majority; my stretch goal is to add seats. \u2026 I'd like to be at 55,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, recently told Axios.",
      "The seat up for election in Georgia -- held by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is running for reelection -- has received close attention from Republicans, who hope they can flip what is widely viewed as a vulnerable seat.",
      "But Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who had been seen as a major contender for the seat, took himself out of contention, saying he would not run for the seat.",
      "\"I have decided that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family,\" Kemp wrote in a statement on X in early May.",
      "Senate Republican leaders, including Scott and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and even President Donald Trump had spent several months attempting to convince Kemp to launch a bid against Ossoff. Kemp wrote that he informed Trump of his decision not to run the morning he posted.",
      "\"Brian Kemp, being the most popular Republican moderate in Georgia history, was the ideal candidate to take [Ossoff] on,\" Ryan Mahoney, a Georgia-based Republican strategist and former communications director for the Georgia Republican Party, told ABC News on Monday.",
      "In New Hampshire, Republicans faced a similar situation when the popular former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who had been mulling a run for Senate for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. D-N.H., said in early April that he had decided not to run.",
      "\"I kept the door open a little bit, and I thought about, is it right for me and my family? It's just not right for us,\" Sununu told a radio station in April.",
      "Sununu has said he still thinks the seat will be in play for Republicans.",
      "Some Republicans have pointed to Kemp's decision, and to a lesser extent Sununu's, as signs that Republicans are having challenges recruiting centrist candidates who would appeal to voters statewide. Some have also felt that candidates who appear too tied to Trump or too right-wing will struggle in statewide races even if they clear the primary, if the White House and Trump continue to face backlash toward policies and federal government cuts.",
      "\"I think it's a problem. I think that Trump has put a damper on that for the party in general. \u2026 Trump demands absolute loyalty and nothing else matters but fealty to him. And that makes people who want to talk about issues and things that their particular state or constituents care about -- [it] makes it very difficult,\" said ABC News contributor Barbara Comstock, a Republican who formerly represented Virginia in the House.",
      "But other Republicans are saying they don't believe Kemp and Sununu not running indicate any sign of challenges with recruiting candidates.",
      "A national Republican working on major Senate races told ABC News that Kemp's decision came as no surprise, arguing that the governor made a decision based on wanting to be present with his family after a long tenure as governor.",
      "As for concerns over public opinion of Trump, the operative also pointed to Trump's win in Georgia in 2024 and enthusiasm among Republicans in New Hampshire and noted that both the White House and candidates will continue to engage voters in the midterm elections to motivate them to turn out regardless of candidate.",
      "Mahoney, separately, pointed to how even though the party in power usually performs worse in a midterm election, news around the economy and other issues is constantly shifting and no one can predict yet if Trump's presidency and agenda by 2026 will be popular or \"an albatross.\"",
      "\"It's too early to know, and I think it would be really foolish for Democrats to assume, that just because history tells a story, that that is going to continue in 2026,\" Mahoney said.",
      "Since Kemp's decision, one member of Georgia's congressional delegation has since launched a bid, while a second just announced she won't run for the seat.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, who represents Georgia's 1st Congressional District, announced last week that he is entering the 2026 Senate race. In his announcement video, he branded himself as a \"MAGA Warrior,\" showing multiple pictures of him alongside Trump and a clip of Trump praising him.",

      "Georgia insurance and safety fire commissioner John King separately announced a bid for the seat on Monday.",
      "But questions swirled for weeks over whether Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -- a firebrand conservative and one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House -- would run for Senate. She told reporters on Wednesday she was considering either that or running for governor of Georgia. (Kemp is term-limited.)",
      "But on Friday, in an essay posted on X, Greene announced that she had decided not to run for Senate.",
      "\"I love my home state of Georgia so much. The people here may not be rich with the world's riches, but they are overflowing with kindness, love, family values, and a deep sense of joy, whether they're sitting on the front porch or the tailgate of a pickup truck. \u2026 These are the people I fight for,\" she wrote, before turning to criticize reports about donors and \"elites\" who are advocating candidates besides her.",
      "\"Can I deliver for the people of Georgia in the Senate? Can I fulfill my promises? Can I actually save this country from the inside? Here's the hard truth: the Senate doesn't work,\" she wrote. \"It's designed to obstruct the will of the people and protect the Uniparty's grip on power.\"",
      "After criticizing Senate leadership and senators who, she said, \"sabotage Trump's agenda,\" Greene was forthright: \"Someone once said, 'The Senate is where good ideas go to die.' They were right. That's why I'm not running.\"",
      "There were some early mixed signals over how Greene would have performed if she indeed ran against Ossoff. A recent poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that Ossoff and Kemp would be in a dead heat in a hypothetical general election matchup but that Ossoff would lead some other hypothetical candidates, including Greene, if the 2026 election were held today. (Like any poll about an election over a year out, much can still change.)",
      "And at least some Republicans may be privately applauding her decision.",
      "\"I think for most Georgia Republicans -- they were excited to see that [announcement]. They know that she has general election issues because of being a firebrand and because of her public persona,\" Mahoney said, adding that Georgia Republicans are likely looking for a candidate who can net endorsements, raise money, and consolidate the base.",
      "\"I think for the slate of candidates now, there's a lot more comfort that they would be able to win a nomination, to win the general, which is the most important here -- there's no real prize for being the nominee. You have to win the general election to become senator.\"",
      "Greene had brushed off any concerns that she could win in a primary but not a general statewide election in Georgia.",
      "\"They said the same thing about Donald Trump when he ran in 2016, and they said the same thing about it in 2024. People back in Georgia, they know that's a lie,\" Greene told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "She added in her post on Friday, \"Beating Jon Ossoff? That would be easy.\"",
      "The NRSC has indicated it'll consider getting involved in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis. Scott, who chairs the NRSC, told Fox News in February, \"Whatever is in the best interest of the voters in each state, I will make a state-by-state decision on how we play and where we play.\"",
      "\"Republicans are working as one team with President Trump to deliver for the American people, protect our Majority in 2026, and hold Senate Democrats and candidates in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire accountable for their radical, out-of-touch priorities,\" NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have been celebrating Kemp's decision, thinking that it puts them in a strong position to take on whoever challenges Ossoff. Democrats have also said they think they can expand their Senate map, and that they intend to play in as many seats as they can.",
      "But the Democratic Party, as it faces low approval ratings and continues to digest its heavy losses in 2024, faces a very challenging Senate map in 2026.",
      "Many of the Senate seats up for election are in solidly Republican-leaning states, and the Democrats face the prospect of defending Ossoff's seat in Georgia, as well as seats in Michigan and New Hampshire where Democratic incumbents are retiring.",
      "\"Senate Democrats are positioned to win seats in 2026 as midterm backlash driven by rising costs and threats to Social Security and Medicaid drags down Republican Senate candidates and puts their majority at risk,\" Maeve Coyle, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told ABC News in a statement.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify before two congressional committees on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy said his \"opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the nation's most publicly recognized vaccine skeptics, took a softened approach on vaccines when he answered questions before a House committee Wednesday morning, saying, \"I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.\"",
      "Kennedy, who also testified before a Senate committee the same day, defended the massive cuts to the department's workforce and laid out his priorities for the Trump administration's proposed budget.",
      "Kennedy's congressional committee appearances marked the first time he testified before Congress since his confirmation hearings in late January, and forced Kennedy to confront statements he made that critics said were evidence of promises broken.",
      "Kennedy says his 'opinions about vaccines are irrelevant'",
      "During the House hearing, Kennedy avoided sharing his own thoughts about vaccines -- which have previously invited skepticism -- instead deferring to the doctors running the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Asked by Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan if he would today vaccinate his own children for measles and chickenpox, Kennedy said \"probably\" for measles, but that \"what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "\"I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive, but I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He said he has directed NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya to try to \"lay out the pros and cons, the risks and benefits, accurately as we understand them, with replicable studies,\" for people to \"make that decision.\"",
      "His comments mark a departure from his strong opinions about vaccines before taking office as HHS secretary.",
      "During his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy said that he supports vaccines, although he refused to unequivocally say that vaccines don't cause autism, despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link. However, in March, the HHS confirmed that the CDC will study whether vaccines cause autism.",
      "Shortly after Kennedy said people should not take his medical advice, some public health experts criticized the comments -- with one saying that giving people guidance \"is [Kennedy's] job.\"",
      "\"The problem is that is his job -- the top line of his job description -- is the nation's chief health strategist. That is the top line of every health official, federal, state, local leader. That is his job, is to give people the best advice that he can. I believe that he's giving up on, in my view, his chief responsibility,\" Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told reporters on a call in which he and other health leaders responded to Kennedy's testimony in front of the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "Benjamin pointed out that Kennedy has, in fact, seemed to advise people on how to treat measles, leading them toward unproven remedies.",
      "Democrats push Kennedy on cuts: 'You can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done'",
      "Democrats on both the House and Senate committees questioned Kennedy about cuts to HHS -- with several testy exchanges.",
      "In April, HHS began laying off about 10,000 workers and consolidating 28 institutes and centers into 15 new divisions.",
      "Including the roughly 10,000 people who have left over the last few months through early retirement or deferred resignation programs, the overall staff at HHS is expected to fall from 82,000 to around 62,000 -- or about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, quoting ABC News' reporting last week, asked Kennedy about cuts to the CDC's lead poisoning prevention program.",
      "Though the program has been completely gutted and the expert staff has been laid off, Kennedy said he believes lead poisoning to be an \"extremely significant concern\" and said he does not intend to eliminate the program.",
      "Kennedy suggested that HHS would still spend the money appropriated to the program -- but didn't offer any details on how the work would continue without any expert staff.",
      "In another heated exchange, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray asked Kennedy about cuts to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, including the reinstatements that are mostly in Ohio and West Virginia. She said no one has been reinstated in the Western states, including at the Spokane, Washington, office that does research into miner safety.",
      "\"The work in NIOSH will not be interrupted,\" Kennedy said. \"We understand it's critically important function, and I did not want to see it end.\"",
      "Murray quipped back, \"I would just say you can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done.\"",
      "During the earlier House hearing, Kennedy continued to maintain that widespread cuts at HHS have not impacted key health programs, saying he has not withheld any funding for lifesaving research at NIH and continues to prioritize pillars such as Head Start, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "But in a tense back-and-forth with Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, she demanded Kennedy's assurance that he would not cut programs that have been approved and funded by Congress, which has \"the power of the purse\" ascribed to it in the Constitution.",
      "Kennedy said he would spend appropriated money -- which drew repeated exasperation from DeLauro, who pointed to $20 billion in cuts to NIH.",
      "Kennedy asserted that his goal at HHS is to focus on the chronic disease epidemic and deliver effective services for those who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and other services by cutting costs to taxpayers.",
      "\"We intend to do more, a lot more with less. The budget I'm presenting today supports these goals and reflects two enduring American values, compassion and responsibility,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro slammed Kennedy and the Trump's administration for the cuts to HHS, including the elimination of entire divisions.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you are gutting the life-saving work of the Department of Health and Human Services and its key agencies while the Republicans in this Congress say and do nothing,\" DeLauro said. \"Because of these cuts, people will die.\"",
      "DeLauro also finished the hearing with an impassioned plea for Kennedy to stop cutting programs, telling him he does not have the authority to go against what Congress allocated in the budget.",
      "\"You do not have the authority to do what you are doing,\" she said.",
      "Kennedy defends measles outbreak response, measles vaccine stance",
      "Kennedy rebuked criticism of his agency's response to the measles outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases for the first time in five years, according to the CDC.",
      "A total of 92 patients have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak and two school-aged children died in Texas. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.",
      "\"We are doing a better job at CDC today than any nation in the world controlling this measles outbreak,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro hit back, saying that Kennedy's comparison of the U.S. response to measles to the response of other countries was unfair.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you keep comparing the U.S. to other countries, compare us to Europe, but the Europe you are referring to is the WHO European region, [which] has 53 countries in Europe and in Asia, including those with low ... vaccination rates like Romania and that has never eliminated measles,\" she said. \"If you compare us to western Europe countries that we often compare ourselves to, like Great Britain, they have seen no measles death.\"",
      "Kennedy argued that the U.S. is doing better than other countries in the Americas with smaller populations, including Canada and Mexico.",
      "DeLauro scolded Kennedy for promoting vaccine skepticism in the wake of a measles outbreak spreading across the U.S.",
      "Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines. In a post on X on April 6, Kennedy said that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are recognized treatments or cures for measles.",
      "A particularly heated moment occurred when Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told Kennedy that the secretary has equivocated when discussing the measles vaccine. Murphy noted instances in which Kennedy has touted the effectiveness of the vaccine before listing its potential harms.",
      "Kennedy, angry at the line of questioning, interrupted Murphy, claiming his prior comments were true.",
      "When Murphy pressed for Kennedy to say directly whether he recommended the measles vaccine for people, Kennedy, who told CBS News in an April interview that he did recommend the shot, said, \"I am not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there's issues. I need to respect people's intelligence.\"",
      "Vaccine specialists say the measles vaccine is durable and two doses in your youth is sufficient for lifelong protection without the need for a booster. The CDC notes on its website that the agency \"considers people who received two doses of measles vaccine as children according to the U.S. vaccination schedule protected for life, and they do not ever need a booster dose.\"",
      "Numerous studies over decades across multiple countries have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes. Additionally, monitoring for the safety of a vaccine does not end after the shot has been licensed for use. There are federal health databases in which anyone can report side effects or reactions following a vaccine -- officials are then able to review these reports and identify any potential safety issues.",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem came under fire from House Democrats while testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee on her department's 2026 budget on Wednesday.",
      "The hearing quickly turned to immigration and featured back-and-forths with Democrats on the committee, with ranking member Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., telling Noem that under her leadership, it is a \"sad day for DHS.\"",
      "\"Frankly, I've never seen anything like this that served as a lead Democrat on this committee. Even when, madam secretary, my Republican colleagues and I had strong disagreements, we still have productive conversations and did our duty keep America safe. But that's not the case any longer,\" Thompson told Noem, adding that he is glad that Noem \"found time among your many photo ops and costume changes to testify.\"",
      "\"On your watch, the department is breaking the law, it's hurting people, and it's making America less safe,\" he added. \"The Trump administration is outright lying to the courts and the American people.\"",
      "Noem was asked about what occurred last week in New Jersey as three members of Congress attempted to gain access to Delany Hall, a private detention center that is holding ICE detainees, and testified that it was \"lawless.\" The incident outside the detention center resulted in a melee and ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who is also running for New Jersey governor, getting arrested.",
      "\"We have footage of those members of Congress slamming their bodies into our law enforcement officers, shoving them screaming profanities in their faces, striking them with their fists and otherwise assaulting law enforcement,\" Noem testified. \"The behavior was lawlessness, and it was beneath this body. Members of Congress should not break into detention centers or federal facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we certainly would have facilitated a tour.\"",
      "Delany Hall falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the members of Congress argued they had a right to conduct lawful \"oversight\" on the facility through their congressional responsibilities.",
      "\"They were cooperating with criminals to create criminal acts. This wasn't oversight. This was committing felonies,\" Noem said earlier this week on Fox News. \"This was going out and attacking people who stand up for the rule of law, and it was absolutely horrible.\"",
      "Later in the hearing, Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., slammed Noem for what he said was a lack of access to legal counsel.",
      "\"You are deporting children with cancer, children who are U.S. citizens, a gay makeup artist who committed no crime and didn't even enter the country illegally,\" Magaziner told Noem. \"Instead of focusing on real criminals, you have allowed innocent children to be deported while you fly around the country playing dress-up for the cameras.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Noem and House Republicans highlighted what she called \"total operational control\" of the southern border. Noem said she doesn't know how many immigrants lacking legal status to be in the U.S. were released into the country during the Biden administration and touted that the Trump administration has focused on fixing the border crisis.",

      "The company claims Fox News \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages.\"",
      "The multibillion dollar defamation lawsuit brought by voting machine company Smartmatic against Fox News lurched forward this week with new allegations filed by Smartmatic that Fox executives destroyed text messages -- and a new ruling Fox News won that will allow them access to new documents that could help their defense.",
      "Smartmatic, in a court filing Wednesday, alleged that Fox News and Fox Corp \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchy\" -- a filing that comes as Fox continues to fight the defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company over the network's 2020 election claims.",
      "Smartmatic claims those who \"deleted their texts\" include founder Rupert Mudoch and chairman Lachlan Murdoch.",
      "\"The destruction was not isolated or accidental,\" the filing, which was largely redacted, claims. \"It was extensive and willful.\"",
      "The claims were revealed in an introduction to the motion that was publicly filed with the court, though the rest of the motion remained redacted due to a 2022 \"confidentially stipulation\" between the parties.",
      "Smartmatic sued Fox and other defendants in 2021, claiming they \"knowingly and intentionally\" lied about Smartmatic in the wake of the 2020 election regarding claims of voting machine fraud, causing Smartmatic to lose business.",
      "Fox has said they were covering newsworthy allegations made by President Donald Trump and others, and has accused Smartmatic of looking to profit off a lawsuit.",
      "In its filing, Smartmatic alleges that \"Fox custodians\" deleted their text messages from November and December 2020, creating \"an evidentiary void.\"",
      "\"Fox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts and why Fox continued airing them anyway,\" the filing states. \"While it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executives' incriminating communications would never see daylight.\"",
      "As such, Smartmatic is asking that the jury in the case \"be charged with an adverse inference instruction\" -- a legal instruction given by a judge to a jury allowing them to assume that the unavailable evidence was unfavorable to the party that was unable to produce it.",
      "The filing from Smartmatic comes one day after a New York appeals judge ruled that Fox News can gain access to documents related to an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into three Smartmatic executives.",
      "In a statement, Fox said Wednesday's motion by Smartmatic was \"a desperate attempt to distract\" from the winning ruling Fox News secured Tuesday in the case.",
      "\"Smartmatic weakly attempts to resurrect stale, baseless discovery issues that actually were disclosed by FOX and resolved two years ago,\" the statement said. \"These issues have no bearing on the merits of Smartmatic's case, which has fallen apart at every turn.\"",
      "The statement went on to say that Fox would be filing its own motion shortly \"that outlines Smartmatic's actual massive failure to preserve evidence, including direct written instructions by Smartmatic's CEO to delete relevant text messages on the eve of filing this lawsuit.\"",
      "Three current and former executives of Smartmatic were charged in a criminal indictment last year accusing them of a \"bribery and money laundering scheme\" in order to obtain contracts in the Philippines, according to an indictment, which does not name Smartmatic by name.",
      "A judge ruled that the documents were \"plainly relevant\" to Smartmatic's profits, which Smartmatic has alleged plunged due to the election-related statements made by Fox. But Fox News has argued there were other factors for Smartmatic's alleged lost profits, such as the criminal indictment.",
      "In a statement responding to the ruling, Smartmatic attorneys claimed they had \"already agreed\" to the discovery.",
      "\"Fox trying to blame anyone other than itself for Smartmatic's injuries is just more lies from Fox,\" said Smartmatic's legal counsel Erik Connolly. \"The writing is on the wall. Lies have consequences.\"",
      "Fox representatives praised the ruling, saying in a statement they were \"pleased\" with the ruling and that the \"factual evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on FOX News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech.\"",
      "Materials that Smartmatic must disclose include \"all internal documents concerning discussions or analysis of the impact of the indictment on the company\" as well as \"all communications received from any actual or potential customer about the indictment.\"",
      "In a statement at the time, Smartmatic said, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted. Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency. These are the values that Smartmatic lives by.\"",

      "House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris called the Medicaid plan \"a joke.\"",
      "\"The proposal to stop waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid will do little to achieve that. The common-sense work requirement for able-bodied adults doesn't start for four years (into the next administration) and CAN BE WAIVED by any state for \"hardship\" that they determine (and they will). What a joke. The swamp is real. And by the way\u2026the federal government should NOT pay states more for able-bodied, working-age adults on Medicaid than it pays states for children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities on Medicaid,\" Harris said in a post on X.",
      "Rep. Victoria Spartz, who often changes her position, said on X, \"the GOP is legalizing Medicaid for illegals at a higher federal match rate than for the most vulnerable Americans -- seems hypocritical and screwed up.\"",
      "Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick took issue with the package at large.",
      "\"I don't think I'm a yes right now, but that shouldn't surprise anybody. We have several things to work out. There's got to be a minimum savings in this year. The reason I say this is because, if you give me a 10-year plan, tell me why that won't change next year,\" he said.",
      "Republicans voted 30-24 to advance the bill to the House Budget Committee, which will tie together the 11 bills under reconciliation on Friday.",
      "Ranking member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said Democrats put up a \"good fight\" throughout the markup. Democrats held up photos and told emotional stories of their constituents who rely on Medicaid, warning that millions of Americans will go uninsured under the GOP plan.",
      "Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got into a testy exchange with GOP Rep. Randy Weber around 3 a.m. Wednesday when she asked a question about consequences for those who had miscarriages under the proposal's new work requirements to receive Medicare.",

      "Later, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Weber's comment and said, \"I am talking to them [constituents], and I will not yield because it was a terribly disrespectful comment, and I will not yield to disrespectful men.\"",
      "Weber apologized to Ocasio Cortez later Wednesday.",

      "For now, the referendum is set to appear on a ballot in 2026.",
      "Missouri lawmakers passed a voter referendum Wednesday that, if approved, would repeal protections for abortion rights and restore a ban on nearly all abortion care in the state.",
      "The move comes just six months after Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom, including abortion care, in the state constitution, effectively overturning a near-total abortion ban that was in effect. A circuit court affirmed the right to reproductive freedom in December.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- The Utah Supreme Court ruled Thursday that \u201cnumerous constitutional violations\u201d during the trial and sentencing of a man who spent decades on death row merit a new trial.",
      "Justices affirmed the ruling of a lower court judge who had ordered a new trial for Douglas Stewart Carter after finding issues with how police and prosecutors handled his case. Carter, 69, was sentenced to death in 1985 after a jury found him guilty of murdering Eva Olesen, the aunt of a former Provo police chief who was found stabbed a dozen times and shot in the head.",
      "While no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene, prosecutors convicted Carter, a Black man, based on a written confession and two witnesses who said he had bragged about killing Olesen, a white woman. Carter has argued his confession was coerced.",
      "In 2019, the Utah Supreme Court sent Carter\u2019s case back to a lower court for review after the witnesses \u2014 two immigrants without legal status \u2014 said police and prosecutors offered to pay their rent, coached them to lie in court and threatened to deport them or their son if they did not implicate Carter.",
      "Judge Derek Pullan ordered a new trial in 2022, saying the witness testimonies and police misconduct prejudiced the original trial. The Utah Attorney General's office appealed, leading to the high court's decision Thursday.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that these numerous constitutional violations \u2014 suppressing evidence, suborning perjury, and knowingly failing to correct false testimony \u2014 prejudiced Carter at both his trial and sentencing,\u201d Justice Paige Petersen wrote in the high court\u2019s opinion.",
      "It's rare, she added, to see a case involving \u201cmultiple instances of intentional misconduct\u201d by two police officers, including the lead investigator, and a prosecutor. Provo Police Lt. George Pierpont had obtained the confession from Carter, and Officer Richard Mack gathered witness statements. The postconviction court also found that prosecutor Wayne Watson was present when police directed a witness to lie, and that he did not correct the false testimony during trial.",
      "Carter remains in prison while he awaits a new trial, said his attorney, Eric Zuckerman.",
      "\u201cMr. Carter has spent more than forty years behind bars because of an unconstitutional conviction rooted in police and prosecutorial misconduct \u2014 including the suborning of perjury before a jury of his peers,\u201d Zuckerman said in a statement. \"We are gratified that both the trial court and the Utah Supreme Court have validated Mr. Carter\u2019s claims. But no ruling can restore the four decades of freedom the state of Utah unjustly took from him.\u201d",
      "Carter is among several inmates involved in a separate lawsuit challenging Utah's execution methods and protocols.",
      "Olesen's family has repeatedly expressed frustration that the decades-old murder case is ongoing.",

      "SEATTLE -- A judge on Thursday rescinded an order that would have required the Trump administration to admit some 12,000 refugees into the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle issued the order earlier this month, following instructions from a federal appeals court that said the government must process refugees who before Jan. 20 already had \u201carranged and confirmable\u201d travel plans to enter the U.S. That's the day President Donald Trump took office and suspended the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program.",

      "As an example of who should be admitted, the appeals court noted the case of one plaintiff, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo who sold his family's belongings and gave up the lease on their home because he, his wife and their child were supposed to fly to the U.S. on Jan. 22 before the administration canceled their travel.",
      "In his order Thursday, Whitehead said the government should admit 160 refugees who had plans to come to the U.S. within two weeks of Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cThe Government must process, admit, and provide statutorily mandated resettlement support services to these Injunction Protected Refugees immediately,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Thousands of other refugees who had plans to arrive after that would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, Whitehead said. He said he would appoint a special master to conduct those assessments, and he asked lawyers for refugee assistance groups who brought the lawsuit and the Justice Department to suggest potential candidates for that role.",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Upon beginning his second term on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending the program.",
      "That triggered a lawsuit by individual refugees whose efforts to resettle in the U.S. have been halted as well as major refugee aid groups, who argued that they have had to lay off staff. The groups said the administration froze their funding for processing refugee applications overseas and providing support, such as short-term rental assistance for those already in the U.S.",
      "Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, blocked enforcement of Trump\u2019s order, saying it amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program.",
      "The 9th Circuit Court largely put Whitehead\u2019s decision on hold in March, finding that the administration was likely to win the case given the president\u2019s broad authority to determine who is allowed to enter the country.",

      "Challengers tell a federal appeals court that Georgia lawmakers haven\u2019t done enough to end illegal harms to Black voters",
      "ATLANTA -- Challengers on Thursday told a federal appeals court that Georgia lawmakers are still violating Black voters\u2019 rights after redrawing the state\u2019s congressional and legislative maps.",
      "If judges uphold the challenges, they could order different district lines to be used in Georgia for the rest of the decade, making it possible that more districts would elect candidates favored by Black voters \u2014 usually Democrats.",
      "The voting rights groups argued in three cases that lawmakers created additional majority-Black districts, but didn't do enough to address the harms suffered in the areas where they proved at trial that there was illegal vote dilution.",
      "For state Senate and House maps, the area in question is in Atlanta's southern suburbs. For the congressional map, it's in areas north and west of downtown Atlanta. But lawmakers drew in Black voters in other parts of the metro area to make new Black-majority districts.",
      "\u201cGoing to a different part of Atlanta to create opportunities for Black voters is not sufficient,\u201d said Ari Savitzky, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union representing those challenging state legislative maps.",
      "Lawyers for the state, defending the current maps, say that the state has complied with a court ruling ordering new maps and that the challengers can't demand new districts in exact locations. Stephen Petrany, Georgia\u2019s solicitor general, says the challengers are really trying to elect more Democrats, and that the court shouldn't let them use the lawsuits to do that.",
      "\u201cAre these the right number of districts? Yes. Are they in the right area? Yes,\" Petrany told judges. \"That is the end of this case.\u201d",
      "Judge Adalberto Jordan said any decision on redrawing maps would wait until after a ruling on a separate challenge to U.S. District Judge Steve Jones' original decision by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In that case, argued in January, Raffensperger contends that Jones\u2019 decision should be overturned and the state should revert to the maps that lawmakers drew in 2021 before Jones ruled they were illegal under the 1964 Voting Rights Act. Section 2 of that law protects minority voters.",
      "The challengers have a steep climb. Jones ruled in 2023 after a trial that lines were drawn to illegally dilute Black votes. But he accepted maps drawn by lawmakers in special session as fixing the illegalities. For the three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the map, the judges must rule that Jones abused his discretion.",
      "Jones rejected claims that the new maps didn\u2019t do enough to help Black voters. Jones said he couldn\u2019t interfere with legislative choices, even if Republicans moved to protect their power. But challengers say Jones was too deferential to lawmakers even when he had already found they had acted illegally.",
      "Jordan repeatedly pushed the challengers on how many of the affected voters had to be included in new districts. Lawyers for the challengers said there was no set standard, but that Georgia lawmakers hadn\u2019t done enough.",
      "Abha Khanna, representing challengers in two lawsuits said the new map \u201claundered Black voters across districts deftly to create the illusion of new opportunities.\u201d",
      "While the maps created additional Black-majority districts, they also locked in Republican advantages. In a state where GOP candidates in competitive races win at best 53% or 54% of the vote statewide, Republicans hold 64% of congressional seats, or 9 of 14. They hold 59% of state Senate seats, or 33 of 56. The state House is a little closer to parity, with Republicans holding 100 of 180 seats, or 56%.",
      "If the current maps are not overturned, Georgia is likely to use them through the 2030 state elections.",

Legislative leaders from both parties accepted that challenge, he said, and came up with a fiscally responsible balanced budget despite their ideological differences.",

The session got off to a chaotic start in January when Democratic House members boycotted it for three weeks until a power struggle was resolved. Senate Democrats hold just a one-vote, 34-33 majority. Those razor-thin margins mean at least some bipartisan support is needed to enact anything.",
      "\"So I\u2019m truly grateful for the work,\u201d Walz said at a news conference. \u201cGrateful that Minnesota sends legislators here that understand that we may have differences, but we have not succumbed to the idea that we let dysfunction rule, and democracy and compromise are still seen as virtues instead of vices.\u201d",
      "However, Walz may still need to call legislators back for a one-day special session to finish the two-year budget, which will come in around $66 billion to 67 billion and take effect July 1. The adjournment deadline is Monday. A special session would likely be held before the Memorial Day weekend.",
      "Walz hasn\u2019t announced yet whether he will seek a third term as governor in 2026. Nor has he ruled out a presidential run.",
      "But he's one of several potential 2028 Democratic contenders touring the country as the party seeks future national leaders. He makes frequent appearances on cable TV shows and visits to early-primary states. He went to Iowa in March to launch a series of town halls in competitive congressional districts represented by Republicans. And he's scheduled to make appearances May 31 at Democratic gatherings in both South Carolina and California.",
      "The leaders expressed confidence that \u2014 despite some deep remaining differences that quickly flared up Thursday \u2014 they will have enough votes to pass everything. Many progressive Democrats are angry, and the Senate Republican minority didn't sign off on the deal but supports parts of the agreement.",
      "GOP House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, paid tribute to the governor for \u201cgetting us all into the same room\u201d to talk through differences. Republicans claimed a big win by blocking any general tax increases, except for a small bump in the state\u2019s recreational cannabis tax.",
      "\u201cWe worked well together, and I\u2019m very proud of the work that we did,\u201d Demuth said. \u201cAm I perfectly happy about it? No. And I know I\u2019m not alone in standing with other leaders here that are not happy about every part. But we worked very, very well together.\u201d",
      "The top House Democratic leader, Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said the governor's role was crucial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to really thank the governor for his strong leadership in these negotiations, keeping us all focused on the end goal of fiscal responsibility, and having those hard conversations and getting through the hard things,\u201d Hortman said.",
      "The deal includes a compromise that Walz floated to try to resolve one of the biggest sticking points. A top Republican demand was that a state-funded health care program for the working poor, called MinnesotaCare, should exclude undocumented immigrants. The deal lets undocumented children stay in the program, but undocumented adults will have to seek coverage elsewhere.",
      "That retreat sparked an angry protest by progressive legislators, who pounded on the door to the governor's reception room while the news conference was in progress and chanted, \u201cYou're killing our communities.\u201d They held a news conference afterward to say the agreement will deprive thousands of the state's most vulnerable people of life-saving health care. They said Walz and Democratic leaders should not have given in.",
      "\u201cWe can not vote for that. We're not ready to accept that for our neighbors, for our friends, for our families,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Cedrick Frazier, of New Hope.",

      "The 78-year-old has brushed portraits of world leaders and people who immigrated to the U.S. But his newest collection draws on scenes much closer to home: his presidential library in Dallas.",
      "The exhibit opened Thursday at the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush moved to Dallas after he left the White House in 2009, and he took up oil painting a few years later.",
      "The 35 new works are an ode not only to life at the center but also SMU. The exhibit called \u201cA Shining City on the Hilltop\" is both a nod to SMU\u2019s nickname \u2014 The Hilltop \u2014 and former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous use of the phrase \u201cshining city upon a hill\u201d to refer to America, said Teresa Lenling, director of the presidential museum.",
      "\u201cThis features not just the places around the SMU campus but it really takes a look at the people that are the heart of this campus and the community,\u201d said Lenling, adding that Bush composed the paintings from photos taken around the center and campus.",
      "One of the paintings comes from the center's opening in 2013, when then-President Barack Obama and all of the still-living former presidents, including Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, posed in front of the new building.",
      "Devon Yarbrough, who works at the center, said she was \u201cvery surprised\u201d but pleased to spot her herself in one of the paintings. She\u2019s depicted reading a book on her lunch break while sitting on a bench under tree in the center\u2019s 15-acre park.",
      "This is the fifth exhibit of George W. Bush's art to be featured at the center. His first exhibit was a collection of portraits of world leaders including including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Dalai Lama.",
      "He's also done a collection of paintings of military veterans, which were featured in his book \u201cPortraits of Courage,\u201d and painted portraits of people who immigrated to the U.S., which are compiled in his book \u201cOut of Many, One.\u201d",
      "The exhibit is on display through Oct. 19.",

      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, that would deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. It has been put on nationwide holds by lower court orders.",
      "The administration is now appealing, on an emergency basis, the authority of individual judges to issue these rulings, known as nationwide, or universal, injunctions. The constitutionality of the executive order itself is not yet before the court.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "TRUMP, discussing birthright citizenship in a Truth Social post: \u201cThe United States of America is the only Country in the World that does this, for what reason, nobody knows.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: This is not true. About 30 countries, including the U.S., offer unconditional birthright citizenship, according to the CIA World Factbook and the Library of Congress. Birthright citizenship was enshrined in the Constitution after the Civil War to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be citizens.",
      "\u201cThe statement is pretty obviously wrong,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a professor of law at George Mason University who is an expert on constitutional law and migration rights. \u201cMany countries have birthright citizenship, though in some of them the rules are different from those in the US.\u201d",
      "Birthright citizenship is a principle known as jus soli or \u201cright of the soil.\u201d It bases citizenship on a person being born within a country's territory. In contrast, the principle of jus sanguinis or \u201cright of blood\u201d determines citizenship based on the citizenship of one's parents or other ancestors.",
      "Citizenship is granted to anyone born in the U.S., regardless of the parents\u2019 immigration status. Only children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government, and of enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation do not qualify. Those born to parents of sovereign Native American tribes were also excluded until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.",
      "Most countries with unconditional birthright citizenship, among them Canada and Mexico, are concentrated in the Americas. The rest are in Africa and Asia. Some countries offer citizenship to those born in their territory to noncitizen parents only under certain conditions, such as the legal status of their parents or the age of the person applying for citizenship based on place of birth.",
      "The first sentence of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, often referred to as the Citizenship Clause, guarantees birthright citizenship. It states: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "This clause effectively overturned the notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857, in which the Supreme Court held that Black people, no matter whether or not they were enslaved, were not citizens. It was ratified, along with the rest of the 14th Amendment, in 1868 after it was passed by the Senate in 1866. The Civil War ended in 1865.",
      "Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship conflicts with a Supreme Court decision from 1898 that held that the Citizenship Clause made citizens of all children born on U.S. soil with narrow exceptions that are not at issue in the case currently before the court.",
      "The justices are also considering appeals from the Trump administration on several other issues, many related to immigration.",

      "Republicans continue to make progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and beefed-up border security, though considerable divisions remain as Speaker Mike Johnson attempts to bridge the differences in his conference",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are advancing President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and beefed-up border security as Speaker Mike Johnson attempts to pass the package over unified Democratic opposition by Memorial Day.",
      "House committees have labored on the legislation, which runs a whopping 1,116 pages and is titled the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d a nod to Trump himself.",
      "Still, GOP divisions run high. Fiscal conservatives worry the bill doesn\u2019t cut Medicaid spending enough, while Republicans from competitive swing districts warn that they can\u2019t support a bill that would jeopardize access to health coverage and food assistance for constituents.",
      "Democrats say they will fight what House party leader Hakeem Jeffries calls \u201cthis extreme and toxic bill.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in and out of the legislative package so far:",
      "Central to the GOP package is more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code.",
      "Republicans look to make permanent the individual income tax cuts passed in Trump\u2019s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.",
      "To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden's presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.",
      "But lawmakers from New York, California and other high-tax states say the boost for state and local tax deductions, called SALT, is insufficient. As proposed, it rises from $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making less than $400,000 per year. They are pushing for more.",
      "The bill also includes a temporary $2,000 boost to the standard deduction, bringing it to $32,000 for joint filers. And there is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500.",
      "The estate tax exemption raises to $15 million.",
      "Several of the provisions Trump touted on the campaign trail would be temporary, lasting roughly through his second term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That's also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "House Republicans are looking to shift some of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to the states.",
      "States would shoulder 5% of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75% of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.",
      "Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.",
      "Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.",
      "At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.",
      "A focal point of the package is nearly $800 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirement would not kick in until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump leaves office. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.",
      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by at least 7.6 million from the Medicaid changes, and possibly more with other changes to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.",
      "The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.",
      "The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.",
      "Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.",
      "And the bill would allow the Trump administration to remove the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that it says support terrorism. That will create what some nonprofits say is an arbitrary standard to financially punish charities that advocate for issues that don\u2019t align with Trump's agenda.",
      "\u201cMAGA\u201d is shorthand for Trump's signature line, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But in this case, it means \u201cMoney Accounts for Growth and Advancement.\u201d",
      "For parents or guardians who open new \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.",
      "Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50% of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.",
      "The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.",
      "There's $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There's also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.",
      "Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.",
      "There's also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.",
      "It would provide $25 billion for Trump's \u201cGolden Dome for America,\u201d a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation's ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.",

      "\u201cA \u2018friend of Harvey\u2019 was a woman that he\u2019d meet at events or parties or festivals or \u2014 somewhere,\u201d said Elizabeth Perz, one of his executive assistants from 2011 to 2013.",

It was such common practice that Weinstein's subordinates had a shorthand: \u201cMight as well add a FOH column,\u201d Perz advised colleagues by email as they discussed the attendee list for some 2013 awards-season events.",
      "Jurors were shown a roster of well over a dozen names, which Perz said was kept in the office at Weinstein\u2019s now-defunct production company. The names were broken down by geography, such as \u201cLA Friends\u201d or \u201cCannes/Etc/all invites.\"",

      "During the last five years, he was convicted of various sex crimes in both New York and California. But he's on trial again because an appeals court found that his New York trial was tainted by prejudicial testimony and overturned that conviction. He's charged with raping Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on two other women, separately, in 2006.",
      "Mann, who was a hairstylist and aspiring actor when she met Weinstein in the early 2010s, is expected to testify in the coming days or week. The other accusers, Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, already have taken the stand.",
      "At Weinstein's 2020 trial, Mann painted a complex and emotional picture of a yearslong relationship that began consensually but became \u201cdegrading\u201d and volatile and eventually exploded into rape. Still, she kept seeing him and sending warm messages because she wanted him to believe she \"wasn\u2019t a threat,\u201d she testified.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers at the time argued that Mann willingly had a sexual liaison with him to serve her acting ambitions. At one point during his defense's questioning in 2020, she began sobbing so forcefully that court ended early that day.",
      "At the retrial on Thursday, jurors saw messages that Perz had sent to Mann about some Oscars-related parties in 2013.",
      "\u201cHarvey would like to extend an invitation to you\u201d and a friend, Perz wrote.",

      "\u201cWe urge that any transfers cease immediately and that there be direct and open engagement with governors,\u201d the Association said in April. The group was not immediately available to comment on Space Force's plan.",

      "Last week, the Trump administration announced a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul an air traffic control system that relies on antiquated equipment. Air travel is safe even if the air traffic control system is old, but the problems in Newark were unacceptable and could have been prevented if the system had been upgraded sooner, said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a Thursday op-ed in Newsweek.",
      "The Newark airport has generally led the nation in flight cancellations and delays ever since both radar and communications went out on April 28 and again on May 9. A third similar problem happened Sunday, but that time the backup system worked and kept radar online.",

Likewise, Tallahassee State College, which Ikner previously attended, had no disciplinary referrals or reports on file of Ikner making threats against other students. FSU also has no record of Ikner seeking mental health counseling, being reported for violent comments or facing disciplinary referrals, jurors found.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure Thursday prohibiting local governments from adding fluoride to their water systems, making it the second state in the country after Utah to implement a statewide ban on the mineral.",
      "DeSantis signed the bill at a public event in Dade City, Florida, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates.",
      "\u201cWe have other ways where people can get access to fluoride,\" DeSantis said at a public event earlier this month. \"When you do this in the water supply, you\u2019re taking away a choice of someone who may not want to have overexposure to fluoride.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers approved the bill last month, requiring the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state. Utah was the first state to ban fluoride in late March, and its prohibition went into effect last week, while Florida\u2019s provision is effective July 1.",
      "Some local governments in Florida have already voted to remove fluoride from their water, ahead of the statewide ban. Earlier this month, Miami-Dade County commissioners voted to override a veto by Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and move forward with plans to remove fluoride from the county\u2019s drinking water.",
      "\u201cWater fluoridation is a safe, effective, and efficient way to maintain dental health in our county \u2013 and halting it could have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families,\u201d Levine Cava said in a statement defending her veto.",
      "Some Republican-led states have sought to impose bans following a push by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop fluoridating water. Earlier this month, DeSantis pledged to sign the bill and was flanked by the state\u2019s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who has attracted national scrutiny over his opposition to policies embraced by public health experts, including COVID-19 vaccine mandates.",
      "Fluoride is a mineral that has been added to drinking water for generations to strengthen teeth and reduce cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Excess fluoride intake has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. And studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",

      "A hospital is using a breathing tube and other measures to keep a brain-dead Georgia woman's body functioning because she is pregnant",
      "ATLANTA -- A pregnant woman in Georgia was declared brain-dead after a medical emergency and has been kept on life support for three months by doctors to allow enough time for the baby to be born and comply with Georgia\u2019s strict anti-abortion law, family members say.",
      "The case is the latest consequence of abortion bans introduced in some states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago.",
      "Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was declared brain-dead \u2014 meaning she is legally dead \u2014 in February, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than three months ago and went to Atlanta's Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was later declared brain-dead.",
      "Newkirk said Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would likely kill the fetus.",
      "Neither hospital immediately responded to emails Thursday from The Associated Press.",
      "Smith's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because of a provision in state law that bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, opening the door to state abortion bans. Georgia's ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the life of the woman.",
      "Smith's family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.",
      "Newkirk said doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he\u2019s born,\u201d Newkirk said. Newkirk has not commented on whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.",
      "Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, which is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia\u2019s strict abortion law, said the situation is problematic.",
      "\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\u201d Simpson said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\u201d",
      "Lois Shepherd, a bioethicist and law professor at the University of Virginia, said she does not believe Georgia's law requires life support in this case.",
      "But she said whether a state could insist Smith remains on the breathing and other devices is uncertain since the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned all the parts of the Roe ruling, including the finding that fetuses do not have the rights of people.",
      "\u201cPre-Dobbs, a fetus didn\u2019t have any rights,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cAnd the state\u2019s interest in fetal life could not be so strong as to overcome other important rights, but now we don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Georgia's law confers personhood on a fetus. Those who favor personhood say fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses should be considered people with the same rights as those already born.",
      "Georgia state Sen. Ed Setzler, a Republican who sponsored the 2019 law, said he supported Emory\u2019s interpretation.",
      "\u201cI think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,\u201d Setzler said. \u201cI think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\u201d",
      "Setzler said he believes it is sometimes acceptable to remove life support from someone who is brain dead, but said the law is \u201can appropriate check\u201d because the mother is pregnant.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a valuable human life that we have an opportunity to save and I think it\u2019s the right thing to save it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo suggest otherwise is to declare the child as being other than human.\u201d",
      "Setzler said the woman\u2019s relatives do have \u201cgood choices,\u201d including keeping the child or offering it for adoption.",
      "The situation echoes a case in Texas more than a decade ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on maintenance measures for about two months because she was pregnant. A judge eventually ruled that the hospital keeping her alive against her family\u2019s wishes was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.",
      "Twelve states are enforcing abortion bans at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Georgia is one of four with a ban that kicks in at or around six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Last year, the Texas Supreme Court ruled unanimously against a group of women who challenged that state\u2019s abortion ban, saying the exceptions were being interpreted so narrowly that they were denied abortion access as they dealt with serious pregnancy complications. This year, the state Senate has passed a bill that seeks to clarify when abortions are allowed.",
      "South Dakota produced a video to inform doctors about when exceptions should apply. Abortion rights groups have blasted it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in December over whether the federal law that requires hospitals to provide abortion in emergency medical situations should apply. A ruling is expected in coming months.",

      "New Jersey Transit is urging riders to reach their destinations or risk being stranded",
      "New Jersey Transit urged riders to reach their destinations before the end of the day Thursday or risk being stranded as talks continued in a bid to avert a rail strike by train engineers that would affect some 350,000 commuters who work in New Jersey and New York City.",
      "The advisory provided riders with details on contingency plans that would take effect if engineers walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. EDT Friday. The agency plans to increase bus service, saying it would add \u201cvery limited\u201d capacity to existing New York commuter bus routes in close proximity to rail stations and will contract with private carriers to operate bus service from key regional park-and-ride locations during weekday peak periods.",
      "However, the agency noted that the buses would not be able to handle close to the same number of passengers \u2014 only about 20% of current rail customers \u2014 so it is has urged people who can work from home to do so if there is a strike.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. A walkout would halt all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Wages have been the main sticking point of the negotiations between the agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union says its members earn an average salary of $113,000 a year and says an agreement could be reached if agency CEO Kris Kolluri agrees to an average yearly salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputes the union\u2019s data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",
      "If the walkout happens, it would be the state\u2019s first transit strike in more than 40 years. It comes a month after union members overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is hearing its first set of Trump-related arguments in the second Trump presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is hearing its first set of Trump-related arguments in the second Trump presidency. The case stems from the executive order President Donald Trump issued on his first day in office that would deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The executive order marks a major change to the provision of the 14th Amendment that grants citizenship to people born in the United States, with just a couple of exceptions.",
      "Immigrants, rights groups and states sued almost immediately to challenge the executive order. Federal judges have uniformly cast doubt on Trump\u2019s reading of the Citizenship Clause. Three judges have blocked the order from taking effect anywhere in the U.S., including U.S. District Judge John Coughenour. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can\u2019t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,\u201d Coughenour said at a hearing in his Seattle courtroom.",
      "The Supreme Court is taking up emergency appeals filed by the Trump administration asking to be able to enforce the executive order in most of the country, at least while lawsuits over the order proceed. The constitutionality of the order is not before the court just yet. Instead, the justices are looking at potentially limiting the authority of individual judges to issue rulings that apply throughout the United States. These are known as nationwide, or universal, injunctions.",
      "President Donald Trump is weighing in ahead of arguments in the birthright citizenship case today.",
      "Trump says in an online post that granting citizenship to people born here, long seen as a constitutional promise, makes the country look \u201cSTUPID\u201d and like \u201cSUCKERS.\u201d He incorrectly asserted the U.S. is the only country in the world with birthright citizenship. While not every country grants it, about 30 other countries do, including Canada.",
      "His executive order at the heart of today\u2019s case aims to end birthright citizenship for children born to people in the U.S. illegally, something many legal scholars say would require amending the Constitution.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer is representing the Trump administration in urging the court to allow Trump\u2019s restrictions on birthright citizenship to take effect in at least 27 states. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum is arguing on behalf of the states that say they\u2019ll lose millions of dollars in health and other benefits available to U.S. children and also have to overhaul identification systems since birth certificates will no longer serve as proof of citizenship. Kelsi Corkran is representing pregnant women and immigrant rights groups that say chaos will result if Trump\u2019s order takes effect anywhere.",
      "The justices will take the bench at 10 o\u2019clock Eastern time, but the livestream won\u2019t begin immediately. The court will issue at least one opinion before hearing arguments, so it could be 10 minutes before the Chief Justice John Roberts invites Solicitor General D. John Sauer to begin.",
      "The livestream will be available on the court\u2019s website, www.supremecourt.gov, or C-SPAN. C-SPAN asked Roberts to allow cameras to carry the case live, but he did not respond to the request, C-SPAN said. The Supreme Court has never allowed cameras in the courtroom.",
      "A decision should come relatively soon. The Supreme Court typically rules in all its argued cases by the end of June and this one shouldn\u2019t be any different. If anything, an order from the court might come quickly because the legal issue before the justices is not whether Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship restrictions are constitutional, but whether to grant the administration\u2019s emergency appeals to narrow lower court orders against it while lawsuits proceed.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Before \u201cAmerica First\u201d became the Trump administration\u2019s mandate for foreign policy and trade, one sector was already working to bring business back to the United States: the semiconductor industry.",
      "Aided by government incentives, American and foreign tech companies alike have invested hundreds of billions of dollars to bolstering semiconductor operations \u2014 research and development, manufacturing and facility modernization \u2014 across the country in recent years.",
      "In few places is the growth of the U.S. semiconductor industry clearer than in the Greater Sacramento region, where tech leaders and lawmakers have, for years, sought to grow California\u2019s role in producing the chips that power everyday necessities like cars, refrigerators and smartphones. Semiconductor giants clustered in cities just outside Silicon Valley \u2014 Intel, AMD, Bosch, Samsung and Micron \u2014 are building on a tech foothold Intel first established when it opened its Sacramento-County campus in 1984.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies have complicated that growth as the administration takes its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports and launching investigations into imports of computer chips and chip-making equipment \u2014 all at a time when deeper semiconductor investments were just starting to have a positive impact on changing supply chains. New tariffs, paired with the administration\u2019s threats against the CHIPS and Science Act, could dramatically slow its goal of ensuring the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in artificial intelligence development.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see some of it now. Samsung announced a delay in the fabs in Texas,\u201d said Mario Morales, an analyst with the International Data Corp. \u201cThat facility was supposed to come online in 2024 now it\u2019s being delayed to 2028. I think some of these companies are delaying it because they now know that they\u2019re not going to likely get funding, or because of the uncertainty around the acts that we\u2019re seeing around the new trade policy.\u201d",
      "Although the U.S. is a major producer of certain types of semiconductor chips, the nation's share of global chip production \u2014 measured by volume and not dollar value \u2014 fell from 37% in 1990 to just 10% in 2022, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. As a result, the country relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for advanced chips.",
      "Major manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. are investing to build up U.S. facilities, partly due to incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden\u2019s time in office. The CHIPS Act, a law passed in 2022 with bipartisan support, was designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing while sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and minimizing future supply chain disruptions.",
      "Because of the CHIPS Act, the U.S. is projected to more than triple its semiconductor manufacturing capacity \u2014 the highest rate of growth in the world during that period, according to a May 2024 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.",
      "Barry Broome, president of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council, said weaknesses in the semiconductor supply chain became evident during the pandemic, when the U.S. experienced a shortage in supply. It was \u201cabundantly clear that having these chip products offshore in Vietnam, Taiwan, China for cost savings had serious implications.\u201d",
      "Those pandemic-era challenges, paired with looming tensions between China and Taiwan, have helped drive the industry to the Sacramento area, he said. Northern California's wealth of tech knowledge and established roots in the semiconductor industry are also attractive traits that have brought investment to the Sacramento region as federal subsidies begin to bolster domestic growth.",
      "German tech company Bosch, for example, announced a $1.9 billion investment in the Greater Sacramento area in 2023 to manufacture chips for electric vehicles, converting its facility in Roseville into a silicon carbide semiconductor production site.",
      "That investment, Bosch said, would create as many as 1,700 jobs in construction, manufacturing, engineering, and research and development. The project marks the largest semiconductor investment in California in three decades, according to Broome.",
      "Tech workers who started out at companies like Intel have spun out companies of their own, including Sacramento-area AI startup Blaize and data storage manufacturer Solidigm.",
      "Dinakar Munagala, cofounder of Blaize, said the company\u2019s AI chips are among the few built domestically. Their chips are made in a Samsung foundry in Texas, he said. The company\u2019s products, Munagala added, help to power systems that analyze traffic patterns and detect suspicious behavior in airports.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re built here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re actually getting quite a bit of interest from defense, border security, these classes of use cases.\u201d",
      "Lane Bess, board chair of Blaize, pointed to Munagala \u2014 who worked at Intel \u2014 as an example of the talent the Sacramento region can provide to tech companies. The area is primed to be a main corridor for the semiconductor industry because a lot of skilled workers are looking to develop their own companies, Bess said.",
      "The Trump administration has viewed chip production as a national security issue because it would reduce U.S. reliance on importing chips that are also used by the military. It also intends to study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on U.S. competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, \u201cforeign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity.\u201d",
      "Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, said the fluidity of the state of administration's tariffs will cause confusion about the impact on the supply chain \u201cdue to the complexity of tracking where materials and manufactured goods are produced and assembled.\u201d",
      "Video game companies, for example, have started to raise prices amid a backdrop of ongoing tariff uncertainty.",
      "\u201cFor semiconductors, we may see certain goods no longer making sense to produce due to the cost \u2014 see Nintendo Switch 2 \u2014 and the value seen from IT purchases diminishing,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Preorders for Nintendo\u2019s highly anticipated Switch 2 were delayed in April as retailers assessed the potential impact of tariffs. Nintendo later confirmed that some Switch 2 accessories would see price adjustments, but maintained that its baseline price for the console \u2014 $449.99 \u2014 would remain the same.",
      "Nguyen said that in the medium term, the growth of foundries around the world will be beneficial to easing dependence on Taiwan for chip production. Down the road, \u201cwe should see a healthier global ecosystem for semiconductor manufacturing and more supply chain options in where chips are produced and can be procured,\u201d he said.",
      "Broome, of the economic council, said he believes the Trump administration's tariffs are aimed at restructuring global relationships. He said he hopes that \u201cconcludes quickly\u201d because uncertainty over trade policy doesn\u2019t favor the markets.",
      "\u201cIf the tariffs are used for leverage to get better agreements in the next two or three months, then we\u2019ll come back quickly, and will benefit from it,\u201d Broome said. \u201cIf they\u2019re considered long-term policy, I think it\u2019ll really ice the capital markets from putting real money on the table.\u201d",

      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",
      "The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process.",
      "\"It's something we plan many years out,\" he said.",

      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",

      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "It's not known who is ultimately using the service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.",

      "Since 2010, Dwr Cymru Welsh Water has been legally responsible for monitoring its water quality at its treatment plants and submitting its results to the regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "Upon receiving its 2020 annual report, NRW officers said they were alarmed to find that the quality of the information provided had noticeably deteriorated compared to previous years, as 676 offences took place in 2020 with a further 142 breaches in 2021.",
      "They all involved breaches of environmental permit licence due to samples not being taken in a timely way, or being incomplete or being submitted late or not at all.",
      "This meant any potential harm to water quality, wildlife and other amenities would not have been known.",
      "The locations included water treatment works at Bodedern, Llanfair PG, Pwllheli, Bethesda, Rhuddlan, Mold, Queensferry, Dyffryn Ardudwy, Elan Valley, Aberystwyth, Llandrindod Wells, Gowerton and Cardiff.",
      "\"Contingency plans should have been in place to ensure the company met their legal duty to comply with their permits while going through the restructure,\" NRW said.",
      "The court heard that NRW had expressed their concerns to Welsh Water about the information the company was presenting, but on numerous occasions it had not received a response.",
      "Welsh Water argued the number of offences accounted for a very small proportion of the total number of samples gathered during this time, the vast majority of which were recorded correctly.",
      "It said it was now almost 100% compliant with its statutory obligations.",
      "Judge Jones said there was no suggestion there was deliberate concealment of unlawful activity.",
      "Welsh Water was a massive organisation, he said, and the offences had happened during the operationally difficult time of the Covid pandemic.",
      "But there had been a lack of reporting which \"undermined\" the effectiveness and veracity of the self-reporting system.",
      "\"This was at a significant scale,\" said Judge Jones.",
      "The new system of self-reporting introduced following internal reorganisation at Welsh Water had not been stress-tested, said Mr Jones, which led to \"organisational failure\".",
      "Welsh Water was fined \u00a390,000 for each of the 15 specimen charges to which it had pleaded guilty, totalling \u00a31.35m.",

      "A Welsh Water spokesperson said it had a \"strong record of compliance\" with monitoring obligations prior to and after 2020-21 but a combination of factors affected its work, including the pandemic.",
      "\"Despite this we met our monitoring requirements, which involve more than 18,000 tests per year, 98.95% of the time in 2020 and 99.45% in 2021,\" they said.",
      "\"The monitoring failures represent a very small number of examples in a programme involving tens of thousands of submissions each year.\"",
      "No sites were left unmonitored during 2020-21, they said, and there was \"no identified\" environmental harm but they recognised compliance fell short.",
      "\"Welsh Water will continue to work closely with our regulators to ensure that we deliver on our two main priorities, the best possible service to our customers and protecting the environment,\" they added."

    "summary": "Investigators say 80mph winds \"violently\" knocked over the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
    "story": [
      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",
      "Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds at 04:06 am local time, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck.",
      "\"There was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,\" the report says.",
      "The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents Andrew Moll said the situation was \"irrecoverable\" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.",
      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",
      "The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK. No date has been set for when its final report will be published.",
      "It said its report was based on \"a limited amount of verified evidence\" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted access to the wreck.",
      "An operation to raise the 56-metre vessel from the seabed was paused over the weekend after a diver died while working on the wreck. Work was set to resume on Thursday.",
      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",
      "Two of the yacht's guests used furniture drawers \"as an improvised ladder\" to escape their cabin, it adds.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not like a car where you jump in and turn the key. It would take 5 or 10 minutes before you can start the engines with a vessel of this size.\"",
      "Survivors escaped on the Bayesian's life raft and were rescued by a small boat dispatched from another nearby yacht, the report says.",
      "Mike Lynch was a prominent figure in the UK tech industry, where his backing of successful companies led to him being dubbed the British equivalent of Microsoft founder Bill Gates.",
      "But the latter years of his life were consumed by a long-running legal dispute which resulted in him being controversially extradited to the US.",
      "Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer and his wife, Judy Bloomer, who were all British nationals.",
      "US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo also died in the sinking, along with Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as the yacht's chef.",

    "story": [
      "Qatar Airways has agreed to buy up to 210 jets from American manufacturing giant Boeing, according to US President Donald Trump, who announced the $96bn (\u00a372.4bn) order as part of his tour of the Middle East.",
      "The White House said the deal would support 154,000 jobs in the US each year of production and marked the largest-ever order of 787 Dreamliners, a wide-body jet used for longer flights.",
      "Qatar Airways and Boeing later confirmed the agreement.",
      "It is the second deal involving Boeing to be announced as part of Trump's trip, marking a win for the company as it tries to rebuild its business after a series of manufacturing and safety issues.",
      "The blow-out of a panel on one of its planes in January 2024 forced a dramatic slowdown in its manufacturing operations and sparked a more than $10bn loss last year.",
      "But shares in the company, which was also hurt by a seven-week strike by some of its workers, have climbed roughly 20% since January, an indication of increased optimism about the firm's prospects.",
      "Boss Kelly Ortberg told investors in April that the firm's recovery plan was in \"full swing\" after the firm delivered a greater-than-expected 130 aircraft in the first three months of the year.",
      "Executives said the firm still had a backlog of 5,600 planes, amounting to more than seven years of production.",
      "The Qatar Airways deal, which includes 130 Dreamliners, 30 777-9s and the option for 50 other planes, was part of more than $240bn in \"economic deals\" between the US and Qatar that the White House announced as part of the trip.",
      "It would deepen a longstanding relationship between Boeing and the state-owned airline, which already had 150 Boeing airplanes in its fleet and more than 130 jets on order, according to Boeing's website.",
      "\"It's the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing, that's good,\" Trump said at the signing \"So that's a record, Kelly, and congratulations to Boeing. Get those planes out there, get them out there.\"",
      "As part of Trump's trip, Boeing had previously announced it had won a commitment from Saudia Arabia's Avilease, which leases planes to airlines, to buy 20 737 MAX planes, with options for 10 more.",
      "British Airways owner IAG also said earlier this month that it had placed an order for 32 787-10 aircraft worth $13bn, a deal Trump previewed as part of his US-UK trade announcement. Those are set to start being delivered in 2028.",
      "The trade truce between the US and China has also helped to ease a challenge for the firm, whose customers in China had stopped accepting planes as tariffs escalated.",
      "Richard Aboulafia, managing director of US-based consultancy firm Aerodynamic Advisory, said the timing of the Qatar Airways order was \"politically savvy\" and a \"nice win\" for Boeing.",
      "However, he added: \"It doesn't indicate an accelerated need for aircraft or that Boeing has won any battle,\" noting that airlines often make orders for delivery dates far into the future.",
      "Boeing's problems in recent years have stemmed from the difficulty it has had meeting delivery deadlines - not a fall in demand.",
      "\"You can add more jets to the backlog - thank you Qatar Airways - but the problem for some time now, and it will continue to be a problem, is on the production side,\" he said. \"They need to build more planes.\"",

      "On Wednesday, as a deal to ease the trade war came into effect, Mr Wang said his US buyers were back on the phone.",
      "Both countries still face some tariffs. There is at least a 30% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US and Beijing has kept a 10% levy on American goods coming into the country, down from 125%.",
      "But this surprise agreement after a weekend of negotiations in Switzerland has given factories and businesses some breathing room.",
      "\"At this time, our US client is willing to pay for the tariffs. Of course, we had to bargain with them as they asked us to lower some of our costs,\" he said.",

      "Several nearby hostels offer rooms for 20 yuan a night, which can be at least an hour's pay. Many will want to pocket whatever they earn to send it back to their families.",

      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 04:01:38 GMT",
    "summary": "How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:03:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The US currently has no high-speed rail services, but two are under construction, and more planned.",
    "story": [
      "The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.",
      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",
      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",
      "Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will \"to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation\".",
      "He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. \"The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]\".",
      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",

      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",

      "With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.",
      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",

      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",
      "\"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:09:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says \"every single penny\" raised by the policy will be spent on state schools.",
    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Those that have a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names a specific private school that can meet their needs do not have to pay VAT.",
      "The government also said a grant to help cover the boarding school fees for children of military families was increased to take account of the VAT increase.",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Have private school fees gone up?",
      "The ISC represents more than 1,400 private schools. It said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024.",
      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

      "While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.",
      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"",
      "'Smuggling routes'",

      "In other words, Richard ducked onto the stage, guitar in hand, while the director cut to a wide shot, concealing his presence from viewers at home.",
      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",
      "If he announces \"stage not clear\" into his headset, the director can buy time by showing an extended shot of the audience.",
      "In the event of a bigger incident \u2013 \"a camera can break, a prop can fall\" \u2013 they cut to a presenter in the green room, who can fill for a couple of minutes.",
      "Up in the control room, a tape of the dress rehearsal plays in sync with the live show, allowing directors to switch to pre-recorded footage in the event of something like a stage invasion or a malfunctioning microphone.",
      "A visual glitch isn't enough to trigger the back-up tape, however - as Switzerland's Zo\u00eb M\u00eb discovered at Tuesday's first semi-final.",
      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",
      "And if all goes to plan, you won't see them at all this weekend."

    "summary": "BBC News speaks to psychologists about the line-up's likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

      "After getting her tracks played on Dean Jackson's BBC Introducing programmes, Rose has gone on to to perform at Derbyshire's Ynot? festival, Reading and Leeds festival, as well as opening a show for American singer-songwriter Noah Kahan in August 2024.",
      "\"It feels like it's been a whirlwind, it doesn't feel like so long ago since my first session at Nottingham's Metronome,\" she said.",
      "\"There are loads of incredible artists from the East Midlands and I'm so happy for myself and for other people that there is a way into the music industry.\"",
      "Since finishing her 2024 UK tour, Rose said she felt \"comfortable\" transitioning from performing at smaller venues to bigger stadiums.",
      "\"I have always joked about my own headline tour, because we had a lot of staging and effects, people said it felt like an arena show,\" she said.",
      "\"To now take my shows on to those actual incredibly-sized Dua Lipa stages, it's felt like a natural transition where I felt comfortable.",
      "\"Sometimes I've walked off stage and I said to myself why was I so calm, that was so huge and there were so many people out there.\"",
      "\"As I'm so happy and proud of what I get to do, the excitement overtakes all other feelings, I'm always so excited to be on stage.\"",
      "Away from the excitement on stage, Rose and her band have been enjoying some unusual pleasures whilst touring the world.",
      "Speaking from a hotel room in Lyon, France, she said: \"Me and the band are going to eat pasta downstairs and we have gained an obsession with pickleball.",
      "\"It's pickleball tomorrow and pasta tonight, that is the really glam life on tour with Dua Lipa.\"",
      "Rose said to tour with Dua Lipa and Tate McRae was \"so wild and ridiculous\".",
      "\"I've admired both of their music and their careers individually for so long,\" she said.",
      "\"I love Tate McRrae and I'm so grateful for her having me. It's an insane tour all across America. I can't believe that's a real sentence I'm saying.",
      "\"I have not met Dua Lipa yet, but we have spoken over Instagram messages. She is a delight and she is an incredible performer.",

      "She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then \"picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway\" to look for more jewellery,\" she said.",

      "She thought of her family at that point, offering them a \"prayer\" that they would not have to experience her killing.",
      "She expressed fear for her sister,  Kourtney, having to walk into the hotel room to find that \"I would be shot dead on the bed and she would see that and have that memory forever.\"",
      "When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: \"I absolutely did think I was gonna die.\"",

She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.",
      "The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.",
      "During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.",
      "Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.",
      "She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.",
      "\"Everything changed\" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a \"phobia of going out\" because she thought people would \"see me out and know my home was empty\".",
      "\"I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security\" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.",
      "Seeking closure",
      "Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.",
      "She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.",
      "She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '\"I Held Up Kim Kardashian\".",
      "Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was \"really shocked when I saw there was a book\".",
      "\"Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.\"",
      "She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.",
      "\"I wanted to be a part of today because I am a victim in this case and it's the first time I'm able to really hear from everyone and follow along,\" she said.",
      "\"This is what I do. I want to become a lawyer and I do believe everyone has the opportunity to speak their truth, and this is my closure and my opportunity to put this to rest after everything I've been through.\"",
      "Kardashian added that her job is \"to tell my truth and hope this doesn't happen to anyone else\".",
      "\"It was terrifying and life-changing and I don't wish that kind of terror on anyone - to think you could be killed or raped - I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.\""

    "story": [
      "Yuval Raphael never dreamt she'd be at Eurovision.",
      "The last major music event she attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, where she was nearly killed. On 7 October 2023, the singer fled the festival when Hamas gunmen started shooting.",
      "Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.",
      "\"It's something I deal with every day,\" she told the BBC. \"It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.\"",
      "On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.",
      "She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.",
      "But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.",
      "Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. \"Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,\" she said.",
      "\"Be quiet,\" he replied. \"Yuvali my daughter. Yuvali, breathe deep. Hide. Play dead.\"",
      "\"Bye,\" she said, thinking that was the end.",
      "Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.",
      "That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. \"I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,\" she says. \"To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.\"",
      "On Thursday, the 24-year-old will sing her song, New Day Will Rise, at the Eurovision semi-final with shrapnel still in her leg.",
      "The rules of the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 which is in charge of Eurovision \u2013 means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.",
      "The Israeli entrant has had to contend with protests about her country's participation in the song contest.",
      "Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.",
      "Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.",
      "More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.",
      "In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. \"Everybody has opinions,\" she said. \"I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.\"",
      "Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\".",
      "Nevertheless, Israeli fans have been warned by their country's National Security Council not to wear Jewish or Israeli symbols while attending Eurovision.",
      "On Sunday, during the Eurovision opening parade in the Swiss host city of Basel, the Israeli broadcasting delegation made a complaint to the police and the EBU after accusing a pro-Palestinian demonstrator of making a throat-slitting gesture and spitting at the delegation.",

      "\"It's definitely in the single digits,\" says singer Holly-Anne Hull, trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home. \"We don't have time for that.\"",
      "Instead, they've been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, meeting fans, filming endless TikToks and performing their song, What The Hell Just Happened, to anyone who'll listen.",
      "If they're tired, it doesn't show. The country-pop trio \u2013 Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele \u2013 are chatty, excited and focused on fun, and for good reason.",
      "They formed at school over a decade ago, and determinedly stayed together during long periods where, in their words, \"no-one was listening\".",
      "Even after a successful turn on The Voice in 2019, Charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher, while Lauren and Holly-Anne appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical.",
      "Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table.",
      "It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live.",
      "Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".",
      "It's eight weeks since you were announced as the UK's Eurovision entry\u2026",
      "Charlotte: No, it can't be. It feels like six years!",
      "How many air miles have you racked up in that time?",
      "Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint.",
      "Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side.",
      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",
      "Charlotte: I was smiling, talking. It's like I was cured!",
      "When I first heard What The Hell Just Happened, I thought it sounded like something from Six: The Musical\u2026 Then I discovered you'd actually been in it.",
      "Lauren: That was me! I was Jane Seymour. She's the one that died, instead of being beheaded.",
      "Was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song?",
      "Lauren: We wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references: Bohemian Rhapsody, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But we also said 'let's not be afraid to write the pop version of Defying Gravity'. We wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the West End tricks you don't get in pop music.",

      "Charlotte: It's so true, and funnily enough, What The Hell Just Happened was the last song we wrote, a day before the deadline. We'd got to the point where we were like 'let's just go 100% on every idea and see where it lands'.",
      "Holly-Anne: We thought we had the Eurovision Song, I would say, four or five times. Then this one came up and we were like 'OK, it's beaten all of them'.",

      "Holly-Anne: We come from theatre background, so it's definitely going to be theatrical. We want to give that a girl-band, concert feeling, like you're stepping into the world of Remember Monday.",
      "There's a line in the song about ripping your dress. Is that a sneaky Bucks Fizz reference?",
      "Lauren: Oh my God! Let's say yes. We didn't write it specifically with that in mind... but if the shoe fits!",
      "Charlotte: There's loads of little Easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship. We've had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow.",

      "Lauren: Then, maybe 18 months ago, we quit our jobs to do this full-time.",
      "Charlotte: We thought, if we don't throw everything in now, we'll always regret it.",

      "Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher.",
      "Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.",
      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",
      "Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together.",
      "Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime.",
      "Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough.",
      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",
      "Holly-Anne: Even if we get zero points, we'll still be singing together, even if it's in my living room.",
      "What's the one memory you'll take away from this?",
      "Lauren: I will always, always remember the feeling of finding out we'd represent the UK. We've been around for a long time, and we've had a lot of 'noes' as a band, so when we auditioned, we assumed this would be another one. 'Thank you so much, but we're going in another direction'.",

      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",

      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",

      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",

      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",

      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",

    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",
      "Last year Swiss winner Nemo did wave a non-binary flag during the performance, but said they had to 'smuggle' the flag in. This year LGBTQ+ groups say they are disappointed the EBU has not relaxed the rules.",
      "\"Banning our symbols is a slap in the face for the LGBTIQ community', said Swiss group Pink Cross. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when queer communities across Europe are facing increasing hostility.\"",
      "EBU has said that the guidelines were designed to create clarity and balance explaining: \"Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\"",
      "Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump's administration is actively removing government support for diversity and inclusion measures, and he is asking partnered European institutions (including some Swiss universities) to do the same.",
      "That's why Basel, says Mr Cramer, should take a stand, even if the EBU will not.",
      "\"These are our European values. People and nations are coming together in a friendly championship. Whoever you are, if you are young, if you are not that young, if you are straight, if you are gay, if you are female, male, or if you are non-binary, this is all perfectly fine. And I think this is not just what Basel stands for, this is what Europe should stand for.\"",
      "So if everyone is welcome, how do they get there? The host country being Switzerland, punctual transport is catered for. Swiss railways is laying on hundreds of extra trains. In Basel, the trams will run 24 hours a day.",
      "And, for those who are really in Eurovision mode, there is even a karaoke tram, where passengers can take a free 90-minute journey right across town, all the while singing their hearts out."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",

    "title": "What is Sean 'Diddy' Combs charged with and how long will his trial last?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 13:31:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The jury in the federal sex trafficking trial will be sworn in on Monday before opening statements are delivered.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of American music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is accused of running a sprawling sex trafficking operation, has heard opening statements.",
      "The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.",
      "Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.",
      "The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.",
      "Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How can I follow the trial?",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors the trial could last around eight weeks.",
      "How were jurors selected?",
      "Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court.",
      "The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.",
      "The \"People and Places\" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he \"felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings\".",
      "Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had \"views about hip hop artists\" or \"feelings concerning violence, sexual assault\".",
      "The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.",
      "Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.",
      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",
      "He apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"",
      "'He thought of himself as a king': The parties that led to Diddy's downfall'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "'He thought of himself as a king': The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music",
      "Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "What has Diddy said about the charges against him?",
      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail if he is found guilty?",
      "If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
      "Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses.",
      "They accused him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".",
      "A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head.",
      "How did 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs become successful?",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.",
      "His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.",
      "In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.",

    "summary": "Two Nobel prize-winning scientists worried about \"asymptomatic transmission\" between staff and patients.",
    "story": [
      "The government ignored an early warning by two Nobel prize-winning scientists that all healthcare workers should be routinely tested for coronavirus in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard.",
      "The advice came in a strongly-worded letter sent in April 2020 by the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, Sir Paul Nurse, and its research director, Sir Peter Ratcliffe, to the then health secretary Matt Hancock.",
      "NHS and care home staff were not offered Covid tests until November 2020 in England, unless they had symptoms of the disease.",
      "Matt Hancock is due to appear at the inquiry next week, along with other health ministers from the four nations of the UK.",
      "Giving evidence, Sir Paul, who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 2001, said it was \"disturbing\" that he did not receive a response to his concerns until July 2020.",
      "\"For the secretary of state to ignore a letter from two Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine for three months is a little surprising, I would say,\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\"",
      "It was likely that the decision not to routinely test NHS and care home staff led to an increase in infections and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic, he added.",
      "Hospitals and care homes",
      "In the first six months of Covid, there was a frantic drive to increase testing for the disease. Matt Hancock set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020 in England.",
      "By this time it had become clear to scientists across the world that Covid could be spread by people who had not developed symptoms, such as a cough or fever.",
      "Sir Paul Nurse, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and their colleague Dr Sam Barrell wrote to Mr Hancock on 14 April 2020 saying they had \"grave concerns\" about \"asymptomatic transmission\" between healthcare staff and patients.",
      "\"We advise you that all NHS trusts and healthcare providers should be required to set up surveillance systems for the regular testing of all healthcare workers and patients with immediate effect,\" the letter said.",
      "The scientists received a response on 6 July 2020, signed by a junior official in the Department of Health.",
      "That reply did not directly address the subject of healthcare workers, instead stating that testing was a \"key part\" of the government's strategy and that capacity was being \"rapidly expanded\".",
      "Lighthouse labs",
      "The Frances Crick Institute, headquartered in north London, is one of the largest biomedical research centres in the world.",
      "As Covid hit, a team of 300 volunteers started using the organisation's laboratory space and equipment to process Covid tests for dozens of hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in the local area.",
      "It had the capacity to carry out 4,000 tests a day and to increase that to 10,000 with more funding, according to Prof Nurse.",
      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",
      "The sixth part of the Covid inquiry, which looks at the performance of test, trace and quarantine systems across the UK, runs until the end of May."

    "story": [
      "MPs are calling for a change in the law to prevent benefit claimants from suffering harm at the hands of the government department that is meant to help them.",
      "Several people have died in recent years after failures by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs says new legislation and \"deep-rooted cultural change\" at the DWP are needed to protect vulnerable clients.",
      "A DWP spokesperson said the government was \"currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach\" which \"genuinely supports vulnerable people\".",
      "In recent years, the deaths of Errol Graham, Philippa Day and Kevin Gale have seen the DWP widely criticized for its handling of vulnerable clients.",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stoppedIn 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stopped",
      "In 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error",
      "Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "In Mr Gale's case, the coroner highlighted \"that current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms\".",
      "The inquest heard of the number and length of DWP forms that claimants were required to complete, the length of telephone queues for DWP advisers, and the requirement to travel long distances for appointments for people affected by mental health illness.",
      "Thursday's report, from the Work and Pensions Select Committee, reveals the deaths of at least 274 people have been investigated internally by the DWP in since April 2015.",
      "Such inquiries - Internal Process Reviews - are launched when there is an allegation that a case has been mishandled by the DWP which has potentially contributed to serious harm or a safeguarding concern.",
      "During the same period, 58 reviews were opened into cases where customers suffered harm - but the MPs said the scale of the failings was likely to be greater.",
      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",
      "\"We heard evidence that the process of engaging with the DWP... too often led to mental distress.",
      "\"Deep-rooted cultural change of the DWP is desperately needed to rebuild trust and put safeguarding at the heart of policy development.",
      "\"Introducing a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants for the department is a fundamental part of this.\"",
      "A new law, holding the secretary of state accountable for safeguarding clients, would ensure that everyone saw it as their responsibility to protect claimants, says the committee.",
      "'Nasty and traumatic'",
      "Carl, 44, a former roofer from Croydon, south London, said his first interaction with the DWP \"felt quite a nasty and traumatic experience\".",
      "He had struggled for 18 months with a degenerative back condition that had left him with mobility issues and constant pain, requiring strong painkillers.",
      "In 2018, after trying a variety of less manual roles, such as plastering and carpet fitting, he realised he could no longer hold down a job.",
      "He applied for universal credit, his first ever benefit application, which led to an appointment at his local job centre.",
      "Carl says the work coach was \"very dismissive and patronising\".",
      "\"He said: 'If you want money from us, you're going to have to jump through these hoops.'",
      "\"It almost felt like he was trying to imply that I was being dishonest and I was putting it on.",
      "\"It was a very uncaring response. I wanted support to get a non-manual job.\"",
      "'Absolutely life-changing'",
      "Shannon Johnstone, 28, who found herself sleeping rough about seven years ago before turning to the DWP for help, said the recommendations \"are going to be absolutely life-changing for people... if they're done right\".",
      "At the start of her claim, she remembers the DWP told her: \"We can't help with your homelessness,\" which she says was understandable but off-putting.",
      "She does not know if they referred her case to homeless organisations as she was never told. Now she welcomes the recommendation to include the views of people with lived experience in the design, planning and implementation of DWP policy.",
      "\"People who have gone through the system understand what it feels like to be interviewed by a [DWP] inspector,\" says Shannon who now works for the charity, Expert Link.",
      "\"They understand what it's like to gather lots of paperwork, so by including them in the design of the system, it's going to work so much better.\"",
      "In a statement, the DWP said the government was committed to protecting the people who use its services \"and fixing the broken welfare system we inherited so it works for those who need it\".",
      "\"That's why we are currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach and our reforms will improve people's lives and rebuild trust, by establishing an approach that genuinely supports vulnerable people.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was encouraging people to have their voices heard in the consultation and help build a system \"that works better for all\"."

      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",

      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die.

      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",

      "'A red line I would never cross'",
      "Dr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP.",
      "We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque.",
      "His religion is absolutely key to his views on assisted dying.",

      "\"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me.",
      "\"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\"",
      "He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death.",
      "Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later.",
      "Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying?",

      "\"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\"",
      "By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice.",

      "Ministers announced in March that the body responsible for overseeing the health service in England would go, with its functions brought into the Department of Health and Social Care.",
      "But the Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned about the uncertainty being caused and urged the government to set out a clear plan within the next three months.",
      "The government said the move would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and that detailed planning had started.",
      "Alongside the changes at a national level, the 42 local health boards responsible for planning services are also having to shed around half of their 25,000 staff.",
      "The MPs also raised concerns about the \"jaw-dropping\" amount of money lawyers are making from clinical negligence claims. Of the \u00a32.8bn paid out in 2023-24, nearly a fifth went on legal costs.",
      "It said this was unacceptable and more must be done to improve safety.",

      "For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.",
      "Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.",
      "The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.",
      "They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.",
      "By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.",
      "Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrooke's and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were \"really exciting\".",
      "\"It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer.  We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach.\"",
      "The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic.\"",

      "Currently patients are given olaparib for a year after surgery, whereas on the trial patients took the tablets over 12 weeks pre-surgery, and at half the dose.",
      "Prof Abraham said: \"From a cost perspective, it would save the NHS a considerable amount of money because it's a fraction of the time and dose of the drug.\"",
      "Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"While this research is still in its infancy, it is an exciting discovery that adding olaparib at a carefully-timed stage of treatment can potentially give patients with this specific type of breast cancer more time with their loved ones.\"",
      "Although the trial involved only women, Prof Abraham said the olaparib results would also apply to the much smaller number of men with the BRCA mutation who get breast cancer.",

      "Symone has been using weight loss injections for nearly a year. She says they have done what the diet industry could never do for her - free her from a life controlled by food.",
      "From a very young age, the 34-year-old could not switch off the constant noise in her head. When would her next meal come? What would it be? Would there be enough for her?",
      "\"The food noise was just so loud, it could be unbearable,\" she says. \"I have tried every single diet going - I've done Atkins, eating clean, SlimFast, Slimming World, meal-replacement shakes - you name it - I've done it and none of them worked for me.\"",
      "Several years ago, weighing 16st (102kg), she was one of the many millions who signed up to WeightWatchers, downloading the app and meticulously following its points plan, scanning in everything she ate and staying within her daily points budget.",
      "WeightWatchers attributes points to food and drink, stating that it uses a \"groundbreaking algorithm\" to assess their nutritional makeup and then uses a point system to inform its members which food is better to eat.",
      "But after a few weeks, Symone says she started to feel like she was being set up to fail.",
      "\"How could I lose weight long term if I had to follow this mad points system? Food is not measured in points - it's measured in calories, fat, macro nutrients.",
      "\"I felt trapped, and the more research I did, the more I educated myself, the more I thought this is not for me.\"",
      "The only thing that has ever worked in her quest to lose weight, she says, is weight loss injection Mounjaro, which she started using nearly a year ago.",
      "\"I was at my heaviest, just over 21 stone, and the doctor told me I was pre-diabetic. I knew something had to change - I've got two children who depend on me too.\"",
      "She was advised to start on the weight loss medication but with a two-year wait, she decided to buy it privately online and within just a few days, she was crying with relief.",
      "\"I couldn't believe that I had control over food. For the first time, I wasn't panicking about when I would next eat.\"",
      "Weight loss jabs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which suppresses people's appetites and makes them feel full.",
      "Symone has now lost 4st 7lb (26kg) and is losing weight gradually, documenting her experiences on social media.",
      "\"I don't want a quick fix,\" she says, \"I'm using weight loss injections to give me the control I never had.\"",
      "Lost a million members",
      "For many, weight loss jabs can produce rapid results, but some experts are concerned about the meteoric rise in their popularity and how people will be affected by them long term - both physically and mentally.",
      "At its peak, WeightWatchers was seen as being synonymous with safe and controlled weight loss. With 4.5million subscribers globally, its workshops were held in most towns, on most high streets, popping up in local church halls - they were everywhere.",
      "Now, after dominating the diet industry for more than half a century, it has lost more than a million members and filed for bankruptcy, struggling to compete in a market transformed by social media influencers and weight loss injections.",
      "The company has stressed that it is not going out of business and that filing for bankruptcy will help it resolve its debt of $1.25bn (\u00a3860m).",
      "In a statement, the brand says its weight loss programme (which also includes its own brand of weight loss jabs) and weight loss workshops will continue.",
      "The company says it has been the brand with the most scientific backing in the diet industry for over 60 years, and that there have been more than 180 published studies showing the effectiveness of its approach.",

      "\"None of these pharmaceutical interventions protect people from regaining the weight when they stop injecting.\"",

      "More holistic approach",
      "Dr Joanne Silver, lead psychologist at the London-based eating disorder clinic, Orri, agrees. She says the weight loss injections \"completely silence what the body is asking for\", which is counterintuitive to understanding what the body needs.",

      "They're here for their weekly check-in at the BeeWeighed slimming group. Some of the women have lost several pounds, others have a put on a pound or two, but overall, since joining the class, they have all lost weight.",
      "They are learning about how to eat in moderation, how to exercise safely and how to feel good about themselves.",
      "At first glance, it could be a WeightWatchers class \u2013 women meeting up to share their stories of weight loss and support each other \u2013 but there are crucial differences, says BeeWeighed owner and founder Lynda Leadbetter.",
      "She was a group leader for WeightWatchers for 18 years but left to set up her own group in 2018.",
      "\"I think WeightWatchers did provide something different and something hopeful for so many women but I think it has lost its way,\" she says.",
      "\"I teach nutrition, I educate, I don't sell anything extra. I feel WeightWatchers became about selling extra products, it was always about pushing those extra sales, and not about supporting people to lose weight properly.\"",

      "It's not quite worked out as she had hoped.",
      "\"I've been on Mounjaro for over a month now, and while I lost 6lb in the first week or so, I've put half of that back on.",

    "story": [
      "\"High-protein\" versions of snacks and food staples are all over our supermarket shelves - from pancakes and pasta, to rice pudding and oven pizza.",
      "Celebrities are getting in on the act too. Khloe Kardashian unveiled Khloud Protein Popcorn a fortnight ago, which she described as \"the perfect combination of a tasty snack and a boost of protein to fuel your day\", while Zac Efron promoted a protein-rich porridge in January.",
      "But is this increased advertising of protein just a marketing gimmick or are these products actually useful if you're trying to build muscle or live a healthy life? And is it worth the extra cost?",
      "Sales of them are rising; figures shared with BBC News by the research agency Mintel show that, excluding sports nutrition items, 8.3% of food product launches made claims about being a source of protein, or having high levels of it, in the first three months of 2025.",
      "That was up from 6.1% in 2024 and 4.6% the year before.",
      "Kiti Soininen, a research director at Mintel, says protein claims are being added to food with naturally high levels of the nutrient, like chicken breasts and pulses, but also on products you wouldn't expect.",
      "\"Mousses, desserts, granola, pancakes, even the odd pizza, are coming through with a high-protein claim,\" she says. \"Protein is enjoying a bit of a 'health halo' at the moment.\"",
      "Ethan Smith, a personal trainer in Liverpool, says high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle but that it ought to be done without the high protein snacks and drinks you see in shops.",
      "\"I'm a huge believer that there is nothing better than whole foods,\" he says. \"You can get the protein that you need from vegetables and lean meats.\"",
      "He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool.",
      "For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%.",
      "To help reach these scores they can add protein-rich ingredients to their products, like nuts and pulses, or make them more dense by removing water.",
      "\"When someone in a rush is getting a meal deal for lunch, you can see why they would reach for a protein bar or drink instead of two boiled eggs,\" he says. \"In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now.\"",
      "The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy.",
      "If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition.",
      "He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g.",
      "He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are \"gimmicky\" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised.",

      "Another issue is calories because putting on weight is the most common problem people have when they are trying to consume more protein, Dr Morgan explains, as any excess is stored in the body as fat.",
      "Some protein advertised snacks and drinks can have as many calories as regular products using similar ingredients.",
      "Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight.",
      "Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.",
      "Despite his concerns over ultra-processed protein products, Dr Morgan sees the benefit of increased protein in staple foods.",
      "These might be particularly useful to elderly people who need more protein than the average person to maintain strength in their muscles and bones.",
      "Tesco's high-protein penne pasta contains 8.8g of protein per 100g, while their normal penne contains 5.8g of protein for the same weight. However, customers pay more for this as the high protein-penne costs \u00a34.80 per kg. The normal penne costs \u00a31.29 per kg.",
      "So is it worth buying these protein advertised products?",
      "It might be if you're someone who needs more protein to maintain your health or if you're trying to build muscle and need just a little bit extra to meet your daily protein goal, says Ethan.",
      "\"If the majority of your diet is whole foods and you need that extra 20g of protein to hit your goal and want something sweet - then go for that pudding or snack,\" he tells us. \"Having balance is important - but you shouldn't be relying on them.\"",

    "story": [
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

      "The proposals would apply only to asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected and who had no further routes of appeal in the UK.",
      "It differs from the previous Conservative government's Rwanda scheme, which was scrapped by Sir Keir and involved sending migrants to have their asylum claims processed in the African country.",
      "Italy has a similar scheme, which involves sending failed asylum seekers to Albania while they await deportation, but that plan has been held up by legal action.",
      "Speaking at the news conference, Rama said the scheme was \"a one-off with Italy because of our very special relationship\".",

      "Immigration has been a strong focus of the government this week.",
      "On Monday, the government set out plans to reduce the level of legal migration in a White Paper.",

      "Lowe was elected as a Reform MP in last year's general election but was suspended by the party in March, amid claims of threats towards its chairman Zia Yusuf.",
      "In his Newsnight interview, Lowe said of Farage's \"brutal\" leadership style \"If people become, if you like, too tall a poppy, he tends to lop off the head of the poppy\".",
      "On Reform UK's leadership, Lowe said Farage has \"a team of what I call, very long-term lightweight sort of servants, which is what you tend to find in a cult.\"",
      "The independent MP added that he didn't think Farage is \"fit to be leader\".",
      "\"I think he's ultimately a very good, what I would call, ballroom entertainer. And he stands up and he entertains, and he's extremely good at that.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Malcolm McHaffie, head of the CPS, said it made the decision not to press charges on Mr Lowe \"following a thorough and detailed review of the evidence\".",

      "The proposals have also been criticised by Tory peer Baroness Newlove of Warrington, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, who said they would leave victims feeling \"unnerved and bewildered\".",
      "\"I find it difficult to understand why this specific group of offenders has been targeted for early release,\" she added in a statement on Thursday.",
      "The government estimates that the plans, which will apply in England and Wales, will free up around 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time ahead of a wider review of sentencing due shortly.",
      "The review, led by former Conservative minister David Gauke, is expected to recommend more community-based sentencing to reduce the long-term reliance on imprisonment.",

      "He argued the changes to recall were necessary to avoid a \"managed breakdown of the criminal justice system,\" blaming the previous government for not building enough prisons during its 14 years in power.",
      "The 28-day detention limit would apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released after serving their minimum period but then recalled for breaching their licence, such as by not sticking to their curfew.",
      "Those subject to a standard recall would otherwise have to wait for the Parole Board to decide when they can be re-released, a process the government says is taking months amid backlogs in the system.",
      "Ministers say the fixed limit will not apply to the highest-risk violent and sexual offenders, or those who are recalled for committing serious further offences.",
      "It will require new legislation to take effect, which ministers are expected to table in the coming weeks.",
      "The number of recalled prisoners has increased in recent years and they now make up around 15% of the 88,087 prison population, from a useable operational capacity of 89,442.",
      "Last year the Labour government implemented an early release scheme drawn up under the previous government, shortly after taking office.",
      "That scheme, under which qualifying prisoners were let out after serving 40% rather than 50% of their total sentence, saw more than 16,000 offenders released early during the final three months of last year.",
      "The government says that as well as changes to sentencing, a long-term plan to ease overcrowding will also require more prisons to be built.",
      "It has confirmed it wants to start work on three new prisons before the end of this year, and \u00a34.7bn will be allocated for prison-building between 2026 and 2031 at the government spending review, due next month."

      "The driver told the BBC Lammy should have paid more than a standard fare because he is a British government minister, making the journey more \"risky\".",
      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC there were no sensitive documents or laptops in the car and the foreign secretary had been travelling on his own personal passport, rather than a diplomatic one.",
      "The FCDO strongly disputes the taxi driver's version of events.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"The fare was paid in full.",

      "More than a thousand inmates will be released early to free up spaces in prisons in England and Wales, the justice secretary has announced, as the government grapples with an overcrowding crisis.",
      "Under the move, offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licences, will be released after 28 days.",
      "Shabana Mahmood said a \u00a34.7bn investment would fund more prisons, but said it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\".",
      "A senior Ministry of Justice (MoJ) official said the government would \"run out of prison places in just five months' time\" if action was not taken.",
      "Bold spending needed to halt prison crisis - union",
      "Ministers to consider scrapping short jail terms",
      "Plea for urgent action after prison officer attacks",
      "Last week, the prisons minister told the BBC there would be no more emergency releases to deal with the overcrowding crisis in prisons.",
      "But Mahmood said the move would free up about 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time to overhaul a system \"on the brink of collapse\".",
      "The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said.",
      "In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments.",
      "The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks.",
      "Mahmood warned that despite plans to start work on three prisons this year, it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\" and the government otherwise faced running out of spaces for male offenders by November.",
      "The latest prison-building initiative will be funded by a capital investment of \u00a34.7bn over the five years after 2026.",
      "Three prisons will be built, with work starting on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year, Mahmood added.",
      "A fourth prison, HMP Millsike near York, opened earlier this year.",
      "Changes from an upcoming review of sentencing, led by former Conservative minister David Gauke, were only likely to be felt from spring next year, she added.",
      "Amy Rees, the MoJ's interim permanent secretary, said that on the government's \"current trajectory\"  England would \"entirely run out of prison places for adult men, in November of this year.\"",
      "The number of recalled prisoners has increased in recent years and they now make up 13,583 inmates from a total prison population of 88,087.",
      "This is only 1,355 spaces short of the total useable operational capacity of 89,442.",
      "It is estimated to increase to between 95,700 and 105,200 by March 2029, according to government analysis released last year.",
      "The changes announced on Wednesday would apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released after serving their minimum period but recalled for breaching their terms of their licence, such as not sticking to their curfew.",
      "The scheme will not include those who have been sent back in for reoffending.",
      "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the announcement was \"failing to protect the public\".",
      "He said \"to govern is to choose, and today she's chosen to release early criminals who've reoffended or breached their licences.\"",
      "The chairman of the Prison Officers Association said building new prisons will \"not improve the current population crisis\".",
      "\"The government would be better off spending billions of taxpayers' money on modernising the prison estate, funding an under-resourced probation service, providing more secure mental health beds and ensuring we have robust community sentences that the public have confidence in,\" Mark Fairhurst said.",
      "One victim, whose perpetrator was recalled for breaching their restraining order, said the move was \"outrageous\" and meant some criminals would be given an easy way out without doing their time.",
      "Domestic Abuse Commissioner Dame Nicole Jacobs said the proposal lacked consideration for victims' safety and put lives in danger.",
      "\"You are not sent to prison for four years if you do not pose significant risk to your victim or the wider public,\" she said. \"Perpetrators of domestic abuse know everything about their victim \u2013 where they live, where they work, where their children go to school \u2013 they are also extremely willing to breach orders intended to protect victims, time and time again.",
      "\"Re-releasing them back into the community after 28 days is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "The announcement comes just weeks before Gauke's independent sentencing review will publish its proposals on how to deal with the overcrowding.",
      "It is understood it is likely to recommend more community based sentencing to reduce the reliance on imprisonment.",
      "Last summer, thousands of offenders were released early just days before prisons were expected to run out of places.",
      "According to government documents, between September and December 16,231 prisoners were released on licence under a scheme announced last year to let out offenders after serving 40% rather than 50% of their sentence.",

      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",

      "\"On one level you could say, well, accountability is occurring because these criminals are facing the full force of the law,\" she said.",
      "\"But the way that this scandal has played out asks a bigger question, which is that you might be getting accountability and justice through the criminal justice system, [but] it doesn't feel like proper accountability and justice for all of the victims.",
      "\"And that's because there is still [an] outstanding question of why so many people maybe looked the other way, or why this wasn't picked up and given the prominence that was needed, and so that's why justice might technically have been delivered --  But there's still a moment of reckoning to come.\"",
      "Prof Jay's seven-year investigation found tens of thousands of victims had been failed by institutions across the country, including in children's services and the police.",
      "Mahmood said these institutional failures had caused \"such visceral pain and a total shattering of trust in people who should have done a better job locally\".",
      "\"Whether local authorities, children's services, police officers, all sorts of people you would feel you can trust, and that trust has been fundamentally shaken, if not totally broken, in some of these places,\" she said.",
      "\"There is that need for reckoning. I hope I'm not overstating it as truth and reconciliation, but in my mind, that's what it feels like is needed.\"",
      "The national audit by Baroness Casey will look at the scale, nature and profile of grooming gangs, including offender characteristics, after Prof Jay found \"widespread failure\" to record the ethnicity of perpetrators, many of whom are of Pakistani-heritage, due to concerns around racism.",
      "The government has also announced specific support for five local inquiries in areas like Oldham, but it has resisted pressure from political opponents and some victims to commission another full national inquiry, saying its focus is on implementing recommendations made by Prof Jay's 2022 report.",

      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",

      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",

      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",

      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",

      "During the debate, Duncan-Glancy told parliament she was \"deeply worried\" about the consequences of legalising assisted dying, which she said could put disabled people at risk.",
      "The Glasgow MSP said she feared it could become \"easier to access help to die than help to live\".",
      "She warned the bill could \"legitimise a view that a life like ours, one of dependence and often pain, is not worth living\".",
      "Others opposed to assisted dying, including former first minster Nicola Sturgeon, have raised concerns about the potential for \"coercion\" and warned the definition of a terminal illness was too broad.",
      "Ex-Tory leader Douglas Ross echoed concerns that the legislation would lead to a so-called slippery slope, fearing that access to assisted dying would widen over time.",
      "McArthur insisted the bill would impose \"strict eligibility criteria\" and that fears of a \"slippery slope\" had been raised in countries where assisted dying had since been successfully introduced.",
      "Responding to concerns about disabled people, he said: \"Denying dying Scots more choice will not enhance the lives of those with a disability.",
      "\"Nor do I believe would it be acceptable for a person with a disability who meets the eligibility criteria under my bill to be denied the same choice as anyone else.\"",
      "In the assisted dying bill making its way through Westminster, a terminally ill person is defined as someone who has less than six months to live.",
      "The Scottish bill, meanwhile, does not have a life expectancy timescale. It instead refers to an advanced and progressive disease that is expected to cause premature death.",
      "McArthur acknowledged concerns about the definition, but said he does not believe it should include life expectancy, citing advice from medical experts.",
      "MSPs will be able to further scrutinise the bill at stage two, where they can also propose changes.",
      "Another vote on the final draft of the bill would need to be held before it could become legislation.",
      "Humanist Society chief executive Fraser Sutherland welcomed \"a major step forward towards choice and compassion at the end of life in Scotland\".",
      "Ally Thomson, director of Dignity in Dying Scotland, called the vote a \"watershed moment for compassion\".",
      "But Dr Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of Care Not Killing, said there remained \"massive opposition\" to the bill.",
      "Stuart Weir, head of Christian charity CARE for Scotland, said the organisation was \"deeply saddened\" by the news, adding: \"Our thoughts are with disabled Scots and many others who will be feeling great anxiety.\"",
      "The most recent Holyrood vote on assisted dying, in 2015, was defeated at stage one by 82 votes to 36.",
      "That bill was tabled by the late independent MSP Margo MacDonald, who died in 2014 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.",
      "It was a passionate and respectful debate with deeply personal experiences informing the arguments for and against.",
      "Holyrood has rejected assisted dying on two previous occasions, most recently in 2015, but at this third time of asking MSPs have given their approval in principle.",
      "Those promoting the legislation were pleasantly surprised to discover that support for the bill was even stronger than they had anticipated.",
      "It is worth noting that a number of those who backed the bill still have deep reservations and want to see that their concerns can be addressed in the next stage of debate.",
      "There are likely to be significant changes to Liam McArthur's current proposals before a final vote in the coming months.",
      "This is not the last word on this issue and campaigners on both sides still have much work to do to shape opinion on whether terminally ill patients should be able to seek medical help to end their lives.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?"

    "summary": "The PM knows cutting immigration is crucial to his credibility, political editor Chris Mason writes.",
    "story": [
      "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things.",
      "Firstly, as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century.",
      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",
      "There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here \u2013 and huge numbers turned up.",
      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",
      "The arguments over immigration are one of them \u2013 and what I have just set out tells you why.",
      "This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch.",
      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\"",

      "In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses \u2013 can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad?",
      "Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth.",

      "Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.",
      "Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.",
      "That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now.",
      "And there is another thing going on here too.",
      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",
      "By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan \u2013 meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here.",
      "Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration \u2013 because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited.",
      "But you can be certain there will be a row about it.",
      "These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.",

      "The prime minister said measures in the white paper, a blueprint for future laws, would make the system \"controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",
      "Lower qualification requirements will remain on a \"time limited basis\" for sectors deemed to be facing long-term recruitment issues.",
      "What this means in practice is not yet clear, with the government's migration advisory body tasked with recommending roles for inclusion.",
      "Lower-qualification visas will be capped and restricted to employers with a workforce training plan in place, whilst those applying will also face extra restrictions on bringing their dependants to the UK.",
      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",
      "Home Office urged to record migrant exits from UK",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Care visa scrapped",
      "A dedicated visa for social care workers introduced during the Covid pandemic will close to new applicants next month.",
      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",
      "The government says it expects this to be passed on to international students in the form of higher fees, reducing applications by 7,000 per year.",
      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",
      "Family rights reviewed",
      "The government says it will table legislation to \"clarify\" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases.",
      "It also says Parliament will be able to adopt a \"framework\" aiming to limit the extent to which family rights can be used to delay the removal of people without the right to stay in the UK.",
      "No overall cap",

      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",

      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",

      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",

      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",

      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "Wounded orangutan seen using plant as medicine",
      "Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was \"a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene\".",
      "\"Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,\" she explained. \"The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.\"",
      "The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.",
      "They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, \"because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy\".",
      "Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.",
      "This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s \u2013 local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.",
      "There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs.",
      "There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.",
      "This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.",
      "Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.",
      "Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.",
      "\"The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,\" Dr Freymann told BBC News.",
      "\"If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.\"",

      "Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades.",
      "The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - \"most likely\" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday.",
      "It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere.",
      "It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.",
      "While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,\" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.",
      "Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.",
      "Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "The group then demanded $20m from Coinbase to keep it quiet - but it refused to pay the bribe and instead promised to pay back every person who got scammed.",

      "Ransomware is a kind of attack where hackers scramble computer systems and demand payment from victims in exchange for handing back control.",

    "story": [
      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",

      "The top US diplomat Marco Rubio has said the US is \"troubled\" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.",
      "His comments came as at least 114 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, health officials said.",
      "Asked by the BBC if the Trump administration remained fully behind the nature of Israel's military action given the scale of the recent Israeli attacks and its bombing of hospitals, he once again called on Hamas to surrender and release hostages and said there could be no peace so long as the group exists.",
      "\"That said, we're not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there's opportunities here to provide aid for them,\" he said.",
      "Gaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. Israeli forces have been intensifying their bombardment of what they say are Hamas fighters and infrastructure ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.",
      "Rubio's comments - made after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Turkey - appeared to be a reference to a controversial Israeli-American proposal to use private providers to set up aid collection points in Gaza. That plan has been rejected by the UN as unethical and unworkable",
      "They come as Donald Trump is visiting the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.",
      "Hamas meanwhile accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \"undermin[ing] mediation efforts by deliberate military escalation\".",
      "An Israeli government spokesman said Israel wanted negotiations on hostage releases to succeed, but that they would take place while Hamas was under \"military pressure\".",

      "Some 56 people, including women and children, were killed when homes and tents sheltering displaced families were bombed overnight in the city, the local Nasser hospital said.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in southern Gaza.",
      "One man told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme that Nasser hospital's mortuary was \"filled beyond capacity\", and that several bodies had to be placed in the corridor before they could be buried.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x395pvvjo",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 23:43:30 GMT",
    "summary": "The first UK-EU summit since Brexit takes place on Monday - but is it a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives fear, or could it be, as Starmer puts it, an example of \"serious pragmatism\"?",
    "story": [
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

      "Motown legend Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation in Los Angeles over accusations of sexual assault.",
      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed it had launched a formal inquiry into the allegations, saying the probe was in the \"early stages\".",
      "The investigation comes after a lawsuit was filed last week by four anonymous housekeepers against the 85-year-old singer-songwriter, accusing him sexual battery, false imprisonment, negligence and gender violence.",
      "Mr Robinson has denied the allegations. His lawyer has said those behind the accusations are after the musician's money, and he welcomed the police investigation \"because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing\".",
      "\"We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,\" the attorney, Christopher Frost, said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "He argued the police investigation was only opened because the plaintiffs filed a formal report with their allegations and said the claims were \"manufactured\" and designed to \"tarnish the good names\" of the musician and his wife, who is also named in the lawsuit and accused of contributing to a hostile work environment.",
      "The sheriff's department told the BBC in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau was \"actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA 'Smokey Robinson.' The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.\"",
      "The women filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.",
      "In the 27-page legal action, they allege several incidents that they say dated back to 2006, and accuse Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.",
      "All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihoods, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status.",
      "They are seeking at least $50m (\u00a338m) in damages and a jury trial.",
      "Mr Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one records like Mary Wells' My Guy and The Temptations' My Girl.",
      "He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown.",
      "He has spots in both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs.",
      "The women's lawyers held a press conference last week after filing the lawsuit, accusing Mr Robinson of being a \"serial and sick rapist\" who \"must be stopped\".",

    "story": [
      "There has been a sharp rise in plots by the Iranian regime to kidnap or assassinate dissidents, journalists and political foes living abroad, according to reports by Western intelligence agencies.",
      "These attempts have escalated dramatically since 2022, with even US President Donald Trump among the alleged targets. In the UK, police are questioning a number of Iranians arrested earlier this month on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack. The BBC understands the alleged target was the Israeli embassy in London.",
      "And court documents from Turkey and the US - seen by BBC Eye Investigations and BBC Persian - contain evidence that Iran has been hiring criminal gangs to carry out killings on foreign soil, allegations the Iranian regime has previously denied. Iranian officials did not respond to a fresh request for a comment.",
      "One name repeatedly surfaced in these documents: Naji Sharifi Zindashti, an Iranian criminal boss, known for international drug smuggling.",
      "His name appeared in a Turkish indictment in connection with the 2017 killing in Istanbul of Saeed Karimian, the head of a Persian TV network that broadcast Western films and programmes to Iran.",
      "Iranian authorities considered Karimian a threat to Islamic values, and three months before his assassination an Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison.",
      "US and Turkish officials believed his death was related to a mafia feud.",
      "But when in 2019, Massoud Molavi, a defector from Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), was gunned down in Istanbul, it shed light on Zindashti's alleged role in Karimian's assassination.",
      "Molavi had been exposing corruption at the highest levels of Iran's leadership. The Turkish police discovered Zindashti's gardener had been present at the scene of Molavi's assassination, and that his driver had been at Karimian's murder.",
      "The police suspected the gardener and the driver had been sent by Zindashti.",
      "Zindashti was arrested in connection with Karimian's death but was controversially released after just six months, causing a legal scandal in Turkey.  A Higher Court judge ordered his rearrest but by then he had left the country.",
      "He then fled to Iran, raising suspicions that he might have been working for Iranian intelligence all along.",
      "Cengiz Erdinc, a Turkish investigative journalist, claims that when those out of favour with the Iranian regime are killed, Zindashti's men are at the scene. \"It is not the first time, but there has always been a connection between organised crime and the intelligence agencies,\" he says.",
      "Over three decades ago, he was convicted of drug smuggling in Iran and sentenced to death. But rumours suggested his escape from prison, which led him to Turkey, may have been orchestrated by Iranian intelligence.",
      "\"If someone sentenced to death in Iran escapes after killing a guard, they're unlikely to make it out alive - unless there's more to the story,\" says someone who knew Zindashti closely. The BBC is withholding their identity for their own safety.",
      "\"The only plausible way for him to return and live freely would be if he had been working for Iran's intelligence services, making his escape appear to be part of a planned cover story for intelligence work with Iran's security agencies and IRGC,\" they told BBC World Service.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "In 2020, Zindashti's name appeared again in a Turkish indictment in connection with the kidnapping of Habib Chaab, an Iranian dissident who was lured to Istanbul, abducted, and later paraded on Iranian state TV.",
      "Chaab was sentenced to death and executed. Zindashti's nephew was arrested in Turkey in connection with Chaab's disappearance. Zindashti has denied having any role.",
      "Then, in 2021, Zindashti was implicated in a plot in the United States. According to Minnesota court documents, communications between Zindashti and a Canadian with a full-patch member of the Hells Angels criminal gang, were logged in the indictment.",
      "Zindashti allegedly offered $370,000 to have two Iranian defectors assassinated in Maryland. The FBI intervened and arrested two men before the attack could be carried out.",
      "Our investigation into court documents also uncovered that the IRGC and its overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, have been working with criminal organisations like the Thieves-in-Law, a notorious international criminal gang from the former Soviet Union, to carry out kidnappings and assassinations.",
      "US and Israeli intelligence sources say Unit 840 of the IRGC's Quds Force's main responsibility is to plan and establish terror infrastructure abroad.",
      "In March, a New York jury convicted two men associated with the Thieves-in-Law for plotting to assassinate Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American activist. Iranian agents allegedly offered $500,000 for her killing. Just two years earlier, a man with a loaded gun had been arrested near her home in Brooklyn.",
      "Following the 2020 assassination by the US of top IRGC commander General Qasem Soleimani, Iran vowed revenge. Since then, the US says Iran has been plotting to kill former members of the Trump administration involved in Soleimani's death, including former national security adviser John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo, former head of the CIA and secretary of state.",
      "During last year's US presidential election, prosecutors accused Iran of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump, which Iran strongly denied.",

      "\"When they realised they couldn't attach a bomb to my car, the agents told the man to finish the job quietly,\" says Sima, who has seen the police file, says. \"He asked how quietly, and they replied, 'As quiet as a kitchen knife.'\"",
      "After the assassination of four Iranian Kurdish leaders by masked gunmen in a restaurant in Berlin in 1992, German prosecutors blamed the entire Iranian leadership for the killings. The attack was carried out by Iranian agents and members of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement.",
      "An international arrest warrant was issued for Iran's intelligence minister, and a court declared that the assassination had been ordered with the knowledge of Iran's Supreme Leader and president.",
      "Since then, it seems the Iranian regime has been hiring criminal organisations to carry out kidnappings and killings in an attempt to avoid linking the attacks back to the regime.",
      "But Matt Jukes, the UK's Head of Counter Terrorism Policing, says it is relatively easy for police to infiltrate criminal groups because they are not ideologically aligned with the Iranian regime.",
      "It is what he calls a \"creeping penetration\" by Iran, which the police are trying to disrupt."

      "He argued the current system \"required judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions\".",
      "Sauer proposed class-action lawsuits - which allow large numbers of plaintiffs to sue together - as one potential alternative. However, justices and Sauer's opponents noted that this process was time-consuming and did not provide relief in emergency circumstances.",
      "The justices grilled Sauer for over an hour, with liberal Justice Elena Kagan noting that the administration had lost on the birthright citizenship issue in every lower court. \"Why would you ever take this case to us?\" she asked.",
      "Another liberal justice, Sonia Sotomayor, made the comparison with gun ownership, saying if any future administration wished to remove people's guns, the courts would be powerless to stop them.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, one of the court's most prominent conservatives, appeared critical of the lower court's power to issue nationwide injunctions.",
      "\"Sometimes they're wrong,\" he said, adding that some lower court judges were \"vulnerable to an occupational disease, which is the disease of thinking that I am right, and I can do whatever I want.\"",
      "Feigenbaum, arguing on behalf of states alleging harm from the executive order, said siding with the Trump administration on this matter would be impractical and unconstitutional.",
      "Eliminating the option for nationwide injunctions could create a patchwork citizenship system, he argued, where an individual could have status in one state, but lose it when crossing into another.",
      "Feigenbaum said this standard would have a harmful impact on distribution of government benefits like Medicaid, immigration enforcement, and maintaining accurate statistics.",
      "\"Since the 14th Amendment, our country has never allowed American citizenship to vary based on the state in which someone resides,\" Feigenbaum said.",
      "As the justices lobbed questions at the lawyers, a large group of protesters gathered outside to voice opposition to Trump's immigration policies.",
      "Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, joined the demonstrators outside and read from the US Constitution.",

      "Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?",
      "It is unusual for the Supreme Court to hold a hearing in May, and there is no indication of when it may rule. Trump appointed three of the nine justices on the conservative-majority court in his first term.",
      "Many legal experts say the president does not have the power to end birthright citizenship because it is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. So, even if Trump wins the current case, he may still have to fight off other legal challenges.",
      "Specifically, the 14th Amendment stipulates that \"all persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens\".",
      "In the executive order, Trump argued that the phrase \"jurisdiction thereof\" meant that automatic citizenship did not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants, or people in the country temporarily.",
      "Federal justices in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington, however, issued nationwide - or universal -  injunctions that blocked the order from being enforced.",
      "The injunctions, in turn, prompted the Trump administration to argue that the lower courts exceeded their powers.",
      "The case being heard in the Supreme Court stems from three separate lawsuits, both from immigration advocates and 22 US states.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the court to rule that the injunctions can only apply to those immigrants named in the case or to the plaintiff states - which would allow the government to at least partly carry out Trump's order even as legal battles continue.",
      "Nearly 40 different court injunctions have been filed since the beginning of the second Trump administration, according to the justice department.",
      "In a separate case, two lower courts blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a military transgender ban, although the Supreme Court eventually intervened and allowed the policy to be enforced.",
      "An end - even a partial one - of birthright citizenship could impact tens of thousands of children in the US, with one of the lawsuits arguing that it would \"impose second-class status\" on a generation of people who were born, and have only lived, in the US.",
      "Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that a potential end of birthright citizenship could force some of these children to become undocumented or even \"stateless\".",

    "story": [
      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",
      "Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds at 04:06 am local time, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck.",
      "\"There was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,\" the report says.",
      "The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents Andrew Moll said the situation was \"irrecoverable\" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.",
      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",
      "The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK. No date has been set for when its final report will be published.",
      "It said its report was based on \"a limited amount of verified evidence\" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted access to the wreck.",
      "An operation to raise the 56-metre vessel from the seabed was paused over the weekend after a diver died while working on the wreck. Work was set to resume on Thursday.",
      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",
      "Two of the yacht's guests used furniture drawers \"as an improvised ladder\" to escape their cabin, it adds.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not like a car where you jump in and turn the key. It would take 5 or 10 minutes before you can start the engines with a vessel of this size.\"",
      "Survivors escaped on the Bayesian's life raft and were rescued by a small boat dispatched from another nearby yacht, the report says.",

      "US President Donald Trump's claim that India has offered to drop all tariffs on goods imported from his country has been swiftly disputed by Delhi.",
      "In a statement to local news agencies India's foreign minister S Jaishankar countered the claim saying talks are still going on and \"nothing is decided till everything is\".",
      "The statement is in stark contrast to comments by Trump to reporters earlier in the day, when he declared Delhi had \"offered us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariff\".",

      "Jaishankar said on Thursday that any trade deal has to be mutually beneficial and  work for both countries.",

      "The US president made the comments while speaking about Apple's plans to make iPhones in India, saying he had told CEO Tim Cook that he didn't want him to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"They [India] have offered us a deal where basically they have agreed to charge us literally no tariffs.

      "The US was until recently India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to $190bn (\u00a3143bn).",
      "Delhi has already lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products, but the US has a $45bn trade deficit with India, which Trump wants to reduce.",
      "\"As Trump always blamed India's high tariffs for the trade deficit, India could offer to make 90% of US exports tariff-free from day one, using a \"zero-for-zero\" approach - cutting tariffs on all goods except autos and agriculture. But the deal must ensure strict reciprocity, with both sides eliminating tariffs equally,\" says Ajay Srivastava, a Delhi-based trade expert.",
      "Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double trade to $500bn, but Delhi is unlikely to offer concessions in sectors such as agriculture where there are deeper political sensitivities involved.",

      "It was a very Trump gloss about Sharaa's old links to al-Qaeda. His Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016. HTS is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK.",

    "summary": "Experts tell the BBC the air strikes showcase the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Paramilitary fighters appear to have opened a new phase in Sudan's civil war after being driven from the capital, in a move which some experts have described as a \"shock and awe campaign\".",
      "Just weeks after the army celebrated the recapture of Khartoum, its foe the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a series of unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan in the east of the country.",
      "The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages.",
      "\"It's a level of power projection within this region that we haven't seen yet,\" says Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa expert for the International Crisis Group.",
      "\"I think it raises the stakes quite a bit,\" he added.",
      "The barrage of attacks on the war-time capital and humanitarian hub signals that the RSF is determined and able to carry on the fight despite significant territorial losses.",
      "And it has showcased the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.",
      "Drones have played an increasing role in the conflict, which has entered its third year.",
      "The war began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF and has drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) helped the army advance earlier this year. And the RSF escalated its own use of drones as it was pushed out of central Sudan, especially Khartoum, back towards its traditional stronghold in the west of the country.",
      "In recent months the paramilitaries had stepped up drone strikes on critical civilian infrastructure in army-controlled areas. That continued on Wednesday night with attacks on three power stations in the city of Omdurman, which lies across the Nile River from Khartoum. The damage has caused widespread electricity outages in the capital region.",
      "But it was the RSF's sustained strikes on Port Sudan, until now seen as a safe haven home to government officials, diplomats and humanitarian organisations, that underlined a shift in strategy to a greater emphasis on remote warfare, and aimed to demonstrate strength.",
      "\"The RSF is trying to show that they don't need to reach Port Sudan by land in order to be able to have an impact there,\" says Sudanese political analyst Kholood Khair.",
      "The group is trying to achieve a \"narrative shift\" away from \"the triumphant SAF that took over Khartoum,\" she says.",
      "\"It is saying to the Sudanese Armed Forces: 'You can take Khartoum back, but you'll never be able to govern it. You can have Port Sudan, but you won't be able to govern it, because we will cause a security crisis for you so large that it will be ungovernable'... They want to unequivocally show that the war is not over until they say so.\"",
      "The paramilitary group has not directly addressed the Port Sudan drone attacks. Rather, it has repeated its assertion that the SAF is supported by Iran and accused the armed forces of targeting civilian infrastructure and state institutions, calling the military strikes on Khartoum and RSF-held areas in the west and south of the country war crimes.",
      "Both sides stand accused of war crimes which they have denied, but the RSF has been singled out over allegations of mass rape and genocide.",
      "The change in its tactics may have been triggered by battlefield necessity, but is possible because of technological advancement.",
      "The RSF had previously used what are known as suicide or loitering drones, small UAVs with explosive payloads that are designed to crash into targets and can carry out coordinated attacks.",
      "It seems to have deployed this method in Port Sudan, with the commander of the Red Sea Military Zone Mahjoub Bushra describing a swarm of 11 Kamikaze drones in the first strike on a military airbase.",
      "He said the army shot them down, but they turned out to be a tactical distraction to divert attention from a single strategic drone that successfully struck the base.",
      "The make of this drone is not clear. But satellite images reported by Yale researchers and the Reuters news agency have shown advanced UAVs at an airport in South Darfur since the beginning of the year.",
      "The defence intelligence company Janes has determined them to most likely be sophisticated Chinese manufactured CH-95s, capable of long-range strikes.",
      "Jeremy Binnie, an Africa and Middle East analyst at Jane's, told the BBC that photos of what appear to be the remnants of the smaller kamikaze drones suggest they are probably a different version than the RSF had used before, and might be better at penetrating air defences because of their shape.",
      "One regional observer suggested the RSF had been able to breach the SAF's anti-drone technology with signal jammers attached to the drones, but cautioned this was still unproven.",
      "The South Darfur airport in Nyala, the presumptive capital and military base of the Rapid Support Forces, has been repeatedly bombed by the SAF, which destroyed an aircraft there earlier this month.",
      "Some experts see the RSF's bombardment of Port Sudan at least partly as retaliation.",

      "Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening",

      "\"This is a war of technology,\" says Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and research organisation.",
      "\"That's why the foreign supporters are so important, because it's not like the RSF is making the weapons themselves. They're being given this stuff.\"",
      "The army has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supplying the paramilitary fighters with the drones, and cut diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi because of the attacks.",
      "The UAE has strongly rejected the charges. It has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it is providing weaponry to the RSF.",
      "But Mr Lynch says the evidence is overwhelming.",
      "He was the lead author of a US State Department-funded report late last year that concluded with \"near certainty\" the the UAE was facilitating weapons to the RSF by monitoring imagery and flight patterns of airlines previously implicated in violating a UN arms embargo.",
      "He told the BBC it would be surprising if the Emiratis were not helping deliver the drones used in the Port Sudan attacks.",
      "He also determined with similar near-certainty that the Iranians were supplying weapons to the SAF, and he helped authenticate documents provided to the Washington Post that detail the sale of drones and warheads to the army by a Turkish defence firm.",
      "Iran has not responded to the allegations. Turkish officials have denied involvement.",
      "The increasing use of drones by both sides may be redefining the war, but it is the ability of the RSF to strike strategic targets hundreds of kilometres from its positions that has rattled the region.",
      "Over a week of daily attacks on Port Sudan, the paramilitaries hit the country's only working international airport, a power station, several fuel depots, and the air base, apparently trying to disrupt the army's supply lines.",
      "The city is also the main entry port for relief supplies and the UN has warned that this \"major escalation\" could further complicate aid operations in the country and lead to large-scale civilian casualties.",
      "\"This was such a shock and awe campaign that it has not only stunned SAF, I think it's also stunned Egypt, Saudi Arabia, others who were behind SAF, and remakes the entire war,\" says Mr Boswell, adding that it closing the gap in air power between the RSF and the army.",
      "\"The RSF is widely viewed as a non-state actor,\" he says \"and normally, groups like that can muster quite a bit of an insurgent force. But the government with the air force is the one that always has the aerial capacity, and this just turns all those old adages on its head.\"",
      "The development has triggered comparisons to the long-range drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"These weapons have more precision, you don't need a manned aircraft any more, and they are much more affordable than operating sophisticated jets,\" says Mr Binnie.",
      "\"This is part of a broader trend in technological proliferation where you can see what used to be really high-end capabilities being used in a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa.\"",
      "The Sudanese foreign ministry has warned that the attacks threaten regional security and the safety of navigation in the Red Sea, calling on international actors to take \"effective action against the regional sponsor of the militia,\" a reference to the UAE.",
      "Mr Lynch believes that only an agreement between the UAE and the Sudanese army will end the war.",
      "\"This war is always evolving, always changing,\" he says, \"but you'll see it will continue for years and decades unless there is serious diplomatic action to stop it.\"",

      "The current fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller and somewhat secretive 757s.",
      "The White House says that the new plane \u2013 which could require years and millions of dollars to refit and upgrade \u2013 will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.",

      "Trump found little support for the plan in more mainstream outlets as well.",
      "The New York Post, which usually can be counted on to back much of the populist Maga agenda, ran a blunt editorial: \"Qatar's 'Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a 'free gift' - and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.\"",

      "During his first term, Trump himself accused Qatar of funding terror groups.",

      "His new home - for now - is a budget hotel near an American highway.",
      "He and dozens of other white South Africans were moved to the US under President Donald Trump's controversial policy to protect them from the discrimination he alleges they are facing - an accusation that South Africa rejects.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus defends the US president, telling the BBC he left his homeland after receiving death threats in WhatsApp messages.",
      "\"I had to leave a five-bedroom house, which I will lose now,\" Mr Kleinhaus tells the BBC, adding that he also left behind his car, his dogs and even his mother. \"I didn't come here for fun,\" he adds.",
      "The contrast in homes couldn't be more stark. But for Mr Kleinhaus, his situation in Buffalo, New York, is already a better one. \"My children are safe,\" says Mr Kleinhaus, whose wife died in a road accident in 2006.",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk, have even argued that there has been a \"genocide\" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, such as Mr Kleinhaus, who he said were being persecuted.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus is one of a group of 59 who arrived on Tuesday at Dulles airport, near Washington DC, after Trump's administration fast-tracked their applications.",
      "He admits he was surprised at how quickly he got to the US, and that he is grateful to Trump. \"I felt finally somebody in this world is seeing what's going on,\" he says.",

      "Afrikaners are a white ethnic minority who ran South Africa during the apartheid era, implementing racist policies of segregation in the country until the regime was officially abolished in 1994.",
      "But more than 30 years on, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands.",
      "That has led to anger over the slow pace of change. Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that black South Africans have suffered as well as him.",
      "But he says: \"I had nothing to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing.\"",
      "In January, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation - in certain circumstances, when it is deemed \"equitable and in the public interest\".",
      "The South African government says no land has yet been seized. But Mr Kleinhaus says once there is a government claim on your land - as he says is the case with his - it becomes impossible to function.",
      "\"Your land becomes worthless - the land expropriation has gone too far,\" he says. \"People are scared of that. Other Afrikaners who criticise us live in a bubble.\"",
      "Some fellow Afrikaners have described Mr Kleinhaus and the group as opportunists, and that being a victim of crime is not equivalent to the type of persecution that deserves refugee status.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that the murder rate of farmers is low in South Africa, but says he does not want to be a victim. \"There are people in my area who were shot and killed,\" he says.",
      "He says he received threats from members of the local community: \"I'd regularly get messages on WhatsApp saying, 'we'll get rid of you, you're on my land'.\"",

      "What makes the resettlement of the Afrikaners to the US particularly controversial is that other refugees have been banned, including Afghans who earlier this week had their Temporary Protected Status removed.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that move was justified because the security and economic situation in Afghanistan had improved - despite criticism from opposition lawmakers and rights groups.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus says he is sympathetic: \"I mean, I feel sorry for the Afghans that they can't get here. But I know there's a process there. And I know when and if you are approved for the process, they take care of you.\"",
      "Does he worry he's being used as a political pawn by Trump? And that another president could potentially reverse this decision in four years' time?",
      "Mr Kleinhaus pauses, and says: \"Yeah, it is scary, but I am a religious person. Just to be in this first group is an act of God, I believe, because there was a 0.0 something percent chance that you were selected for the first call.\"",
      "Questions over refugees' vetting",
      "Mr Kleinhaus has come under scrutiny for antisemitic posts on social media, which have since been deleted.",
      "Discussing one of these, he says he copied and pasted someone else's thoughts, and  that he was being administered morphine as part of medical treatment at the time - though he admits this was not an excuse.",
      "The 2023 post was made in a moment of anger, he adds, after he saw a video - not verified by the BBC - which purported to show some Jews spitting at Christians in Israel.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus insists the comments were specific to one moment, and not a wider comment about Jewish people. \"Even now, if I see any person going against my religion, I will speak up against it,\" he said.",
      "The US government is facing questions about the vetting process for those being resettled. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was not involved in the screening process for the Afrikaners as it normally would be for refugees heading to the US.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has previously stated it is screening immigrants' social media activity for antisemitism, and using it as a reason for denying applicants.",
      "The Trump administration has been citing allegations of antisemitism as its officials have in recent months arrested and tried to deport pro-Palestinian activists.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, a senior DHS official said: \"The Department of Homeland Security vets all refugee applicants. Any claims of misconduct are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as necessary. DHS does not comment on individual application status.\"",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has launched a crackdown to reduce immigration more broadly. So, is Mr Kleinhaus concerned about any backlash to his group being offered entry to the US?",
      "\"People must not think we are just taking advantage of this,\" he says. \"We come here to make a contribution to the country.",
      "\"I'm not worried it'll fall apart because I believe this is God's plan for me.",
      "\"My life is in his hands. And if if he didn't want me to come, I wouldn't be here.\""

      "Who are the Afrikaners?",
      "South African History Online sums up their identity by pointing out that \"the modern Afrikaner is descended mainly from Western Europeans who settled on the southern tip of Africa during the middle of the 17th Century\".",
      "A mixture of Dutch (34.8%), German (33.7%) and French (13.2%) settlers, they formed a \"unique cultural group\" which identified itself \"completely with African soil\", South African History Online noted.",
      "Their language, Afrikaans, is quite similar to Dutch.",
      "But as they planted their roots in Africa, Afrikaners, as well as other white communities, forced black people to leave their land.",
      "Afrikaners are also known as Boers, which actually means farmer, and the group is still closely associated with farming.",
      "In 1948, South Africa's Afrikaner-led government introduced apartheid, or apartness, taking racial segregation to a more extreme level.",
      "This included laws which banned marriages across racial lines, reserved many skilled and semi-skilled jobs for white people, and forced black people to live in what were called townships and homelands.",
      "They were also denied a decent education, with Afrikaner leader Hendrik Verwoerd infamously remarking in the 1950s that \"blacks should never be shown the greener pastures of education. They should know their station in life is to be hewers of wood and drawers of water\".",
      "Afrikaner dominance of South Africa ended in 1994, when black people were allowed to vote for the first time in a nationwide election, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to power.",

      "Is a genocide being committed?",
      "None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.",
      "But such claims have been circulating among right-wing groups for many years and Trump also referred to a genocide during his first term.",
      "The claims stem from attacks on white farmers, or misleading information circulated online.",
      "In February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.",
      "Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "What have Trump and Musk said?",
      "Defending his decision to give Afrikaners refugee status, Trump said that a \"genocide\" was taking place in South Africa, white farmers were being \"brutally killed\" and their \"land is being confiscated\".",
      "Trump said that he was not sure how he could attend the G20 summit of world leaders, due to be held in South Africa later this year, in such an environment.",
      "\"I don't know how we can go unless that situation's taken care of,\" he added.",
      "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it was \"completely false\" to claim that \"people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution\".",
      "Referring to the first group who have moved to the US, he said: \"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution.\"",
      "The government denies that land is being confiscated from farmers, saying that a bill Ramaphosa signed into law in January was aimed at addressing the land dispossession that black people faced during white-minority rule.",
      "But the law has been condemned by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Ramaphosa's main coalition partner in government. The DA say it will challenge the law in South Africa's highest court, as it threatens property rights.",
      "Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has referred to the country's \"racist ownership laws\", alleging that his satellite internet service provider Starlink was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black\".",
      "To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.",
      "This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid.",
      "The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence.",

      "EFF leader Julius Malema's trademark song is \"Shoot the Boer, Shoot the farmer\", which he sings at political rallies.",
      "Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, saying it was highly inflammatory and amounted to hate speech.",
      "However, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that Malema is within his rights to sing the lyrics - first popularised during the anti-apartheid struggle - at political rallies.",
      "The court ruled that a \"reasonably well-informed person\" would understand that when \"protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence\".",
      "Instead, the song was a \"provocative way\" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end \"land and economic injustice\".",
      "Lobby group AfriForum filed an appeal against the ruling, but South Africa's highest court refused to hear the case, saying it had little chance of succeeding.",
      "In 2023, South Africa's former President Thabo Mbeki urged Malema to stop singing the song, saying it was no longer politically relevant as the anti-apartheid struggle was over.",

    "summary": "Living along the LoC - the volatile India-Pakistan border - means life in a fragile limbo between war and peace.",
    "story": [
      "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.",
      "The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.",
      "\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.",
      "\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.",
      "India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.",
      "The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.",
      "Ceasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)",
      "The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\".",
      "Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.",
      "Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.",
      "\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.",
      "Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.",
      "The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.",
      "Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.",
      "\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.",
      "It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.",
      "Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.",
      "\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.",
      "Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.",
      "\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.",
      "Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.",
      "He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.",
      "The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.",
      "Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.",
      "\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.",
      "\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"",
      "In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\"",
      "\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.",

    "story": [
      "The body which runs Nigeria's university-entrance exams has admitted to a \"technical glitch\" which compromised some results of this year's tests, after nearly 80% of students got low grades.",
      "Students have complained about not being able to log in to the computers, questions not showing up and power cuts making it impossible to take the examinations.",
      "The low pass rate has sparked widespread outrage, especially after one candidate took her own life.",
      "Faith Opesusi Timileyin, 19, who was aspiring to study microbiology at university, died after swallowing poison, her family said.",
      "Her father and elder sister told the BBC that she had sat the exam for the second time and got 146 marks out of 400, lower than the 193 she had last year.",
      "\"The pain made her take her own life,\" her father, Oluwafemi Opesusi, told BBC Pidgin.",
      "Generally 200 or above out of 400 is enough to get a place in university in the exams run by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).",
      "Only 400,000 of the 1.9 million students achieved that mark, one of the worst performances in recent years.",
      "One student, Favour Eke, told BBC Igbo that 10 of the 165 questions didn't appear on the screen - all she could see was the multiple choice options for the answers.",
      "\"We were told to omit the blank questions and continue the exam but it was very hard to concentrate after that,\" she said.",
      "She has also experienced technical problems getting her results, meaning she is very unlikely to get into university this year - the third time she has taken the exams.",
      "She sat the test in the capital, Abuja, which is not one of the centres where students can retake their exams, leaving her completely distraught.",
      "Another student said he had trouble logging in to the computer before someone else's profile mysteriously appeared on the screen, showing different questions and then the machine briefly shut down completely.",
      "\"I did not get to answer all the questions when they told us our time was up because a lot of my time was wasted due to those technical difficulties,\" he said.",

      "He announced that almost 380,000 candidates in 157 affected centres from a total of 887, would be able to retake their exams starting from Saturday.",
      "The zones that are most affected are Lagos and several states in the south-east.",
      "Jamb blamed a failure of the computer system to upload exam responses by candidates in these areas during the first days of the exams.",

      "Many Nigerians on social media have been calling for accountability, with some seeking Oloyede's resignation.",

      "This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.",
      "\"I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,\" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign \"Kozak\".",

      "Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.",
      "He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.",
      "We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.",
      "And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat \u2013 drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.",
      "As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.",
      "\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.",
      "We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.",
      "\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.",
      "\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.",
      "The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.",
      "Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:48:46 GMT",
    "summary": "As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.",
      "Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.",
      "It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.",
      "In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.",
      "Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".",
      "The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.",
      "Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.",
      "\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.",
      "But addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.",
      "India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".",
      "As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.",
      "Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.",
      "For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.",
      "\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.",
      "Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.",
      "In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.",
      "Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.",
      "\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.",
      "If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.",
      "The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.",
      "\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"",
      "As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.",
      "Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.",
      "Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.",
      "Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.",
      "He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.",

    "summary": "Claims of a white genocide are widely discredited, so how do Afrikaners feel about Trump's claims \u2013 and offer of refugee status?",
    "story": [
      "Ulrich Janse van Vuuren has made it his passion to share and showcase some of South Africa's best features with his legion of social media followers.",
      "The 38-year-old white South African often takes snapshots capturing scenes such as a cold Johannesburg morning, the purple Jacaranda trees famously associated with Pretoria or Cape Town's popular beachfronts.",
      "\"Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,\" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.",
      "The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".",
      "This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.",
      "Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.",
      "\"For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,\" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.",
      "\"I'm deeply invested in South Africa's success and I am proud to be part of its journey.\"",
      "And while he wished those who have taken up Trump's offer all the best in the US and urged them to \"not look back\", he insisted that none of them were refugees, but rather \"opportunists\".",
      "\"They've enjoyed more than their share of South Africa's resources and privileges, and none are fleeing racial persecution,\" he said.",
      "Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.",
      "Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him \"more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can\".",
      "Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African \u2013 as seen in the name \u2013 and no longer identify with their European roots.",
      "But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country \u2013 especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.",
      "Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.",
      "Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.",
      "The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.",
      "\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "He later labelled their move a \"cowardly act\" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.",
      "The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.",
      "While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.",
      "He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced \"genuine threats and hardships\", it was important to be cautious \"when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression\".",
      "While many white South Africans echo Mr Janse van Vuuren's sentiments, there are also those who see themselves as a persecuted minority.",
      "Among them is Ilse Steenkamp, who along with her family, has applied for the programme but has not received feedback. She did not want us to use her real name.",
      "Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who \"took over the whole farm\" just as they were about to sell it in order to \"downscale\".",
      "She said they had bought the land two decades ago, after the end of apartheid.",
      "The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.",
      "Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.",
      "Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".",
      "Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".",
      "She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".",
      "\"Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,\" she said.",
      "Sam Bus\u00e0, 60, is another white South African who has applied for the refugee programme.",
      "She is the founder of Amerikaners, a platform aimed at providing information to white South Africans interested in the US resettlement offer.",
      "While Ms Bus\u00e0, who is of English, not Afrikaner, descent, and her three sons have submitted their applications, they have not been interviewed yet.",
      "While it was initially believed that the executive order, vague in its original wording, only applied to white Afrikaners, Ms Bus\u00e0 said it \"clearly is targeting white South Africans\".",
      "On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for those applying for resettlement, which said applicants need to be:",
      "Of South African nationalityAfrikaner or from a racial minorityAble to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future",
      "Of South African nationality",
      "Afrikaner or from a racial minority",
      "Able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future",
      "Responding to the criticism that they were not genuine refugees, Ms Bus\u00e0 said: \"When someone strips away your hope for the future, even though you're not in a warzone... someone ripping away your dreams and hope for the future, that is very dramatic. It's a mental anguish and emotional abuse in a sense.\"",

      "Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?",
      "But Dr Piet Croucamp, an associate professor in political studies at South Africa's North West University, disagreed, echoing the view that those taking up this offer were not refugees as \"South Africa does not persecute people\".",
      "Rather, he speculated that it may be those who have been victims of a crime and \"could define their existence as an unsecure one\".",
      "Dr Croucamp, who is an Afrikaner, said that while he did not expect a significant number of white South Africans to follow suit, there would always be \"opportunistic\" people taking advantage of the situation.",
      "\"This is a small group of people leaving \u2013 the vast majority of Afrikaners are going nowhere and they have expressed themselves. Even the right-wing Afrikaners\u2026 [like] AfriForum and Solidarity have said they are not going anywhere. So even within Afrikaner circles, this is a small group of people,\" he said.",
      "Despite their criticism of the government and its race-based policies, prominent Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and the Solidarity Movement have both reiterated their intention to remain in South Africa.",
      "AfriForum said that while the government was to blame for the departure of the group granted refugee status, they would stay and continue their \"efforts to help create a future for Afrikaners here at the southern tip of Africa\".",
      "This is a view with which Mr Janse van Vuuren agreed.",

      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"",

      "What happened at the resentencing hearing?",
      "During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.",

      "Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".",
      "Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety that the comments were \"predictable at best\".",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:16:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Legendary India batter Virat Kohli announced retirement from international Test cricket on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.",
      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",
      "For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.",
      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",
      "How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.",
      "Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.",
      "\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.",
      "The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.",

    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",

      "Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",

      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:35:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.",
      "Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.",
      "Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.",
      "As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.",
      "President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.",
      "\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.",
      "India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.",
      "The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",
      "\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.",
      "One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.",
      "Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.",
      "India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.",
      "Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)",
      "The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.",
      "In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.",
      "In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.",
      "Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"",
      "During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.",
      "But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.",
      "Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.",
      "\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.",
      "In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)",
      "Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.",
      "\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.",
      "\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)",
      "Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".",
      "\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.",
      "At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.",
      "With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.",
      "And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.",
      "Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.",
      "Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.",
      "\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 17:29:35 GMT",
    "summary": "The US leader has faced criticism over his plan to accept a plane from Qatar worth an estimated $400m.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said his administration wants to accept a plane worth an estimated $400m (\u00a3303m) as a gift from Qatar, calling it \"a great gesture\" that he would be \"stupid\" to turn down.",
      "The potential move has been labelled \"wildly illegal\" by some members of the rival Democratic Party - something the White House denies - and it has attracted criticism from some of Trump's supporters.",
      "Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were \"inaccurate\", and that negotiations were continuing.",
      "The news comes as Trump visits several countries in the Middle East, including Qatar.",
      "BBC Verify has been looking into the legality of presidents accepting gifts.",
      "What do we know about the plane?",
      "On Sunday, US media reported that the Trump administration was preparing to accept a Boeing jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family - saying that the plane would be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, the name for the plane used by presidents.",
      "Trump later posted on Truth Social: \"The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.\"",
      "When questioned by reporters, Trump said: \"It's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.\"",
      "In February, Trump said he was \"not happy with Boeing\" about delays to two new Air Force One jets that he is expecting to receive directly from the firm. He added that the White House could instead \"buy a plane or get a plane, or something\".",
      "The Qatari plane was pictured in Palm Beach, Florida, in February where Trump inspected it. It is currently fitted with three bedrooms, a private lounge and an office, according to its specification summary document from 2015.",
      "Trump and Saudi crown prince sign partnership on first leg of president's diplomatic tour",
      "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US",
      "A Qatari official has told CNN the plane is being given from the Qatari defence ministry to the Pentagon, and that it will be modified to meet Air Force One's safety and security standards.",
      "Experts say this is likely to take years, which means the plane may not be ready for use until near the end of Trump's term.",
      "Trump has said the plane will go directly to his presidential library after he leaves office, and that he \"wouldn't be using it\" after his presidency.",
      "Nonetheless, the move has led to criticism from Democrats as well as some long-time Trump supporters, including Laura Loomer who said: \"This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true.\"",
      "Is the gift legal?",
      "Several senior Democrats have claimed that accepting the gift would be illegal.",
      "Democratic Senator Adam Schiff quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept \"any present... of any kind whatever\" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.",
      "Frank Cogliano, a professor of American history at the University of Edinburgh, says this clause \"was intended to prevent bribery to influence the government\".",
      "\"It is certainly stretching the Constitution and we have not seen a gift on this scale, or of this nature\", says Professor Andrew Moran, a constitutional law expert at London Metropolitan University.",
      "There have been a number of other laws passed by Congress relating to the acceptance of foreign gifts, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, which means that congressional consent is required for the acceptance of foreign gifts above a certain value.",
      "Currently US officials can accept gifts valued at less than $480 (\u00a3363).",
      "Although Trump has referred to the plane ultimately going to his \"library\", experts have suggested he really means his museum foundation.",
      "Ex-presidents typically have a library housing their archive of documents, and a museum - typically funded by private donations - full of memorabilia and open to the public.",
      "Experts who BBC Verify spoke to said the fact that the plane could be given to the administration - and not to the president directly - before being transferred to his museum, may not get around the potential violation of the constitution.",
      "Jordan Libowitz - from the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington - said any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would cross a line: \"Reagan's Air Force One ended up in his presidential library, but there's a difference there. The plane was decommissioned, Reagan never flew on it again, and it sits inside as a museum piece.\"",
      "The US Justice Department has reportedly drafted a memo explaining why it thinks accepting the jet would be permissible, although this has not been made public.",
      "When the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the legality of the deal, she said: \"The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.\"",
      "What is Trump's family doing in the Middle East?",
      "President Trump is on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, hoping to drum up investment for the US.",
      "His visit follows a series of business deals announced by the Trump Organization, which is run by the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.",
      "These include plans to build golf courses and luxury villas in Qatar and the UAE.",
      "President Trump is not currently affiliated with the Trump Organization, having handed over management responsibilities to his children after entering the White House on 20 January.",
      "A deal was announced by the Trump Organization at the beginning of May to develop a Trump-branded luxury 18-hole golf course and a collection of luxury villas north of Qatar's capital, Doha.",
      "At the time, Eric Trump said: \"We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global.\"",
      "Dar Global is a publicly owned Saudi construction company; Qatari Diar is a Qatari state-owned company.",
      "Separately, on 30 April, the Trump Organization announced it would build \"the region's first Trump International Hotel & Tower\" in the \"heart of Dubai\" consisting of 80 floors of \"luxury living and world-class hospitality\".",
      "Eric Trump also visited the UAE recently, speaking at Token 2049, a cryptocurrency conference, on 1 May.",
      "Asked if Trump was likely to meet anyone involved in the family business during his trip, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest the president was doing anything for his own benefit.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygyjy7kz5o",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 01:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",

    "summary": "For decades, third-party mediation on Kashmir has been taboo in the Indian foreign ministry.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.",
      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",
      "Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.",
      "The latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.",
      "India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.",
      "Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.",
      "The two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.",
      "While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.",
      "\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.",
      "Islamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.",
      "\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" a  foreign ministry statement said..",
      "Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.",
      "President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.",
      "The main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the \"ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first\".",
      "\"Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,\" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.",
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site\". This has caught the Indians by surprise.",
      "Delhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.",
      "Historically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".",
      "Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "The conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.",
      "But Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.\"",
      "It is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.",
      "The view from Pakistan is different.",
      "\"Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,\" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,\" Mr Gul says.",
      "Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.",
      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.",
      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",
      "Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.",
      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",

      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",

    "story": [
      "As the sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs entered its fourth day, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, continued her testimony. Her cross-examination began Thursday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Ventura's testimony will likely last the rest of the week. Here are some key takeaways from it so far.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",

      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel\u00a0is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband and brother have both been seen in court for support.",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",

      "Her grandfather, Harold Lee, became a prosperous businessman at the turn of the last century.",

      "\"The film company the Lee family created is really reflective of a kind of 'do-it-yourself' mentality, and an entrepreneurialship within Chinese-American communities,\" Tam said.",
      "The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade. Few still remain, most were lost. The company went dark with the onset of the Great Depression, but the Lee family's impact in the world of cinema continued with the creation of the New York Chinese Film Exchange.",
      "\"My grandfather also bought a theater right on Park Row... and he renamed it the Silver Star,\" Lee said. \"It was a really big deal. On the weekends, you would go to the Chinese movies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand for four-and-a-half hours Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",

    "summary": "Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing trial on sex-trafficking charges. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and 12 jurors were seated\u00a0along with six alternates on Monday, May 12. The selected group included 12 men and six women.",
      "Opening statements immediately followed, and the prosecutors' case against Combs started to take shape.",
      "\"To the public, he was Puff Daddy or Diddy, a cultural icon, a businessman, larger than life. But there was another side to him,\" one prosecutor said.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA is prioritizing the review of some previously approved food additives, including ADA, dubbed the \"yoga mat\" chemical.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is planning to revisit its approval of the food additive ADA, the agency's top foods official announced Thursday, after longstanding questions over the safety of the so-called \"yoga mat\" chemical that can be a bread ingredient in the U.S. but is banned in Europe.",
      "Also called azodicarbonamide, the FDA previously approved ADA's use to whiten cereal flour and improve baking bread dough.",
      "Advocacy groups have criticized the use of this chemical in food\u00a0for years, over concerns about its potential health risks. The \"yoga mat\" nickname comes from ADA's\u00a0other uses\u00a0in the manufacturing of plastics and rubbers.",
      "In Europe, it is illegal to add the ingredient to bread, given the possibility it could result in a possible carcinogen called semicarbazide when it breaks down into other chemicals during bread making.",
      "After international health authorities in recent years also raised concerns over its use in food, guidance from 1965 that had previously allowed for its use was withdrawn by a committee convened by the United Nations over worries that there was not enough data to support its safety.",
      "The FDA previously said that it thought azodicarbonamide remained safe to add to food, after studying how much semicarbazide Americans might be eating. The agency said studies in some mice found that semicarbazide could cause tumors, but only at levels that \"far exceed\" the estimated amounts people are eating through bread and other foods.",
      "Other ingredients that the agency is planning to add to its list of food additives that it's prioritizing for a renewed safety review include BHT and BHA, two preservatives that are authorized for some food uses in Europe but have also faced concerns over the risk they could cause cancer.",
      "News of the ingredients being prioritized for review was announced by Kyle Diamantas, the current acting deputy commissioner in charge of the FDA's Human Foods Program, alongside a new plan he said would further step up scrutiny of previously approved food chemicals.",
      "\"That plan will include the creation and rolling out of a modernized, evidence-based prioritization scheme for reviewing chemicals presently in the food supply, and that will be made available for public comment later this month,\" Diamantas said.",
      "The Food Fix newsletter previously reported that the plan would soon be released.",
      "Diamantas also said that details of the agency's systematic process to review the safety of chemicals in the food supply will soon be finalized, after the Biden administration first proposed laying out a more formal approach last year.",
      "\"As many of you know, there were meetings last year and we ultimately had over 70,000 comments on our post-market review process framework,\" Diamantas said at a session of the Food Safety Summit conference Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "On a quiet plot of land in rural New Mexico, Jeff Deming feels like he's really living, once again.",
      "\"Mentally, it's day and night,\" he said.",
      "He's able to do the things that make him happy, like woodworking, despite living with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"Physically, I feel better than I did 2-3 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Deming credits the treatment he received during a first-of-its-kind clinical study he participated in at the University of California, San Francisco: Psilocybin therapy for people with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",
      "Bradley and a team of researchers at UCSF are trying to figure out how Psilocybin may help treat mood dysfunction and more in those living with the neurodegenerative disease.",
      "\"This is a first step, and now we've opened the door to being able to really investigate the effects of Psilocybin for people with Parkinson's,\" she said.",
      "12 patients participated in this first-round study, which involved a first and second course of Psilocybin treatment.",
      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",
      "Bradley says her team is scaling up their work and are in the process of recruiting for a larger study, due to the success with the initial research.",
      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's. It's a very quickly growing disease that's becoming more and more prevalent in our population, so, we really feel like we have to be investigating every possible route that could mean new treatments for patients.\"",
      "Two years removed from his controlled Psilocybin dosing, Deming says he feels better now than he did when he received his initial diagnosis four years ago.",
      "\"Something about this experience just freed everything back up so I could think again, I could dream again,\" he said.",
      "He'd like to see more research into psychedelic therapies for a range of conditions, with the hopes that more people will be able to reclaim the reins of life, as he has.",
      "\"There's been such a stigma against the research with it,\" he said. \"It is definitely worth looking more closely at.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",

      "Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \"underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress.\"",
      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",
      "\"Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,\" said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "All but two states saw declines last year \u2014 with some of the biggest in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation's decades-long overdose epidemic. Experts say more research needs to be done to understand what drove the reduction, but they mention several possible factors. Among the most cited:",
      "Increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.Expanded addiction treatment.Shifts in how people use drugs.The growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.",

      "The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.",
      "The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it's clear that there was a huge drop last year.",
      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",
      "Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.",
      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",
      "But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \"States can either say, 'We won, we can walk away'\" in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.",
      "\"We believe that taking a public health approach that seeks to support \u2014 not punish \u2014 people who use drugs is crucial to ending the overdose crisis,\" said Dr. Tamara Olt, an Illinois woman whose 16-year-old son died of a heroin overdose in 2012. She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.",
      "Olt attributes recent declines to the growing availability of naloxone, work to make treatment available, and wider awareness of the problem.",

It helps them to discover new areas of knowledge. It helps them to explore more deeply. What we're really focused on is making sure that there is equitable access to AI.\"",
      "Belsky equated the impact of AI in the 21st century workplace to that of email and internet access in the 1990s.",

      "One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Grouette spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn't land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \"It was this implied, 'You're stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "Indeed, despite the unemployment rate still hovering at a historic low\u00a0at 4.2%, for an increasing number of out-of-work Americans, it's taking longer to find a new job. Meanwhile, the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.",
      "Grouette, however, eventually found a way out of her toxic workplace. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she was working a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\"You can't put a price tag on it,\" she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\"",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\"We're developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\" said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Disagreement vs. abuse",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \"if I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a 'Suck it up' attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \"I don't think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\"",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\"What makes something toxic: It's more pervasive, more consistent over time,\" Tosti-Kharas said. \"You may have tried some things and it's not getting better. ... It's very deeply entrenched.\"",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\"It is a relationship where you can't communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can't say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\" Atchison said.",
      "Follow your gut",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\"I'm reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I'm applying to, because I can't lose my hair again over a job,\" said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\"It's almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\" Atchison said. \"If someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\"",
      "More complaints since COVID-19",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\"Socializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "Document your concerns",
      "\"Don't hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you're talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don't internalize it. And don't take someone's perception as fact.\"",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \"I'm going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\" she said. \"Is there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else's opinion?\"",
      "Human resources may or may not help",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \"In the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it's you who has to go somewhere,\" Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \"you wouldn't say, 'Let me try to work with the radon,' or 'How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?'\" she said. \"You would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\"",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\"If somebody gives you an impression that you're not able to leave this job, that's just not true,\" Grouette said. \"Those sorts of people don't have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they're volatile to you, they're volatile to others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation now winding its way through the House includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, as well as sharply lowering lowering rates on corporations. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "The world's largest retailer said President Trump's wide-ranging levies on U.S. trade partners are impeding its ability to keep prices low for its customers.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",

      "Rising cost pressures for retailers",
      "The Trump administration on Monday said that, starting May 14, it is lowering the tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days. As part of that agreement, China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%. The sides are expected to continue negotiations, although ongoing uncertainty over trade policy is weighing on companies.",
      "\"The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world from dozens of countries,\" McMillon said. \"Other than the U.S., the other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada. China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\"",
      "Still, the Walmart executive emphasized that the retailer will do what it can to avoid\u00a0passing the import taxes onto customers.",
      "\"We'll do our best on what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,\" McMillon said. \"In  some cases we are holding retail prices where they are despite the tariffs cost pressures.\"",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March, according to government data. However, many household costs remain elevated, the CBS News price tracker shows.",
      "Walmart also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, as Mr. Trump vows to strike favorable trade deals with countries that are subject to steep levies on imports.",
      "Walmart earned $4.4 billion in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.1 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.6 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Tariff hit on consumer spending",
      "Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in the earnings call that the company expects the U.S. to strike more agreements with its trade partners, and that tariff rates could drop.",
      "\"However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year-over-year,\" he added.",

    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",
      "This tax break would last only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Expanding the estate tax exemption",
      "The estate tax exemption was temporarily doubled under the TCJA, but that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025. In the current tax year, gifts and inheritances of up to almost $14 million for individuals and $28 million for married couples are exempted from federal gift or estate taxes.",
      "Without a change, that threshold will revert to its pre-TCJA level, or about $7 million for an individual.",
      "The new bill would permanently extend the higher estate tax exemption, while boosting it to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026. After that, the exemption would be indexed to inflation.",

      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "In recent years, the top customer complaints have been related to cancellations and delays, refunds, lost or damaged baggage, reservations, fares, customer service, disabilities, involuntary bumping and more.",
      "Notably, in 2024, total complaints against U.S. airlines rose 9%, while passenger volume only rose 4%.",
      "\"Passengers are ticked off, and they know now that voicing their concerns gets results, because we saw ton of consumer protections passed last year,\" Murray said.",
      "Pandemic impact",
      "Prior to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S., annual complaints against all airlines hovered below 20,000. That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found. It ranked second-worst for the share of wheelchairs that it mishandled.",

      "The median sale price in the first-quarter of 2025 was almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The affordability gap has its roots in the housing crisis that started in 2006, which caused new construction to dry up for years afterward, she added.",
      "The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property, Evangelou said. The result: More middle-income families are getting shut out of the housing market in many regions.",
      "\"It's discouraging for many people now,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.\"",
      "These households represent people in careers such as nursing and teaching and in trades like plumbing, she added. \"The middle-income buyers are the backbone of the housing market, so we need homes they can actually afford,\" Evangelou said.",
      "Where the affordability gap is worst",
      "Twenty-six of the biggest 100 cities have affordability gaps that are worsening, the NAR research found. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties, Evangelou added.",
      "They range from high-cost cities like Los Angeles to more affordable areas like the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Scranton in Pennsylvania, the report found.",
      "Partly because of restrictive zoning rules, Pennsylvania ranked 44th out of all U.S. states in the pace of new housing built from 2017 to 2023, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit foundation that conducts research on areas that shape public policy.",
      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

    "story": [
      "Dick's Sporting Goods is buying ailing shoe company Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, the second deal for a large U.S. footwear maker in recent weeks as the industry grapples with the impact of steep new American tariffs on their production.",
      "Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos.",
      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",
      "The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.",
      "Fool Locker's stock slide",
      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "\"While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,\" Saunders said.",
      "Dick's said that it expects to close the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.",
      "Dick's stock dropped more than 13% before the market open, while shares of Foot Locker surged more than 82%.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks'\u00a0new dress code for baristas has sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, a union representing the coffee giant's workers said Wednesday.",
      "The new dress code, which went into effect on Monday, requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "The new dress code comes as the company works on its\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\"\u00a0mission, aimed at revitalizing its cafes and boosting sales. CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought on from Chipotle to lead the coffee chain\u00a0last year, has said \"there's a shared sense that we have drifted from our core.\"",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",
      "\"Starbucks has lost its way. Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\" said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \"Customers don't care what color our clothes are when they're waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\"",
      "Most stores remain open",
      "Summers and others also criticized the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees no longer are allowed to wear to work on an internal website. Starbucks said it would give two free black T-shirts to each employee when it announced the new dress code.",
      "Starbucks said Wednesday that the strike was having a limited impact on its 10,000 company-operated U.S. stores.",
      "\"[B]y their own measure, less than 1% of stores have participated in their attempts to cause disruption,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The company added that more than 99% of its stores are open and serving customers. In some cases the strikes closed stores for less than an hour, the company noted.",
      "\"It would be more productive if the union would put the same effort into coming back to the table to finalize a reasonable contract,\" Starbucks added.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has been unionizing U.S. stores since 2021. Starbucks and the union have yet to reach a contract agreement, despite agreeing to return to the bargaining table in February 2024.",

    "summary": "Expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, according to an investigation led by Consumer Reports and others.",
    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",

China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",

As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

      "The settlement stems from a 2021 lawsuit filed by Fumiko Lopez, a California resident who owned several Apple devices, and other consumers who alleged Siri listened to private or confidential conversations. Those discussions were then allegedly shared with third-party businesses, such as restaurants and clothing brands, that then targeted Lopez and other consumers with ads in Apple search and its Safari web browser, the lawsuit claims.",

      "Nissan is slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, as the Japanese automaker reported a loss Tuesday for the fiscal year that just ended amid slipping vehicle sales in China and other nations, and towering restructuring costs.",
      "Nissan said it will reduce the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under what it called its recovery plan to carry out \"decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.\" It did not say which plants were being closed but confirmed the closures will include factories in Japan.",
      "\"We have a mountain to climb,\" CEO Ivan Espinosa told reporters, stressing the task will not be easy, requiring discipline and team work. \"Starting today, we build the future for Nissan.\"",
      "The job cuts to be done by March 2028 include the 9,000 head count reduction announced last year. Nissan also previously announced the scrapping of plans to build a battery plant in Japan.",
      "Espinosa, who took the helm earlier this year, said the latest plans followed a careful review of operations, to align production with demand, including coming up with market and product strategies. Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 18:48:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

      "Despite the focus on offering a more luxurious travel experience, United also wants to enhance flights for passengers with more modest budgets.",
      "\"[W]e also know we need to pay attention to the rear of the aircraft, because the bulk of the passengers are flying in the main cabin, not in the Polaris cabin,\" Nocella said. \"And we've made efforts to make sure that that experience is going to get better, not worse.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 11:53:34 -0400",
    "summary": "A House Republican bill would require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or be enrolled in school for at least 80 hours a month.",
    "story": [
      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "There are exceptions for the work requirement, however. The bill states that people who are under 19 years old as well as women who are pregnant or who are under postpartum medical care are among those who can receive a waiver.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

      "In February, President Trump moved to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption by imposing a 120% tax, or a flat fee of $100 on packages. When the exemption was eliminated on May 2, tariffs of up to 145% became applicable to packages from China worth $800 or less.",
      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order stated.",

Temu has\u00a0halted shipments\u00a0of goods from China to the U.S., and is now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based customers' orders and avoid tariffs.",

      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 20:35:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The nation's disaster relief agency \u2014 rocked by staff cuts and a push for its elimination by President Trump \u2014 is \"not ready\" for hurricane season, which starts in just two weeks, an internal review said.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is \"not ready\" for hurricane season in June, according to an internal review obtained by CBS News\u2014 as FEMA contends with staff cuts and a push by President Trump to eliminate the nation's disaster relief agency.",
      "The powerpoint presentation was created after FEMA's new acting leader, David Richardson, ordered the agency to review hurricane preparedness, with storm season roughly two weeks away. In a series of slides, dated May 12, FEMA identified apparent problems at the disaster relief agency, including a need to \"refocus on its core mission while preparing for the 2025 Hurricane Season.\"",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" said one of the slides.",
      "Elsewhere in the presentation, it says most of FEMA's readiness process for hurricane season \"has been derailed this year due to other activities like staffing and contracts\" \u2014 an apparent reference to layoffs of probationary workers and sweeping changes to FEMA's contract workforce.",
      "\"It has not been normal hurricane season preparedness yet,\" the slides read.",
      "CNN was first to report on the internal document.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DHS, which oversees FEMA, for comment. In a statement to CNN, the agency called the story \"grossly out of context\" and said it is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.\"",
      "\"The slide was used during a daily meeting Acting Administrator David Richardson has held every day titled Hurricane Readiness Complex Problem Solving. In other words, exactly what the head of an emergency management agency should be doing before Hurricane Season,\" a DHS spokesperson's statement to CNN read.",
      "In a 30-minute town hall meeting with staff Thursday, Richardson would not say whether the agency is ready for hurricane season when asked, according to multiple FEMA employees. Richardson, who has been on the job for less than a week, responded that he's still working on it and should have a better idea within a couple of weeks.",
      "The official start of Atlantic hurricane season is June 1.",
      "The internal presentation also cites \"culture issues,\" staffing shortages and challenges coordinating with other federal agencies.",
      "Parts of the document seem to reference Mr. Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states. The slides say there's a perception that state officials are \"passing [the] buck\" to FEMA, and cite the need for \"managing expectations and understanding what FEMA's role is\" \u2014 suggesting the federal agency should offer \"supplemental assistance\" in some cases.",
      "During Thursday's town hall, Richardson cited California and Texas as examples of states that are capable of responding to their own natural disasters, multiple FEMA employees said. The comment raised eyebrows among several FEMA staff members who deployed to Texas' deadly winter cold snap in February 2021, causing hundreds of thousands to lose power.",
      "FEMA has faced a turbulent few months as it prepares for the Atlantic hurricane season. Mr. Trump has criticized the agency's handling of prior natural disasters, and has floated either scrapping FEMA or transforming it into a \"support agency\" that largely defers to the states.",
      "The agency laid off hundreds of probationary employees earlier this year. And in March, the agency indicated a large share of its workforce would be required to apply for contract extensions through the Department of Homeland Security. The move could impact more than half of FEMA's workers, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency's former acting head, Cameron Hamilton, was fired by the Trump administration last week and replaced by Richardson after Hamilton told lawmakers he doesn't believe eliminating FEMA is in the country's \"best interests\" \u2014 clashing with Mr. Trump's views.",
      "In his first all-hands meeting last week, Richardson told staff, \"Don't get in my way\u2026 I will run right over you,\" according to a recording obtained by CBS News.",
      "Richardson, a former Marine who attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, backed Mr. Trump's plan to shrink FEMA, and said he plans on looking for ways to \"push things down to the states\" and \"do more cost sharing with the states.\"",
      "\"I am as bent on achieving the President's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty, where I took my Marines to Iraq, eleven of them,\" he said at last week's meeting.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 19:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week criticized White South Africans who claimed refugee status in the U.S. as \"cowardly.\"",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according to BBC News.",
      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",
      "Must be of South African nationality; and\u00a0Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and\u00a0Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.",

      "A military parade to mark the Army's anniversary next month \u2014 coinciding with President Trump's birthday \u2014 is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, an Army spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers who will be housed in federal buildings. It could also involve 50 helicopters, prompting \"extensive coordination\" with the Federal Aviation Administration, the spokesperson said.",
      "The event will take place as part of the Army's 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's 79th birthday.",
      "Reports about a possible military parade began circulating last month. Initial plans obtained by the Associated Press two weeks ago called for more than 6,600 soldiers, seven bands and 150 vehicles, including tanks as well as Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles \u2014 though at the time, the Army said the plans had not been finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the plans earlier this month: \"We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,\" the president told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"",
      "The president also said the event isn't tied to his birthday. When asked about the price tag, Mr. Trump said it would be \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it.\"",
      "\"We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News.",
      "The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats. Earlier this month, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee called the plan wasteful, writing in a statement, \"The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in the pageantry of a military parade dates back years. During a 2017 visit to France during his first term, the president praised the country's annual Bastille Day parade and suggested \"we're going to have to try and top it\" on the Fourth of July.",

    "summary": "President Trump's transportation secretary said Thursday the FAA's air traffic control system \"truly is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has resorted to buying replacement parts on eBay and making new parts with 3D printers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers Thursday \u2014 as the air safety system draws scrutiny for decades-old technology and persistent staffing problems.",
      "\"We do try to buy replacement parts on eBay for this really old equipment,\" Duffy told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Thursday. \"Sometimes, we can't even buy it on eBay, so we're trying to use 3D printing to craft replacement parts for the system that we use.\"",
      "Duffy made similar comments on \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, saying the FAA has turned to eBay because \"we can't buy parts for new\" for some of the agency's aging systems.",
      "Duffy appeared at the Senate hearing as the Trump administration pushes for a sweeping overhaul of the country's air traffic control system over the next three years, calling for the replacement of hundreds of radars, over a dozen new control towers and a new telecommunications system. The plan could cost \"lots of billions,\" Duffy said last week, likely requiring Congress to appropriate additional funds for the FAA.",
      "Air safety has entered the fore after a series of jarring incidents. Dozens of people were killed in a January collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport. And in recent weeks, the FAA facility that handles the airspace near Newark Liberty International Airport has been plagued by staffing shortages and equipment outages, leading to severe delays at the busy airport.",
      "\"We are facing a crisis,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the appropriations panel.",
      "Duffy told lawmakers Thursday air travel in the U.S. is still safe, citing \"multiple redundancies\" \u2014 but he acknowledged the air traffic control system needs an overhaul.",
      "\"The system we currently use, it truly is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We should've paid way more attention to it as a country,\" Duffy said Thursday. \"We've let it age, and now we're seeing the cracks of that age play out in real time for us.\"",
      "Duffy also pushed back on criticism that job cuts at the FAA could end up impacting safety. The agency laid off several hundred probationary staff earlier this year, amid a wider effort by the Trump administration to shrink the federal workforce. A union representing some FAA workers told the Associated Press in February the cuts affected mechanics and other specialists who help support the work of air traffic controllers and safety inspectors.",
      "\"You can have all your air traffic controllers there, but if they don't have the support staff, we can't know that they're doing the job,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.",
      "Murray also cited reports that air traffic controllers were mistakenly sent an email earlier this year offering them buyouts to leave their jobs, which she said was \"really callous.\"",
      "Duffy said the agency has not cut any air traffic controllers, and the layoffs and voluntary buyouts that hit the federal workforce earlier this year excluded safety positions. \"We've been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,\" Duffy told lawmakers.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday pressed an attorney for the federal government on how President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship would be implemented amid scores of legal challenges that have gone against the administration.",
      "The bid by the Trump administration to\u00a0narrow three lower court orders\u00a0blocking Mr. Trump from ending birthright citizenship is a test of district judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide. Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought to focus on what he described as a \"bipartisan\" problem of lower-level judge's issuing nationwide injunctions, leading to \"judge shopping,\" by plaintiffs seeking a quick win.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether \"judge shopping\" applied to the birthright citizenship issue, for which the administration has suffered a string of defeats.",
      "\"Every court is ruling against you,\" Kagan said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump during his first term, peppered Sauer with questions about how a policy denying citizenship at birth could be implemented as quick as the administration wants. Mr. Trump's executive order gave the government 30 days to implement his policies.",
      "\"What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn?\" Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Sauer replied that hospitals might not have to change practices, but that the government could develop a process to reject \"the wrong designation of citizenship.\"",
      "Kavanaugh noted that the executive order only gave the government about 30 days to develop a policy.",
      "\"You think they can get it together in time?\" he asked.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, were the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "Sauer argued that instead of trying to get nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs could bring class action cases in order to oppose policies. Justices including Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch questioned that approach. Gorsuch, who has previously expressed skepticism about nationwide injunctions, noted that it can take a long time to build and certify a class for litigation.",
      "Another justice who has voiced concerns about nationwide injunctions by lower courts, Clarence Thomas, appeared sympathetic to the government's position. He noted that they were once uncommon.",
      "\"We survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions,\" Thomas said.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said federal appeals court panels and the Supreme Court are often better suited to issue sweeping injunctions than lower court judges. He said individual judges are \"vulnerable to an occupational disease\" of overstepping their authority.",
      "While arguments focused on injunctions, justices occasionally turned to the executive order itself. Sotomayor said it goes against previous decisions by the nation's highest court.",
      "\"As far as I see it this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,\" Sotomayor said. \"And you are claiming that not just the Supreme Court, that both the Supreme Court and no lower court, can stop an executive, universally, from violating....those holdings.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson painted the government's argument as establishing a \"catch me if you can regime,\" requiring every individual whose rights are violated by a new policy to obtain a lawyer and sue.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",
      "\"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\"",
      "He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward.",
      "\"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:07:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Donald Trump Jr. has maneuvered potentially lucrative business deals while also becoming a power player to his father.",
    "story": [
      "When the crypto mining firm American Bitcoin announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange this week, the company called it a \"major milestone\" for a key stakeholder, Dominari Holdings \u2014 a little-known investment house that recently added a very recognizable name to its advisory board: Donald Trump Jr.",
      "It was the latest maneuver in a series of high-stakes, and potentially lucrative business deals Trump Jr. and his younger brother Eric, also a Dominari adviser, stand to benefit from.",
      "Since his father won the 2024 election, Trump Jr. has joined at least eight corporate boards or advisory committees, adding political clout and his famous family brand to companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online.",
      "During President Trump's second term, his son Donald Jr. has morphed from a lower profile presence in Washington to what Trump first term press secretary Sean Spicer, who knows Trump Jr. well, describes as the \"most prominent non-elected representative of the MAGA base hands down, the No. 1 surrogate and power player in the ecosystem outside of his father.\" The most overt symbol of that ascendence \u2013 and of the Trump family's unique blend of governing and deal-making, went public last month, with the announcement of a highly exclusive private club, which is named\u00a0 \"Executive Branch.\"",
      "At the coming-out event, the cocktails flowed and servers passed caviar to A-list guests that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Paul Atkins, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and FCC chair Brendan Carr. The Capital's buzzy newsletters revealed the club's eye-popping club membership fee: $500,000.",
      "Private clubs have long been a fixture of official Washington, where lobbyists and well-heeled donors can mingle with members of Congress and high-ranking officials.\u00a0 But this venture launched by the president's oldest son is something new \u2014 and, according to critics, serves as the latest example of how the Trump family has turbo-charged Washington's pay-to-play culture.",
      "\"I don't think there has ever been anything comparable to this use of the presidency to advance private business interests,\" said Joseph Briffaut, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Columbia Law School.",
      "Critics fear a pay-to-play culture",
      "To government watchdogs, the members-only social club embodies what they say is an increasingly brazen mingling of private business interests and government policy.",
      "\"It's unseemly and it undermines the public's faith that the government is operating in the public interest,\" said Brett Kappel, a veteran Washington, D.C., election lawyer.",
      "Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who has for years advocated for stronger ethics rules in the nation's capital, told CBS News she views the club as a blatant play to cash in with interest groups seeking access to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This is literally members bringing money into the pockets of Donald Trump Jr, and his business partners,\" Sloan said.",
      "Trump Jr.'s allies disagree. They argue the extravagant membership fee actually cuts against the claim that it is a vehicle for influence peddling \u2014 because members are already so well connected.",
      "\"If your goal was to let as many people in as possible, you'd have every lobbyist in D.C. join,\" said one source familiar with the concept behind the club, pointing out that members who could afford the sky-high admission fee would likely already be well known in Washington's power corridors.",
      "For his part, Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name or testing any ethical boundaries.",
      "\"I'm a private citizen who has been a businessman my entire life,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"It's laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room and cease what I've been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,\" Trump Jr. added.",
      "The White House calls Trump Jr.'s private sector dealings ethically sound, pointing out that President Trump's assets are held in a trust controlled by his family",
      "The \"Executive Branch\" club is only one of the ways Trump Jr. has raised his profile during his father's second term. The president's son has rapidly expanded the family's crypto profile and continued to pursue real estate investments.\u00a0 He has also been a front-facing leader of the MAGA empire, supplanting his sister Ivanka and brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the most high-profile \u2014 and politically astute \u2014 Trump scion in Washington.",
      "The \"Trump bump\"",
      "The family business is a global enterprise. Recently, Trump Jr. made a whirlwind tour of several foreign nations, including Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where he looked in on real estate interests, delivered lucrative speeches and met with government leaders, according to The New York Times.",
      "At home, Trump Jr.'s move to join a spree of corporate boards in the role of adviser or board member traces in part to his relationship with Omeed Malik, the financier and mega Trump donor who is also Trump Jr.'s co-founder in the D.C. social club.",
      "Just days after the election, Malik brought on Trump Jr. as a partner in his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, which says on its website that it invests in conservative companies and eschews \"woke capitalism\" and other left-wing causes, a deal a knowledgeable source said was in the works before the election. \u00a0 Trump Jr. soon joined the boards of arms retailer GrabAGun as well as the online health care company BlinkRX, both 1789 Capital properties.",
      "It is not hard to see the impact when a company adds Trump Jr. to its board. When Dominari Holdings inc., a wealth management and banking services company, announced that it was bringing on both of the president's sons, its stock price shot up 83% to a record high, eventually settling down to 30% above where it was before Trump Jr. joined. Shortly thereafter, Dominari's CEO announced that the company was planning investments in AI and data centers, growth industries where the Trump administration has been massively rolling back regulations. In a company press release, CEO Kyle Wood he cited Trump Jr.'s and Eric Trump's \"strategic insight\" in both of those sectors.",
      "And this week, the Bitcoin mining company owned partly by Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric engineered a listing on the NASDAQ after merging with a smaller, publicly traded mining firm called Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. Dominari Holdings is effectively acting as the banker for the deal and has been reaching out to potential investors.",
      "In another example of the so-called \"Trump bump,\" the stock price of Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone manufacturer, nearly doubled when the news hit that Trump Jr. was joining the board.",
      "Unusual Machines, which manufactures its unmanned aerial vehicles and components in the U.S., is aiming to reduce American dependence on Chinese drones. But for the time being the company is reliant on Chinese parts, which means that the Trump administration's yo-yoing tariffs on China could hurt the company's bottom line. CEO Allan Evans has said he would not ask Trump Jr. to intervene with the federal government on the company's behalf for relief.",
      "\"I would never ask him to do anything or facilitate anything like that,\" Evans told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump Jr. and his defenders clap back at critics who suggest his moves to join board seats and champion business interests carry the echoes of past ventures by presidential relatives like Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Hunter Biden. They call him a skilled entrepreneur with a long record of business success who has capitalized on his position by making shrewd business decisions, cultivating lucrative connections among tech and finance leaders, all while building up a powerful political operation in Washington.",
      "The Hunter Biden comparisons, in particular, have drawn a sharp response: \"He became a 'businessman' after his dad got elected,\" Trump Jr. said in a social media post. \"I joined a Venture Capital Firm that invests in private American companies \u2014 Nothing to do with the government.\"",
      "MAGA power broker",
      "\"Don Jr. was an accomplished businessman long before his father got into politics and just continues to grow,\" said Sean Spicer, who served the president as press secretary in his first term and now hosts the Sean Spicer podcast.",
      "Today, Spicer says Trump Jr. is the man to see. Spicer, who worked closely with the president's son during the first term, says has seen the evolution up close.",
      "\"If the phone rings and it's Don Jr., you better pick it up on the first ring,\" Spicer said. During the 2020 campaign Trump Jr. emerged as a potent asset for his father, stumping on the trail and fully embodying the MAGA brand.\u00a0 He flung \"red meat\" to the rapturous crowds at Trump rallies and showed an instinct for the jugular that reminded observers of Trump senior.",
      "A big part of his success, his friends say, is an ability to blend with the grassroots MAGA world.",
      "\"Don Jr. isn't just a billionaire's son, he's one of us,\" said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the preeminent MAGA aligned youth organization and an associate of Trump Jr.",
      "Trump Jr.'s inside and outside game makes him a unique player in Trump's Washington, his allies say \u2014 someone with unparalleled clout within the administration who is also able to operate freely in the private sector.",
      "He has forged close ties with powerful tech titans like Elon Musk and David O. Sacks, the angel investor who was a key figure in bringing a powerful and wealthy contingent of Silicon Valley over to Trump. Sacks is currently serving as the White House Czar for both Crypto and AI. Last month, he became member #1 of the Executive Branch club.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tax-cuts-overtime-social-security-senior-deduction/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:07:32 -0400",
    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",
      "This tax break would last only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Expanding the estate tax exemption",
      "The estate tax exemption was temporarily doubled under the TCJA, but that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025. In the current tax year, gifts and inheritances of up to almost $14 million for individuals and $28 million for married couples are exempted from federal gift or estate taxes.",
      "Without a change, that threshold will revert to its pre-TCJA level, or about $7 million for an individual.",
      "The new bill would permanently extend the higher estate tax exemption, while boosting it to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026. After that, the exemption would be indexed to inflation.",

      "A federal judge set Dugan's trial to begin the week of July 21.",
      "Dugan was charged with one count of concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction, and on Tuesday a federal grand jury indicted her on those charges.",

      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",
      "While Flores-Ruiz was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a criminal court appearance, law enforcement waited outside of her courtroom to arrest him on an administrative warrant.",

      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:42:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Dissatisfied environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.",
      "Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.",
      "\"You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured,\" she said.",
      "When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.",
      "Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.",
      "\"This current administration promised voters it would 'Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-alien-enemies-act-pennsylvania-ruling/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump nominee, ruled the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's push to remove people from the U.S. using the wartime Alien Enemies Act got a rare stamp of approval from a federal judge this week, as one of the more controversial parts of Mr. Trump's immigration strategy faces a slew of court challenges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania, a Trump nominee, ruled Tuesday the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua. However, Haines also said the administration hasn't given people facing Alien Enemies Act removal enough notice to bring court challenges.",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow: The case only applies to one person, a Venezuelan man who was arrested in central Pennsylvania and moved to Texas. But it further complicates a nationwide battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which Mr. Trump has used to rapidly expel hundreds of migrants and send them to a supermax prison in El Salvador.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 says the government can remove people during an invasion or a \"predatory incursion\" launched by a foreign nation. Prior to this year, the law had been invoked three times in history, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In all other cases, the law has been used for citizens of countries at war with the United States. But the Trump administration argued in a March proclamation that accused Tren de Aragua members count as \"alien enemies,\" claiming the gang \u2014 which Mr. Trump has deemed a foreign terrorist group \u2014 has extensive links to the Venezuelan government.",
      "The use of the Alien Enemies Act has drawn controversy, with critics arguing the administration hasn't given people an opportunity to challenge their cases in court. Many of the migrants who were sent to a Salvadoran prison don't have clear criminal records, CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" found last month. The Trump administration has stood by its use of the law, casting it as a necessary step to crack down on crime by the notorious Tren de Aragua.",
      "Why does the judge say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "Haines wrote on Tuesday the Alien Enemies Act can apply to Tren de Aragua members. The judge defined a \"predatory incursion\" as a \"hostile entry into the United States by a cohesive group,\" like a U.S.-designated terrorist group, with a \"common goal of causing significant disruption\" \u2014 which she said lines up with Mr. Trump's proclamation in March.",
      "Haines also deferred to Mr. Trump on the question of whether Tren de Aragua is directed by Venezuela's government, though some U.S. intelligence agencies disagree with the administration, according to a memo obtained by several news outlets.",
      "But the judge broke with the administration in one key respect: She said the government must give people facing Alien Enemies Act removal at least 21 days' notice, in both English and Spanish, so they can bring court challenges. That's far more than the 12 hours' notice Haines said the government had promised to give in the past.",
      "The case reached Haines' desk after a Venezuelan man, referred to as A.S.R., filed a habeas corpus petition last month asking her to stop the government from deporting him.",
      "The man's lawyers say he was detained by ICE agents, asked about his tattoos and accused of links to Tren de Aragua, which he strongly denies. He was later moved to Texas. The petition says the man \u2014 who entered the U.S. in 2023 and is seeking asylum \u2014 fears the government will try to use the Alien Enemies Act against him.",
      "Why is Judge Haines' Alien Enemies Act ruling unusual?",
      "Haines is the first judge to explicitly say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants, making the Pennsylvania jurist an \"outlier among all of the other federal courts,\" says Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee.",
      "Judges in three other states \u2014 Texas, Colorado and New York \u2014 have blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in their court districts. In some of these cases, the judges have said outright that the Trump administration's use of the 1798 law is likely illegal, often concluding that Tren de Aragua likely isn't involved in an invasion under the law.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein of Manhattan rejected the government's arguments. His ruling also took aim at the Trump administration for transporting hundreds of Alien Enemies Act subjects to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador under a deal with that country's government, calling it a \"notoriously evil jail.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, a University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor who has worked on cases involving the Alien Enemies Act, called Haines' ruling \"wrong on a couple of key points.\"",
      "He says it gives too much legal weight to the fact that the Trump administration considers Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, calling it \"deeply misguided\" and at odds with other rulings on terrorism designations. He also believes Haines gives excessive deference to the administration on whether an invasion is taking place.",
      "\"If every group of individuals \u2026 who the U.S. government says are controlled by a foreign government can be therefore treated as an invading force, then the Alien Enemies Act power is truly unbounded,\" Arulanantham told CBS News.",
      "Georgetown Law School Professor David Super also questioned the amount of deference that Haines gave the administration, including on the questions of whether Tren de Aragua is invading the U.S. and whether the Venezuelan government is responsible.",
      "\"This is involving individual liberties, and sweeping deference to the executive to abridge individual liberties is not part of our tradition,\" Super told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have defended his use of the law, arguing it's a necessary tool to deport Tren de Aragua members and halt gang violence. His March proclamation said Tren de Aragua members have \"unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\"",
      "Tren de Aragua \"is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said.",
      "In court papers, the administration has argued it is \"the President's call alone\" whether the Alien Enemies Act applies, and whether the U.S. faces a \"predatory incursion\" is the type of foreign policy decision that's typically left to the president. The government's lawyers have also said the term \"predatory incursion\" can apply to Tren de Aragua members, arguing it can have a broader definition than just military action.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Haines' ruling.",
      "What does Judge Haines' ruling mean for migrants?",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow because \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it appears to only impact the Venezuelan man who initially brought the habeas corpus petition.",
      "In an earlier ruling last month, the judge treated the case as a class action, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from removing anybody from western Pennsylvania under the Alien Enemies Act unless they've received 14 days' notice.",
      "But Haines wrote Tuesday that there is no evidence anyone in her court district is currently being held under the law \u2014 including the man who brought the case, since he was transferred to Texas last month. For that reason, she narrowed the case to just the one petitioner.",
      "\"My read of it is that Judge Haines' order is extremely limited,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Mukherjee also noted that Haines' ruling still requires the administration to give migrants plenty of notice \u2014 a view that other courts have held, including the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Universally, the federal courts are trying to curb the executive branch's reliance on the Alien Enemies Act as a mechanism for swift deportations from the United States without providing meaningful due process and notice to people,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Still, Arulanantham said the ruling will be \"enormously significant\" if it's upheld on appeal.",
      "If the government can keep using the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members, but those migrants can challenge their detentions in court based on the specific facts of their situation, it could \"become an enormous drain on the legal system,\" requiring judges to hold a \"mini-trial\" for each planned removal, Arulanantham said.",
      "Has the Supreme Court ruled on the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Supreme Court hasn't weighed in directly on the question of whether the Alien Enemies Act is being used properly, but it has said the government needs to give migrants held under the law a chance at judicial review \u2014 which Haines' ruling cites.",
      "The high court handed down that ruling in April. In the same order, the justices overturned a ruling from a Washington, D.C., judge blocking Alien Enemies Act removals \u2014 but the Supreme Court focused on whether the judge had jurisdiction over migrants held in Texas, not on whether the Trump administration was allowed to use the 1798 law.",
      "The court also temporarily blocked Alien Enemies Act rulings in one part of Texas last month, in a brief emergency order that still remains in effect.",
      "Super believes the Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on the Alien Enemies Act again \u2014 possibly before its summer recess.",
      "\"This is certainly going back to the Supreme Court sooner rather than later,\" Super said.",
      "Can the Trump administration suspend habeas corpus?",
      "Many of the cases challenging the Alien Enemies Act are brought under writs of habeas corpus \u2014 a centuries-old legal concept that grants people the right to challenge their imprisonment.",
      "Last week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, citing a provision of the Constitution that allows it to be suspended \"in cases of rebellion or invasion.\" That step has only been taken under extremely rare circumstances in the past, including during the Civil War.",
      "Many legal experts believe the idea of suspending habeas corpus to deal with illegal immigration is unlikely to pass legal muster. Super told CBS News the gambit would put \"an even higher burden on the administration that we are at war.\"",
      "\"Habeas corpus goes all the way back to the Magna Carta,\" Super said. \"I think courts will be very concerned about discarding a provision that is 800 years old in defense of our liberties.\"",
      "It's also widely believed that suspensions of habeas corpus must be authorized by Congress.",
      "\"There are centuries of case law on this question,\" Mukherjee said. \"If the executive branch tries to suspend habeas corpus, that would be unconstitutional and illegal, and a dramatic escalation of the authoritarian overreach of the executive branch.\"",

    "summary": "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans Wednesday moved forward with a tax bill to cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding, reduce regulations and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits as part of President Trump's \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Cuts would impact businesses and consumers, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency and electric vehicles. Concurrently, House Republicans proposed streamlining permitting for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act has led to $321 billion worth of climate investment being completed, with $522 billion worth of investments still in process, according to a report from the Clean Investment Monitor. Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.",
      "Four Republican senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a \"full-scale repeal\" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.",
      "Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter\u00a0in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went toward Republican congressional districts.",
      "Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.",
      "\"I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,\" he told CBS News.",
      "His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.",
      "Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.",
      "\"Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,\" Belur told CBS News. \"I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.\"",
      "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.",
      "\"At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that Mr. Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.",
      "Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports and environmental justice grants.",
      "Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.",
      "\"This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,\" Chapman told CBS News. \"What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is moving forward on President Trump's \"one, big beautiful bill,\" as three committees on Wednesday voted to advance some of the most contentious parts of the major budget package aimed at addressing the president's defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "The Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Agriculture committees met Tuesday and Wednesday to debate and vote on their proposals as Republicans remained divided on a number of major issues \u2014 from Medicaid to tax cuts.",
      "Ways and Means faces SALT conflict",
      "After a nearly 18-hour markup, the Ways and Means panel, which is responsible for the tax portions of the bill, advanced its portion of the legislation Wednesday morning, in a 26-19 vote. But the key sticking point, a cap on the state and local tax deduction, often referred to as SALT, appeared to go unresolved. Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the $10,000 cap, but balked at a proposed $30,000 cap in recent days.",
      "On SALT, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday morning that he's serving as the \"neutral umpire\" in the conversations between red state and blue state Republicans, adding that \"I'm absolutely confident we're going to be able to work out a compromise that everybody can live with.\"",
      "Energy and Commerce deals with Medicaid",
      "Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce Committee debated for more than 25 hours before advancing its portion of the legislation in a 30-24 vote on Wednesday afternoon. The panel was tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts, which has implicated the popular entitlement program Medicaid.",
      "The Energy and Commerce proposal, unveiled Monday night, would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cuts to federal funding to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and a ban on Medicaid covering gender transition services for children.",
      "Agriculture Committee votes on food stamp changes",
      "The Agriculture Committee \u2014 tasked with finding $230 billion in cuts \u2014 also voted on its portion of the bill Wednesday evening, passing it in a 29-25 party-line vote after a process that began late Tuesday.",
      "The most contentious issue handled by the Agriculture panel surrounds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, widely known as food stamps. The committee's proposal would increase the age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits, while shifting more of the costs to states. The bill updates the age requirement to 64, up from 54.",
      "Republicans also want to close a loophole for work requirement waivers that states could request for areas with unemployment rates over 10% or lack \"a sufficient number of jobs.\"",
      "House aims for vote next week \u2014 but Senate still needs to weigh in",
      "House GOP leadership celebrated the committee stage nearing a close in their weekly presser Wednesday morning.",
      "\"A lot of work has gone into getting 11 committees ready to complete all of their work today,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said.",
      "Republican leaders have been pushing to have the bill on the floor by next week, with the House Budget Committee expected to meet in the coming days to put the bill's components into one massive legislative package. After that, the measure would then go to the House Rules Committee before it can be brought to the floor for a vote.",
      "\"This process isn't over. We're just getting close to maybe half time,\" Scalise said. \"When we pass this bill next week through the House, it will go to the Senate, they'll do their work. But we will get this bill to President Trump's desk before the July 4 deadline that the White House has asked for.\"",
      "Johnson also touted the progress on the legislation so far Wednesday, calling it \"one of the most consequential pieces of legislation ever passed by the United States Congress.\"",
      "\"It is large, it is comprehensive, and it deals with reconciling the budget in a way that will be fiscally responsible,\" Johnson said.",
      "Still, across the Capitol, a handful of Senate Republicans began expressing concerns about the House's legislation, prompting discussions about seemingly inevitable changes to the package in the upper chamber.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that he hopes the House sends over legislation that the upper chamber can \"use as a base.\"",
      "\"I think we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this,\" Thune said, noting that they have been coordinating closely with the House. \"Obviously there's 53 Republican senators who want to have their own thoughts and ideas incorporated.\"",

    "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as California faces a steep budget deficit.",
    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as the state faces economic uncertainty.",
      "Newsom outlined his nearly $332 billion state spending plan on Wednesday, revealing that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit.",
      "\"California is under assault,\" Newsom said. \"We have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines.\"",
      "The Democratic governor noted that the freeze does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants.",
      "\"No state has done more than the state of California, no state will continue to do more than the state of California by a long shot. And that's a point of pride,\" Newsom said.",
      "The decision, the details for which were revealed before Wednesday's budget revision presentation, is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies, Newsom said. It also comes as Newsom faces his final years in the governor's office, with speculation continuing to mount about his future political prospects.",
      "California's push to offer free health care benefits to all low-income adults, regardless of their immigration status, was announced in late 2023. Newsom touted the planned expansion as \"a transformative step towards strengthening the health care system for all Californians.\"",
      "However, the cost has exceeded the state's initial $6.4 billion estimate by more than $2 billion.",
      "Still, as late as March of this year, Newsom suggested to reporters he was not considering rolling back health benefits for low-income people living in the country illegally \u2014 even with California grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom's office didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \"unsatisfactory immigration status\" on Medi-Cal, including those without legal status and those who have legal status but aren't eligible for federally funded Medicaid, will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\"We believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "In total, Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion-dollar hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "The proposals come ahead of Newsom's scheduled presentation on the updated budget. Recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, changing federal tariff policies, and the expensive health care expansion are putting a strain on California's massive state budget. Lawmakers are expecting a multibillion-dollar shortfall this year, and more deficits are projected for several years ahead.",
      "Newsom blamed President Donald Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls, estimating that the polices have cost the state $16 billion in tax revenues. California is also bracing for major budget hits if Republicans in Congress follow through with a plan to slash billions of dollars in Medicaid and penalize states for providing health care to immigrants without legal status.",
      "Newsom now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it's unclear how Democrats who control the Legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California's budget is by far the largest among states.",
      "\"This is going to be a very challenging budget,\" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who chairs the budget committee, said before Newsom's proposals were announced. \"We're going to have to make some tough decisions.\"",
      "The budget proposals presented this week will build on some of the impacts of federal policies, but many unknowns remain.",
      "The governor already said he's planning to scale back on baseline spending this year. Analysts and economists also warn that California will face bigger deficits in the tens of billions of dollars in the coming years due to economic sluggishness and stock market volatility brought on by the tariff war.",
      "The budget Newsom first proposed in January included little new spending. But it allows the state to fully implement the country's first universal transitional kindergarten program and increase the state's film and TV tax credit to $750 million annually to bring back Hollywood jobs that have gone to New York and Georgia. He recently called on Trump to pass a $7.5 billion film tax credit at the federal level.",
      "Last year, Newsom and the Legislature agreed to dip into the state's rainy day fund, slash spending \u2014 including a nearly 10% cut for nearly all state departments \u2014 and temporarily raise taxes on some businesses to close an estimated $46.8 billion budget deficit.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government to give the country \"a chance at peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, al-Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Al-Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite al-Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with al-Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of al-Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering al-Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",

    "summary": "Georgia's \"heartbeat law\" \u200bis among the restrictive abortion statutes that have been put in place in many conservative states.",
    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead after a medical emergency has been on life support for three months to let the fetus grow enough to be delivered, a move her family says a hospital told them was required under the state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "With her due date still more than three months away, it could be one of the longest such pregnancies. Her family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.",
      "Georgia's\u00a0\"heartbeat law\" is among the restrictive abortion statutes that have been put in place in many conservative states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\u00a0three years ago.",
      "Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was declared brain-dead - meaning she is legally dead - in February, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than three months ago and went to Atlanta's Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead.",
      "Newkirk said Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would likely kill the fetus.",
      "Northside did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Emory Healthcare said it could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules, but released a statement saying it \"uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\"",
      "Smith's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected - generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v. Wade\u00a0was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, opening the door to state abortion bans. Twelve states are enforcing bans on\u00a0abortion\u00a0at all stages of pregnancy and three others have bans like Georgia's that kick in after about six weeks.",
      "Like the others, Georgia's ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman's life. Those exceptions have been at the heart of legal and political questions, including a major Texas Supreme Court ruling last year that found the ban there applies even when there are major pregnancy complications.",
      "Smith's family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.",
      "Newkirk told WXIA that doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.",
      "\"She's pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he's born,\" Newkirk said. She has not said whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.",
      "Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's abortion law, said the situation is problematic.",
      "\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\" Simpson said in a statement. \"Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\"",
      "Lois Shepherd, a bioethicist and law professor at the University of Virginia, said she does not believe life support is legally required in this case.",
      "But she said whether a state could insist Smith remains on life support is uncertain since the overturning of Roe, which found that fetuses do not have the rights of people.",
      "\"Pre-Dobbs, a fetus didn't have any rights,\" Shepherd said. \"And the state's interest in fetal life could not be so strong as to overcome other important rights, but now we don't know.\"",
      "The situation echoes a case in Texas more than a decade ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on life support for about two months because she was pregnant. A judge eventually ruled that the hospital was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.",
      "Brain death in pregnancy is rare. Even rarer still are cases in which doctors aim to prolong the pregnancy after a woman is declared brain-dead.",
      "\"It's a very complex situation, obviously, not only ethically but also medically,\" said Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, director of maternal fetal medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.",
      "A 2021 review that Berghella co-authored scoured medical literature going back decades for cases in which doctors declared a woman brain-dead and aimed to prolong her pregnancy. It found 35.",
      "Of those, 27 resulted in a live birth, the majority either immediately declared healthy or with normal follow-up tests. But Berghella also cautioned that the Georgia case was much more difficult because the pregnancy was less far along when the woman was declared brain dead. In the 35 cases he studied, doctors were able to prolong the pregnancy by an average of just seven weeks before complications forced them to intervene.",
      "\"It's just hard to keep the mother out of infection, out of cardiac failure,\" he said.",
      "Berghella also found a case from Germany that resulted in a live birth when the woman was declared brain dead at nine weeks of pregnancy - about as far along as Smith was when she died.",
      "Georgia's law confers personhood on a fetus. Those who favor personhood say fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses should be considered people with the same rights as those already born.",
      "Georgia state Sen. Ed Setzler, a Republican who sponsored the 2019 law, said he supported Emory's interpretation.",
      "\"I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,\" Setzler said. \"I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\"",
      "Setzler said he believes it is sometimes acceptable to remove life support from someone who is brain dead, but that the law is \"an appropriate check\" because the mother is pregnant. He said Smith's relatives have \"good choices,\" including keeping the child or offering it for adoption.",
      "Georgia's abortion ban has been in the spotlight before.",
      "Last year, ProPublica reported that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills. The stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller\u00a0entered into the presidential race, with Democrat Kamala Harris saying the deaths were the result of the abortion bans that went into effect in Georgia and elsewhere after Dobbs.",

      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",

      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",

Glenn Detention Center in Richland County, where she remains in custody, the facility's website shows.",
      "Hill's attorney, Will Lewis of the South Carolina-based firm Richardson Thomas, LLC, said Thursday they \"will not be releasing a comment at this time.\"",
      "Murdaugh, 56, was convicted in 2023 of murdering his wife and youngest son. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, which he is serving alongside a separate 27-year sentence for financial crimes.",

      "In 2024, Murdaugh's attorneys appealed the murder and weapons charges because they claimed Hill violated ethics codes and prejudiced jurors to allegedly presume their client's guilt. The attorneys also accused Hill of allowing her personal motives to influence her professional conduct to promote a book she co-authored on the trial.",

      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",
      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",

    "story": [
      "One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Grouette spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn't land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \"It was this implied, 'You're stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "Indeed, despite the unemployment rate still hovering at a historic low\u00a0at 4.2%, for an increasing number of out-of-work Americans, it's taking longer to find a new job. Meanwhile, the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.",
      "Grouette, however, eventually found a way out of her toxic workplace. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she was working a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\"You can't put a price tag on it,\" she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\"",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\"We're developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\" said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Disagreement vs. abuse",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \"if I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a 'Suck it up' attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \"I don't think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\"",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\"What makes something toxic: It's more pervasive, more consistent over time,\" Tosti-Kharas said. \"You may have tried some things and it's not getting better. ... It's very deeply entrenched.\"",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\"It is a relationship where you can't communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can't say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\" Atchison said.",
      "Follow your gut",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\"I'm reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I'm applying to, because I can't lose my hair again over a job,\" said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\"It's almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\" Atchison said. \"If someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\"",
      "More complaints since COVID-19",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\"Socializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "Document your concerns",
      "\"Don't hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you're talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don't internalize it. And don't take someone's perception as fact.\"",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \"I'm going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\" she said. \"Is there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else's opinion?\"",
      "Human resources may or may not help",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \"In the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it's you who has to go somewhere,\" Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \"you wouldn't say, 'Let me try to work with the radon,' or 'How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?'\" she said. \"You would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\"",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\"If somebody gives you an impression that you're not able to leave this job, that's just not true,\" Grouette said. \"Those sorts of people don't have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they're volatile to you, they're volatile to others.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 16:22:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation now winding its way through the House includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, as well as sharply lowering lowering rates on corporations. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "A Texas mother was arrested this week on allegations she purchased ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who authorities said was planning \"mass targeted violence\" at a San Antonio school, according to an affidavit obtained by CBS News.",
      "Ashley Pardo, 33, was arrested Monday on one count of aiding in the commission of terrorism after tactical gear and ammunition were found at her home, which authorities said she purchased for her son in exchange for babysitting his younger siblings, according to the arrest affidavit issued by Bexar County Magistrate Court.",
      "Pardo \"intentionally and knowingly aided\" her son, San Antonio police wrote in the affidavit.",
      "The situation unfolded in January, when school staff at Jeremiah Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio found a map of the school which had been allegedly drawn by Pardo's 13-year-old son, who was not named in the affidavit.",
      "The map was labeled \"suicide route,\" with the name of the school and a rifle drawn above it, according to the affidavit. The boy told officials that he had a \"fascination with past mass shooters, including their manifestos.\"",
      "San Antonio police said Thursday that Child Protective Services became involved with the family after the drawing was found, but Pardo appeared dismissive of her son's behavior.",
      "In April, the boy was suspended from school for using a school-issued computer to research the 2019 massacre on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, according to the affidavit.",
      "The boy was \"subsequently suspended,\" and later in the day attempted suicide, the affidavit states. He attended an alternative school through May 7, and returned to his Jeremiah Rhodes on May 8.",
      "On Monday, the boy's grandmother contacted police after the middle schooler told her that Pardo gave him guns and ammunition, according to the affidavit. The grandmother had found her grandson playing with a live bullet and a hammer the day prior, the documents read.",
      "The grandmother told police that Pardo had taken her son to a surplus store and bought him tactical gear, including magazines, a tactical vest, a tactical helmet and army clothing.",
      "\"It has been expressed to the Defendant the concerns of her child's expression and desire to commit acts of mass violence,\" the affidavit stated about Pardo. \"The Defendant expressed to the school her support of (her son's) violent expressions and drawings and does not feel concerned for his behavior.\"",
      "The grandmother also found a homemade explosive device made from a mortar-style firework in the boy's bedroom, the affidavit said. Written on the device were the words \"For Brenton Tarrant,\" the Australian white supremacist who carried out the Christchurch shootings that killed 51 people.",
      "Multiple \"SS\" symbols and \"14 words\" were also written on the device, according to the affidavit, references to white supremacist ideology.",
      "On Monday, before going to school, the boy told his grandmother that he was \"going to be famous.\" He went to school \"wearing a mask, camouflage jacket and tactical pants,\" but left shortly afterwards, the affidavit reads.",
      "He was later detained off-campus, the school said in a note to parents.",
      "\"Please know we take all potential threats seriously and act immediately to protect everyone in our care,\" the school's principal said in the note.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has resorted to buying replacement parts on eBay and making new parts with 3D printers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers Thursday \u2014 as the air safety system draws scrutiny for decades-old technology and persistent staffing problems.",
      "\"We do try to buy replacement parts on eBay for this really old equipment,\" Duffy told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Thursday. \"Sometimes, we can't even buy it on eBay, so we're trying to use 3D printing to craft replacement parts for the system that we use.\"",
      "Duffy made similar comments on \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, saying the FAA has turned to eBay because \"we can't buy parts for new\" for some of the agency's aging systems.",
      "Duffy appeared at the Senate hearing as the Trump administration pushes for a sweeping overhaul of the country's air traffic control system over the next three years, calling for the replacement of hundreds of radars, over a dozen new control towers and a new telecommunications system. The plan could cost \"lots of billions,\" Duffy said last week, likely requiring Congress to appropriate additional funds for the FAA.",
      "Air safety has entered the fore after a series of jarring incidents. Dozens of people were killed in a January collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport. And in recent weeks, the FAA facility that handles the airspace near Newark Liberty International Airport has been plagued by staffing shortages and equipment outages, leading to severe delays at the busy airport.",
      "\"We are facing a crisis,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the appropriations panel.",
      "Duffy told lawmakers Thursday air travel in the U.S. is still safe, citing \"multiple redundancies\" \u2014 but he acknowledged the air traffic control system needs an overhaul.",
      "\"The system we currently use, it truly is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We should've paid way more attention to it as a country,\" Duffy said Thursday. \"We've let it age, and now we're seeing the cracks of that age play out in real time for us.\"",
      "Duffy also pushed back on criticism that job cuts at the FAA could end up impacting safety. The agency laid off several hundred probationary staff earlier this year, amid a wider effort by the Trump administration to shrink the federal workforce. A union representing some FAA workers told the Associated Press in February the cuts affected mechanics and other specialists who help support the work of air traffic controllers and safety inspectors.",
      "\"You can have all your air traffic controllers there, but if they don't have the support staff, we can't know that they're doing the job,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.",
      "Murray also cited reports that air traffic controllers were mistakenly sent an email earlier this year offering them buyouts to leave their jobs, which she said was \"really callous.\"",
      "Duffy said the agency has not cut any air traffic controllers, and the layoffs and voluntary buyouts that hit the federal workforce earlier this year excluded safety positions. \"We've been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,\" Duffy told lawmakers.",

      "The report, which comes from Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an organization focused on babies' exposure to toxic chemicals, found arsenic in 100% of rice samples purchased from stores across the U.S.",
      "One in four rice samples also exceeded the federal limit of 100 parts per billion (ppb) of inorganic arsenic set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for infant rice cereal in 2021, according to the report.",
      "\"No such limit exists for rice itself - the bags and boxes of rice served at family meals - despite it being widely consumed by infants and toddlers,\" the authors note.",
      "Overall, the levels of total heavy metals, including cadmium, lead and mercury, ranged, on average, from 63 ppb to 188 pbb among the rice samples \u2014 though some samples exceeded 240 ppb, for example.",
      "The report tested 105 different brands, including Trader Joe's, Ben's and Goya, from 20 metro areas across the country, from New York City to Los Angeles and Miami. Of the four toxic heavy metals found, arsenic was found at the highest levels and cadmium was second. Lead and mercury were found at the lowest levels.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS News, the USA Rice Federation said Thursday, \"We know that arsenic in food is alarming for many consumers and that you may have questions.  And while we do not agree that there is a public health safety issue as a result of trace amounts of arsenic in rice, we will continue to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any threshold established.\"",
      "Very low levels of inorganic and organic arsenic are found in many food products, according to the National Institutes of Health.",

      "Cook rice like pasta: \"Research shows that cooking rice in 6 to 10 cups of water per 1 cup of rice and draining the excess water before eating can remove a significant amount of arsenic,\" the report read.",
      "Use rice alternatives: The organization's testing found alternatives such as quinoa, barley and couscous contain lower levels of total heavy metals.",
      "Choose your rice wisely: The organization also found some types of rice had higher levels of heavy metals and elements than others. They suggest opting for Calrose, sushi, and white rice grown in California, along with jasmine rice from Thailand or Basmati rice from India, while avoiding those found to have higher levels, such as brown rice, white rice grown in the Southeast U.S. and arborio rice (risotto) from Italy.",

China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\"",

Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",

That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found.

Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\" said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \"Customers don't care what color our clothes are when they're waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\"",
      "Most stores remain open",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-forever-chemicals-rollback-drinking-water/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:42:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Dissatisfied environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.",
      "Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.",
      "\"You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured,\" she said.",
      "When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.",
      "Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.",
      "\"This current administration promised voters it would 'Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,\" she said.",

      "EMTs had found Smith barely conscious and unable to say anything about the shooting. They rushed him to the hospital and deputies searched the house. Later that day, crime scene investigator Josh Easton of the Illinois State Police was called to the scene and he began cataloging the mayhem inside.",

      "Sharon Costanza: I think Tiki protected Chris \u2026 I think she probably laid right next to him \u2026",
      "Smith's close-knit family could not imagine anyone wanting to kill him.",
      "Ashli Holcomb: It was like, no way. How? Why?",
      "Sharon Costanza: Who? Yeah. Who would've done that?",
      "Investigators had the same questions about Reeves and learned that she was a divorced mother of two children who lived in Troy, about an hour south of Farmersville. Although Reeves had a master's degree in engineering, she chose instead to teach Pilates and to promote self-defense classes for women.",

That night, sheriff's deputies went to Tarr's home in Collinsville, an hour south of the crime scene. Authorities say he never asked why they wanted to talk to him, and he agreed to go to the police station without a lawyer.",

      "That's exactly what they did. Detectives brought Tarr's 17-year-old daughter Shelby to a different room at the police station. And she told them that her father actually left home twice that night.",
      "DET. TYSON HOLSHOUSER: So the first time he left was roughly 6:30?",
      "SHELBY TARR: Right.",

      "SHELBY TARR: He gets home, he was crying. He was sobbing. \u2026 He said he missed Leslie.",
      "Shelby said she went sleep around 9:30 p.m. and was awakened by her father around 2:45 a.m.",
      "SHELBY TARR: He started laundry, he was pacing, walking around \u2026 And he was like, I can't sleep.",
      "Detectives went back to Tarr and told him Shelby's story didn't match his. Tarr then changed his story and said he had gone to his friend's house twice, but still insisted he was home by 8 p.m. As Tarr sat at the police station, detectives searched his house and found his phone and a Glock pistol. Shelby had told them her father had a different gun, but they did not find it.",
      "SHELBY TARR: It's little, it's like this big. \u2026 Not like a light green, but like a \u2014 the Army green.",
      "Shelby told investigators she had seen it the day before Thanksgiving \u2013 in her father's sock drawer.",
      "SHELBY TARR: Yesterday morning, actually, I went to get socks and it was there. And now it's not there.",
      "DET. TYSON HOLSHOUSER: Was there yesterday, gone today?",
      "SHELBY TARR: Yeah.",
      "Bobby Tarr sat at the police station overnight while authorities continued to investigate. They had already learned his car had been captured by license plate reader cameras just after midnight the night of the shooting. The cameras were near a gas station, and investigators discovered that Tarr had bought gas there just after midnight. Back at the police station, they confronted him with the gas station receipt.",
      "DETECTIVE. #2: So you're a liar.",

      "Amy Steinhauer: She was terrified of him, rightfully so.",
      "Just a few weeks earlier, Steinhauer says, Reeves told her that Tarr had shown up while she was on a first date with a different guy. After that incident, Reeves told Steinhauer she was frightened by Tarr and texted Steinhauer: \"I could be killed by him someday if I don't cut all contact.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, you're telling me now that this woman who was scared of you, who had actually texted a friend that she thought you might kill her, asked you to follow her to another man's house?",

      "A few days later they got another phone call. This time from Tarr's brother, asking them to come back to the house. Tarr's family gave deputies a Ziploc bag they said they had found in the same yard that had been searched just days earlier. Inside \u2014 a Springfield Hellcat 9 mm pistol and silver-colored ammunition. The Illinois State Police determined the gun was the murder weapon and the ammunition matched the casings found at the crime scene.",

      "When Bobby Tarr went on trial in April 2024, prosecutors told the jury that he killed Leslie Reeves rather than allow her to live the life she wanted; a life without him.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: Mr. Tarr \u2026 couldn't deal with the fact that Leslie was seeing somebody else and \u2026 he had to go and take care of it.",
      "Andrew Affrunti says Tarr secretly followed Reeves to Farmersville early that evening, and shortly afterwards his phone began showing some interesting activity.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: He had actually searched Chris Smith on his phone, had tried to find his Facebook profile.",
      "Tarr headed home and texted his friend Billy Adams, \"I don't feel like she would drive that far for a party or go out with a girlfriend. I think it's for a dude.\" He also searched whether police could track his phone if he was using a VPN \u2013 a virtual private network.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: He was researching to determine whether or not that would mask where his location was while he was using the phone.",
      "Authorities say around midnight, Tarr left home, stopping at that gas station. And then, according to Affrunti, surveillance videos and cell tower records show that Tarr drove back to Farmersville.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You believe he intended to kill both Chris and Leslie?",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I 100% believe that he went up there with the intent to do serious harm to both of them.",
      "With one victim dead and the other with no memory, it's difficult to say with certainty what happened. But the prosecution argued that sometime after 1 a.m., Tarr tried to enter through the back door of Smith's house. Reeves and Smith tried to keep him out.",
      "Josh Easton: There was some kind of altercation or struggle \u2026And that's when the glass was broken.",
      "Crime scene investigator Josh Easton told the jury what he'd observed inside the kitchen.",
      "Josh Easton: The refrigerator was pulled away from the wall from where it appeared it normally was.",
      "Prosecutors believe Reeves was trying to use the refrigerator to block the door. And based on where Smith was shot in his head, they think he was crouching down to help Reeves.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I think that \u2026 while Chris was crouched down trying to hold the door shut, uh, Bobby shot through the door and struck Chris.",
      "With Smith incapacitated, Affrunti says Reeves hid in the living room. Tarr tracked her down, shot and killed her.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I strongly believe that \u2026 he walked in and executed her.",
      "Defense attorney Dan Fultz disputes all of that.",
      "Dan Fultz: There is simply no evidence \u2026 that that's what happened. There's no evidence that Leslie pushed the refrigerator. There's no fingerprints and blood \u2026 on the refrigerator of Leslie's.",
      "Fultz says evidence of a fight in the kitchen tells a different story.",
      "Dan Fultz: The amount of blood in that kitchen was astonishing.",
      "Erin Moriarty: From looking at that crime scene, do you believe that Christopher Smith had to fight his -- his assailant \u2026 in the kitchen?",
      "Dan Fultz: It would appear to me that there was \u2026 some significant struggle in that kitchen between him and someone else.",
      "And he says the assailant could not have been Tarr because he would have been covered in blood.",
      "Dan Fultz: They did not identify a single piece of DNA in his car, they didn't identify a bloody fingerprint, they did not identify anything tying him to that crime scene.",
      "But prosecutors argued the house wasn't bloody when Tarr left. They said Chris bled heavily in the 12 hours it took for help to arrive. And while the prosecution did not have a lot of forensic evidence linking Tarr to the crime scene, Affrunti says his phone activity, his lies to investigators, and the evidence found on the Hellcat all prove his guilt.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: When you put all of that together, that's when you get the clear picture of what happened.",
      "When it was the defense's turn, Tarr says he wanted to tell his story to the jury. But he chose not to testify.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why didn't you just decide you were gonna talk to the jury and tell this story, if in fact you have a story to tell?",
      "Bobby Tarr: I should have, I very well should have.",
      "Dan Fultz: We made a strategic decision \u2026 because it may have opened the door for a whole lot of other more damaging evidence to be used, to cross examine him.",
      "The defense didn't put on any witnesses and counted on the jury to find reasonable doubt in the lack of physical evidence. After three hours, the jury found Bobby Tarr guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder.",
      "Two months later, Tarr was back in court for sentencing, and this time, so was Smith -- to tell the judge how the shooting impacted him and his family. Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom.",
      "Chris Smith (after sentencing) Lost my house, lost my truck \u2026 I mean, I've literally lost my life without being killed.",
      "While Smith was in a coma, he says looters descended on his house and stole his guitar and amps, even his above ground pool. Later, his house was sold at auction and then razed. All that's left is an empty lot.",
      "Tarr also spoke at his sentencing and denied shooting Reeves and Smith. The judge sentenced him to 85 years.",

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week criticized White South Africans who claimed refugee status in the U.S. as \"cowardly.\"",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according to BBC News.",
      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",
      "Must be of South African nationality; and\u00a0Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and\u00a0Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.",

      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",

      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",
      "Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary \"Chris Brown: A History of Violence.\"",

      "\"I think sometime later this year, and hopefully on the sooner, and hopefully much sooner than late this year, we'll see large breakthroughs in Iran,\" Wright said. \"Look, this is a win, win deal. Iran agrees to completely give up their nuclear program. They can have trade, they can have engagement with the rest of the world. They can bring down rampant inflation.

      "Mexico's security chief confirmed Tuesday that 17 family members of cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. last week as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration.",
      "Mexican Security Secretary Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch confirmed a report by independent journalist Luis Chaparro that family members of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n Lopez, who was extradited to the United States in 2023, had entered the U.S.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n Lopez is one of the brothers left running a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel after notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n was imprisoned in the U.S. Video showed the family members walking across the border from Tijuana with their suitcases to waiting U.S. agents.",
      "El Chapo's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez Perez, and her daughter were among the family members to enter the U.S.,\u00a0Mexico News Daily reported.",
      "Rumors had circulated last week that the younger Guzm\u00e1n would plead guilty to avoid trial for several drug trafficking charges in the U.S. after being extradited in 2023. Mexican security forces\u00a0captured Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, alias \"the Mouse,\" in January 2023 in Culiac\u00e1n, capital of Sinaloa state.",
      "Garc\u00eda Harfuch confirmed the family members' crossing in a radio interview and said it was clear to Mexican authorities that they were doing so after negotiations between Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and the U.S. government.",
      "He believed that was the case because the former cartel boss, whose lawyer said in January he had entered negotiations with U.S. authorities, had been pointing fingers at members of other criminal organizations likely as part of a cooperation agreement.",
      "\"It is evident that his family is going to the U.S. because of a negotiation or an offer that the Department of Justice is giving him,\" Garcia Harfuch said.",
      "He said that none of the family members were being pursued by Mexican authorities and that the government of President Trump \"has to share information\" with Mexican prosecutors, something it has not yet done.",
      "The confirmation by Garc\u00eda Harfuch comes the same day that the U.S. Attorney General's Office announced it was charging a number of top cartel leaders with \"narcoterrorism\" for the first time since the Trump administration declared a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "While prosecutors declined to comment on the video of the family, U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California and other officials sent a warning to cartel members, repeatedly citing the Sinaloa Cartel by name.",
      "\"Let me be direct, to the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, you are no longer the hunters, you are the hunted. You will be betrayed by your friends, you will be hounded by your enemies, and you will ultimately find yourself and your face here in a courtroom in the Southern District of California,\" Gordon said.",
      "Also on Tuesday, U.S. officials unveiled an indictment against two alleged Sinaloa Cartel leaders on narco-terrorism charges \u2014 including a father and son who prosecutors say ran one of the largest and most sophisticated fentanyl production networks.",
      "EL Chapo's sons",
      "The U.S. accuses El Chapo's sons \u2014 known as the Chapitos \u2014 of taking over the Sinaloa cartel after the capture of their father. The cartel is one of six Mexican drug trafficking groups designated terrorist organizations by Mr. Trump.",
      "According to a 2023 indictment by the U.S. Justice Department, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Ovidio Guzman is accused of conspiring to ship cocaine, fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States.",
      "Another son, Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n Lopez, was arrested after arriving in the United States last July in a private plane with cartel co-founder Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, who claimed he had been kidnapped.",
      "The arrests sparked cartel infighting that has left more than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missing in Sinaloa state, located in northwestern Mexico.",
      "El Chapo, the Sinaloa cartel's founder, is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison in Colorado after being\u00a0convicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.",

Kseniia Petrova  , 30, was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana after her February arrest. She continues to await a judge's decision on whether she will be deported to Russia, where she fears she will be imprisoned or worse. A hearing on her case was held Wednesday in Vermont.",

      "A lawyer for Petrova could not be reached for comment. It is unclear if she is being moved from the ICE facility.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government to give the country \"a chance at peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, al-Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Al-Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite al-Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with al-Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of al-Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering al-Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thai officials on Wednesday said they seized 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at the port of Bangkok, one of the biggest lots they've found this year.",
      "The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap containing aluminium, copper and iron, but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department.",
      "The electronic waste \u2014 which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal \u2014 was found on Tuesday after the 40-foot containers became the subject of a routine random inspection, officials said.",
      "The Basel Convention is an international treaty signed in 1989 meant to deal with hazardous waste flowing into developing countries as costs for disposal grew along with the amount of waste.",
      "A U.N. report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure.",
      "Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to re-export the waste back to its country of origin.",
      "\"It's important that we take action on this kind of goods,\" he said. \"There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.\"",
      "Electronic waste creates huge\u00a0health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals.",
      "Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.",
      "Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste. Last year, Thai officials found thousands of tons of smuggled cadmium waste at a factory in the province, Thai PBS reported.",
      "Residents near the area were later found to have usually high levels of the poisonous metal in their urine, according to the report. Exposure to cadmium can cause flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever and muscle pain, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Long-term exposure can lead to cancer, kidney, bone and lung disease.",
      "In January, the Customs Department said it seized 256 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from Japan and Hong Kong at a port in eastern Thailand.",

      "A 2-year-old girl separated from her parents by deportation arrived on Wednesday in Venezuela, where her mother was deported from the United States \u2014 a move that the South American country has repeatedly denounced as a kidnapping.",
      "Maikelys Espinoza arrived at an airport outside the capital, Caracas, along with more than 220 deported migrants.",
      "Footage aired by state television showed Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores carrying Maikelys at the airport. Later, Flores was shown handing the girl over to her mother, who had been waiting for her arrival at the presidential palace along with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The U.S. government had claimed the family separation last month was justified because the girl's parents allegedly have ties to the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang, which President Trump designated a terrorist organization earlier this year.",
      "The toddler's return has been \"a battle every day and today we have a great victory,\" Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said at the airport Wednesday, Reuters reported.",
      "The girl's mother was deported to Venezuela on April 25. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities sent her father to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March under Mr. Trump's invocation of an 18th-century wartime law to deport hundreds of immigrants.",
      "For years, the government of Maduro had mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. But since Mr. Trump took office this year, hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have been deported to their home country.",
      "Maduro on Wednesday thanked Mr. Trump for the return of the toddler, Agence France-Presse reported. Receiving the little girl at the presidential palace in Caracas, Maduro thanked Mr. Trump for a \"profoundly humane act.\"",

      "Nissan is slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, as the Japanese automaker reported a loss Tuesday for the fiscal year that just ended amid slipping vehicle sales in China and other nations, and towering restructuring costs.",
      "Nissan said it will reduce the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under what it called its recovery plan to carry out \"decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.\" It did not say which plants were being closed but confirmed the closures will include factories in Japan.",
      "\"We have a mountain to climb,\" CEO Ivan Espinosa told reporters, stressing the task will not be easy, requiring discipline and team work. \"Starting today, we build the future for Nissan.\"",
      "The job cuts to be done by March 2028 include the 9,000 head count reduction announced last year. Nissan also previously announced the scrapping of plans to build a battery plant in Japan.",
      "Espinosa, who took the helm earlier this year, said the latest plans followed a careful review of operations, to align production with demand, including coming up with market and product strategies. Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",
      "\"As new management, we are taking a prudent approach to reassess our targets and actively seek every possible opportunity to implement and ensure a robust recovery,\" Espinosa said.",
      "Nissan aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.",
      "But Nissan Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin acknowledged the automaker faces serious challenges. Nissan did not give a profit projection for the fiscal year through March 2026, citing uncertainties.",
      "Tariffs weighing on automakers",
      "The Trump administration in March\u00a0imposed a 25% tariff on the roughly 8 million vehicles assembled abroad that the U.S. imports annually.",
      "General Motors earlier this month said it's\u00a0lowering its profit expectations for the year as it braces for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. The revised forecast came after Mr. Trump signed executive orders in April\u00a0to relax some tariffs on automobiles and car parts.",
      "Ford Motors also pointed to higher U.S. tariffs in announcing last week that\u00a0it is raising prices\u00a0on three models produced in Mexico. And Toyota last week said Mr. Trump's tariffs would cost the company $1.3 billion in just two months. The carmaker stopped short of making predictions on future tariff hits on business, with Toyota CEO Koji Sato saying that any future impact would be \"very difficult to forecast.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, beginning a three-nation visit to the region and the first international trip of his second administration. Saudi Arabia is the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump, and he was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",

      "\"Last time I went to Saudi Arabia, they put up $450 million,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in March, while pledging to make the visit again should there be another investment in American companies. In a call shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The Trump administration also held talks with Russia in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier this year on how to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the visit is also expected to focus on business. Mr. Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami in February sponsored by Saudi government entities, as the Trump Organization has sought to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia, and the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "Mr. Trump has also attracted some high-profile business leaders to Riyadh for a U.S.-Saudi investment summit on Tuesday. The speakers will include Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has touted the trip's diplomatic opportunities.",
      "\"The president looks forward to embarking on his historic return to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week, where he will focus on strengthening ties between our nations,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday. \"Eight years ago, President Trump's first trip was to this same region of the world, where he introduced his bold peace-through-strength foreign policy strategy.\"",
      "The Trump administration brokered a diplomatic breakthrough during his first term that normalized relations between Israel and a number of Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to accompany the president in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the State Department said, where they will \"look to strengthen ties between the United States and Gulf partners.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will also join the president on the Middle East trip, a Pentagon spokesperson said. And Mr. Trump is expected to visit with U.S. military personnel at the U.S. airbase in Qatar, Leavitt said.",

      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",

      "Boeing has had production issues delivering the next generation of the Air Force One fleet on time. (Getty Images)",
      "\"The clause was specifically inserted because of concerns by the Founders at the Constitutional Convention over corruption of our foreign diplomats, especially by the French government.\u00a0It is questionable whether the emoluments clause even applies to the president since he is not named and the Constitution usually names the president when a provision applies to him.\u00a0That is why the impeachment clause specifically provides that it applies to the \u2018president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States.\u2019 If \u2018officers\u2019 of the U.S. included the president, there would be no need for him to be separately listed,\" von Spakovsky explained.",

Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",

      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",

The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy.

It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space.

      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts.

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports on how a MacReaper campaign infected 2,800-plus websites, spreading malware to Apple Macs.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Domains and sites compromised in the MacReaper campaign",
      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",
      "Macs aren't as secure as Apple wants you to believe",
      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from MacReaper attack",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "Hackers have become increasingly sophisticated in targeting bank accounts, sometimes stealing money without the account holder realizing it right away. This raises an unsettling concern among many: could someone actually drain your bank account while making it appear as though your balance remains untouched?",
      "As Bruce from Phoenix asks, \"Is it true that hackers can wipe out your bank account but make it look like the money is still there?\"",
      "The short answer is yes, though it\u2019s rare and requires a high level of skill. Still, even the possibility is alarming, especially when you consider how easily people can fall victim to common tactics hackers use to gain access to accounts in the first place.",

      "How do hackers access your bank account?",
      "There\u2019s a long list of methods cybercriminals use to get into people\u2019s financial accounts, and most of them don\u2019t involve \"hacking\" in the Hollywood sense. Instead, they rely on tricking you into handing over sensitive information. Here are some of the most common techniques.",
      "Fake banking apps and mobile trojans: Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank\u2019s official app, but they\u2019re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced are\u00a0mobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen. If you type in your credentials, the trojan grabs them and sends them off to the attacker.",
      "Phishing scams: Scammers\u00a0send emails or texts that appear to be from your bank, asking you to verify a transaction or log in to resolve an issue. These messages often include links to websites that look identical to your bank\u2019s site but are actually fakes. The giveaway is often a small detail, like a misspelled URL. For example, \"captial0ne.com\" instead of \"capitalone.com.\"",
      "Keyloggers:\u00a0Keyloggers are a type of malware that silently records everything you type. If one gets onto your device, it can capture your banking username, password and anything else you type, all without you knowing.",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks:\u00a0These attacks happen when hackers intercept the data being transmitted between you and your bank\u2019s website. This is especially risky if you\u2019re on\u00a0public Wi-Fi. You may think you're logging in securely, but a hacker could be watching everything or even redirecting you to a fake version of your bank's site.",
      "SIM swapping:\u00a0SIM swapping is where a scammer contacts your phone provider, pretends to be you and asks to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If successful, they receive your text messages, including any verification codes sent by your bank. This gives them access to your account, even if two-factor authentication is turned on.",

By targeting the display layer of your banking app or web interface. If malware is installed on your device, it can manipulate what shows up on the screen. That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it\u2019s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened.",

      "The good news? You don\u2019t need to be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself. Just following these key steps can dramatically reduce your risk.",
      "1) Use official apps only: Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it\u2019s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts.",
      "2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based\u00a02FA to block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password.",
      "3) Get text or app alerts: Hackers can manipulate your account\u2019s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords: Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "8) Use a personal data removal service: Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GOT A BANK TRANSFER ALERT TEXT? IT MIGHT BE A SCAM. HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Hackers don\u2019t need to break into your bank\u2019s system; they just need to trick you. Whether it\u2019s phishing, malware or SIM swaps, the goal is always the same: get access to your login and verification codes. Fortunately, you can make it much harder for them by using secure habits and staying alert. Your money belongs with you, not in the hands of a scammer.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",

      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship is a real, practical answer to the challenges we face in logistics and the environment today. By blending tried-and-true lighter-than-air technology with advanced, fuel-efficient propulsion, AT\u00b2 Aerospace is showing us a whole new way to think about sustainable transport. It is encouraging to see that when it comes to moving cargo responsibly, the sky really is no longer the limit.",

      "A person texting on their phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "However, not all carriers support this, and some may block the feature altogether to prevent spam or limit abuse. Even among those that do support it, there can be differences between how SMS (text-only) and MMS (media messages) are handled.",
      "Below are examples of the special email addresses (called gateways) that let you send text messages via email:",
      "AT&T",
      "SMS: number@txt.att.netMMS: number@mms.att.net",
      "SMS: number@txt.att.net",

      "SMS & MMS: number@tmomail.net",
      "If you rely on this feature, such as sending yourself reminders from your email or receiving system alerts to your phone, it is important to check whether your carrier supports it. Be aware that not all carriers clearly document this capability, especially smaller providers like Spectrum Mobile or Xfinity Mobile, which may restrict or not support it at all.",

      "Safety steps for mobile messaging",
      "To enhance your mobile messaging security, follow these best practices:",
      "1. Avoid clicking on unknown links or messages and install strong antivirus software: Be cautious with links or attachments from unknown sources because they can lead to\u00a0phishing or malware attacks. Also, install strong antivirus software on your device to protect against malware and viruses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):\u00a0Use MFA to add an extra layer of security for your messaging apps and accounts. This can include methods like authentication apps, physical security keys, or SMS codes, which help prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised. By activating MFA, you significantly reduce the risk of your accounts being hacked, providing an essential safeguard against cyber threats.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Keep your device and apps updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system and apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "4. Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps: Consider using apps with end-to-end encryption for secure communication. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can read the messages, keeping them safe from hackers or third-party interception. Popular options include Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage, which prioritize privacy and protect sensitive conversations from unauthorized access.",
      "5. Be mindful of public Wi-Fi and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):\u00a0Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive communications, as it can be insecure and expose your data to potential eavesdropping or hacking. Consider using a VPN for secure browsing on public networks because it encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, providing a safer experience even on unsecured networks. By using a VPN, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with public Wi-Fi and protect your personal data from unauthorized access. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "6. Delete sensitive messages:\u00a0Regularly delete sensitive messages to minimize data exposure. This practice helps protect your privacy by ensuring that confidential information isn't stored indefinitely on your device or in the cloud, where it could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties. Additionally, consider using messaging apps that offer features like automatic message deletion or self-destructing messages to further enhance your privacy",

      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A French startup named Robeaut\u00e9 has just raised about $29 million to develop a truly groundbreaking neurosurgical microrobot.",
      "Imagine a device no bigger than a grain of rice that can carefully navigate the complex and delicate pathways of the brain.",
      "This little robot could change the way doctors treat brain tumors and other neurological conditions, making surgeries safer and more precise than ever before.",

      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",
      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "Looking ahead: Trials and future plans",
      "So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "Why this technology matters",
      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain.

      "An attorney for Robinson, whose real name is William Robinson Jr., said he welcomes the investigation and feels \"confident that a determination will be made that Mr. Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create.\"",
      "\"The record will ultimately demonstrate that this is nothing more than a manufactured lawsuit intended to tarnish the good names of Smokey and Frances Robinson for no other reason than unadulterated avarice,\" said the lawyer, Christopher Frost, referring to Robinson's wife.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Frances Robinson of perpetuating a hostile work environment.",
      "The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is seeking $50 million in damages and identifies the plaintiffs as former housekeepers. One of the women alleges that she was sexually assaulted at least 23 times between 2014 and 2020, according to the suit.",
      "Another plaintiff said she was assaulted at least 20 times during the 12 years she worked for Robinson, a pioneering Motown artist who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",
      "Harris said the women, identified as Jane Does 1-4 in the suit, were low-wage workers who did not previously come forward because they feared reprisal and public embarrassment.",
      "Three of the women also said they were concerned about possible adverse effects on their immigration status, according to the suit."

    "story": [
      "Outside of President Donald Trump, no White House official has accumulated more influence in this administration than Stephen Miller, the 39-year-old anti-immigration crusader whose brain and bare-knuckled tactics have been deployed to drive the agenda for the commander in chief.",
      "Not Vice President JD Vance. Not chief of staff Susie Wiles. Not anyone else.",
      "It is Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, who loaded up scores of executive orders for Trump to sign in his first months back in office\u00a0 \u2014 on topics ranging from the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to dismantling diversity programs in the federal government and withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cStephen is the president\u2019s id,\u201d said one former Trump adviser who knows Miller well. \u201cHe has been for a while. It\u2019s just now he has the leverage and power to fully effectuate it.\u201d",
      "Democrats have long pointed to Miller, in similar if darker fashion, as the engineer of Trump\u2019s most audacious plans and tactics. Though he receded a bit from the spotlight during billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s ascendance in the first months of Trump\u2019s second term, Miller is re-emerging as a target for the political opposition.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller is responsible for all the bad things happening in the United States,\u201d Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said, adding that Miller was the force behind \u201csome of the ugliest policies\u201d in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "This profile is drawn from interviews and text exchanges with more than a dozen White House officials, lawmakers and Trump-world figures familiar with Miller and his work.",
      "Even some of those who praised Miller in interviews were reluctant to be identified because they weren\u2019t sure what might anger him \u2014 or how the hard-liner might seek payback. As a staffer on the Hill, he threatened to turn activists on fellow Republican aides when their bosses did not line up behind his positions, one senior GOP aide on Capitol Hill recalled.",
      "\u201cUh oh,\u201d one senior White House official texted when notified that NBC News was working on a story about Miller.",
      "But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who met Miller when they were both working to sink a bipartisan 2013 immigration overhaul in Congress, had no such reticence.",
      "\u201cI think he was an effective [Senate] staffer, and I think he is an exponentially more effective senior staffer in the White House,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "\u201cI think he has been the chief architect in the White House of the president\u2019s extraordinarily successful efforts securing the border,\u201d said Cruz, who described Miller as a friend with whom he speaks \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "Wearing a second hat as Trump\u2019s White House homeland security adviser, Miller has pushed novel policies to restrict citizenship and even legal residency in the U.S.",
      "One of the first executive orders he prepared for Trump, signed on Inauguration Day, would end the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee that people born in the United States are automatically citizens. Last week, he said that the White House is considering suspending the right of habeas corpus \u2014\u00a0a constitutional protection against unlawful detention \u2014 as the administration seeks to continue its deportation program. Like the birthright citizenship order and many other Trump actions, parts of the deportation effort have been impeded on constitutional grounds by federal judges.",
      "Miller\u2019s voice is the one arguing vociferously \u2014 and without evidence \u2014 that \u201cMarxist judges\u201d are executing a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d by identifying limits on the president\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump built much of his current political success by standing with the American people on immigration, and doing what others have been unwilling or unable to do: close the border,\u201d said one top Trump adviser. \u201cThere has been no bigger advocate of that in the history of the country than Stephen Miller. That, at its core, is why the president trusts him so much, and relies on him to a degree that is matched by very few.\u201d",
      "That trust is a big reason Miller\u2019s reach extends far beyond the immigration policies for which he became famous during Trump\u2019s first term, which included separating migrant families as a deterrent to illegal immigration.",
      "Miller\u2019s deputy title doesn\u2019t do justice to the amount of influence he has in the White House. In a Signal exchange reported on by The Atlantic in March, Miller silenced Vice President JD Vance\u2019s questioning of a pending battery of military strikes in Yemen by asserting that Trump already had given the \u201cgreen light.\u201d He has gained so much authority over such a broad spectrum of policies that Trump told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that it would be a \u201cdowngrade\u201d if he appointed Miller as national security adviser, usually a high-profile and highly coveted role in any West Wing.",
      "\u201cStephen is much higher on the totem pole than that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump \u201cmeant it\u201d when he said that about Miller, the senior Trump adviser affirmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is any policy area where his guidance is not sought. The president might not always go with exactly what he wants, but his input is always listened to.\u201d",
      "Miller\u2019s influence stems from sharing Trump\u2019s vision for the country, his fierce public and private defense of Trump\u2019s positions, and his supply of a steady stream of policies to implement the president\u2019s agenda, according to people who work with him now or have done so in the past. The former Trump adviser said that Miller, who came of age in politics during the tea party era, is more tethered to the values of the Make America Great Again movement than many of his colleagues in the White House.",
      "\u201cStephen has broadened his lane, but it still centers on the forgotten man, the working man, Trump\u2019s America,\u201d the former Trump adviser said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s coming from in all of this.\u201d",
      "In that way he is like Trump: an elite who embraces populism. Miller\u00a0 does so with even more zeal than his patron, which may be surprising given his background. He grew up in the cozy Los Angeles suburbs, graduating from Santa Monica High School, where prior alumni included the Brat Pack movie stars Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Robert Downey Jr. Miller, however, never had Trump-level money, and his family lost its home when he was in school, forcing them to move to a lower-rent area.",
      "Then he went to Duke, one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious private colleges, where he honed his conservatism before becoming a congressional aide.",
      "A staffer for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Miller was an early enlistee on Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign in 2016 and took over speech-writing duties and an immigration portfolio in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "When Trump lost the 2020 election, Miller, who echoed Trump\u2019s lies about a rigged vote, turned his attention to founding America First Legal, a nonprofit that presaged the early days of Trump\u2019s second presidency by filing dozens upon dozens of lawsuits in cases involving immigration, education, affirmative action and transgender rights.",
      "Miller is not a lawyer, but his vision is what has driven much of Trump\u2019s legal strategy in the second term.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller works around the clock to implement President Trump\u2019s America First policy agenda, and he is doing a phenomenal job,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cThe president fully trusts Stephen and for good reason \u2014 he delivers.\u201d",
      "Miller\u2019s plan coming into this term, said one person who has worked with him for years and remains an ally, was to overwhelm the court system in an effort to secure more powers for Trump.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller has been sharpening his teeth for this moment,\u201d the ally said, adding an assertion that he is the \u201cmost consequential\u201d White House official since Vice President Dick Cheney.",
      "Likewise, a lawyer who is close to the White House described Miller as a singular figure in the Trump orbit who methodically prepared to win more unilateral power for the presidency, and by extension himself, even at the cost of losing some battles.",
      "\u201cThe courts aren\u2019t going to strike down all that they\u2019re doing, and, at the end of the day, they\u2019ll end up accomplishing more by flooding the zone,\u201d the lawyer said of the mindset driving Miller and his policy team, which includes Gene Hamilton and May Mailman \u2014 who, unlike Miller, have law degrees.",
      "\u201cThe content of many of these executive orders has his fingerprints,\u201d the lawyer close to the White House added of Miller. \u201cYou want to get something done in this White House, if you can get to Stephen Miller, there\u2019s probably no more effective way to get something done.\u201d",
      "His symbiotic relationship with Trump requires \u2014 or at least encourages \u2014 a willingness to parrot the philosophically peripatetic president, even when that means reversing course on policy at a moment\u2019s notice or misleading the public, according to people who have worked with him.",
      "Miller is \u201ccomfortable with misinformation to advance his cause,\u201d said one senior first-term Trump White House official who praised his patience and intellect.",
      "Critics are more blunt, labeling his anti-immigrant rhetoric as \u201cpropaganda.\u201d While Trump has blocked refugees from most of the world from entering the U.S., his administration recently admitted several dozen white South Africans. The reasoning: what Trump administration officials call a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers in the majority-Black nation, which codified discrimination during its apartheid regime. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a genocide.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,\u201d Miller said last week. \u201cThis is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty, and historically, it has been used that way.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s little question that Miller is the de facto immigration czar in Trump\u2019s Washington \u2014 the man the president relies on to turn ideas into action.",
      "A week before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reflected on Miller\u2019s primacy in an interview with NBC News. Grassley\u2019s committee is in charge of writing immigration policies for what Trump calls the \u201cbig beautiful\u201d bill designed to implement his legislative agenda in a single fell swoop.",
      "But Grassley could not say what would be in that legislation.",
      "\u201cThe best place to get this answer is from Stephen Miller,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "It was a remarkable degree of deference from a 44-year veteran of the Senate, who is third in line to the presidency, to an unelected Trump staffer who elicited more eye rolls than legislative achievements when he worked on Capitol Hill as a communications aide about a decade ago.",
      "Not every Republican senator is waiting for marching orders from Miller. Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, replied tersely when asked if he speaks to Miller often: \u201cNope.\u201d",
      "In early April, Miller was the featured speaker at a meeting of Senate Republican chiefs of staff, where he pressed aides to encourage their bosses to provide a more fulsome defense of Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 including tariffs and the programmatic and personnel cuts developed by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, according to a person who was present.",
      "Miller\u2019s wife, Katie Miller, is a longtime Musk confidante who worked on his DOGE team, and the couple has formed a close working relationship with the wealthiest man in the world. The Miller ally said Katie Miller has become a powerful force inside the administration, and that the Millers, along with Sergio Gor, the White House personnel chief, are the only \u201cuntouchable\u201d members of Trump\u2019s White House team.",
      "\u201cStephen has always preached loyalty to the president,\u201d said a second White House official. \u201cHe is ruthless with bureaucrats being seen as disloyal to the president and his agenda.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to find an arm of the White House, or the wider administration, that doesn\u2019t have one of Miller\u2019s hands attached \u2014 or an argument that isn\u2019t phrased in his trademark bombast.",
      "On the first day of May, Miller strode into the White House briefing room to offer an aggressive defense of Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014\u00a0the \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform he primarily drafted and executed \u2014 amid public concern that its tariff plank was tanking the U.S. economy.",
      "Breaking from generations of evidence, economic theory and conservative orthodoxy suggesting that American consumers want cheaper goods, Miller lectured the media on his view \u2014 already articulated by Trump \u2014 that families would be happy to pay more for toys made in the U.S. than those made in China. Despite his zealously anti-regulation position at most times, Miller even appeared to embrace the value of safety standards that drive domestic prices higher.",
      "\u201cIf you have a choice between a doll from China that might have, say, lead paint in it that is not as well constructed as a doll made in America that has a higher environmental and regulatory standard and that is made to a higher degree of quality, and those two products are both on Amazon, [then] yes, you probably would be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,\u201d Miller said.",
      "As he spoke, the French cuffs of his perfectly starched white dress shirt poked out from beneath a dark suit accented with a silky pocket square.",
      "Miller\u2019s arguments, echoing Trump\u2019s almost to the word, quietly vanished Monday as quickly as they had materialized, when the White House announced that the U.S. and China had agreed to back down from their punishing reciprocal tariffs amid the threat of shortages, price increases and long-term damage to both economies. The heat had finally become too much for Trump to bear.",
      "No matter how much power Miller wields, he seems well aware that it is derivative \u2014 and that it can be taken away as quickly as a tariff if he stands even a step away from his boss.",
      "\u201cThe president knows he won\u2019t leak,\u201d the senior Trump adviser said. \u201cHe knows he will be an unquestioned fighter for his agenda, and that brand of loyalty is what matters most in a lot of ways.\u201d"

      "Florida has become the second state to officially ban fluoride in public water.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 700, also known as the\u00a0Florida Farm Bill, into law Thursday. The bill doesn\u2019t specifically mention the word \u201cfluoride,\u201d but it effectively bans the mineral by preventing \u201cthe use of certain additives in a water system.\u201d It will go into effect July 1.",
      "\"You\u2019ve had this debate, and really Florida\u2019s led on this, too, partially because our Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, has really led the charge by going to counties and saying forcing fluoride into your water is actually not good,\" DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. \"Yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that\u2019s fine. But forcing it in the water supply is basically forced medication on people. They don\u2019t have a choice.\"",
      "DeSantis said the fluoridation of water violates \u201cinformed consent.\u201d He also said the mineral has been proven to negatively affect pregnant women and children, inviting medical professionals, including Ladapo, to talk about the mineral\u2019s side effects.",
      "A\u00a0study published in 2019\u00a0suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy, but its research was\u00a0far from conclusive.",
      "The governor argued that there are other ways residents can get access to fluoride if they\u2019d like and stressed that the mineral shouldn\u2019t be mandated by governments.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing preventing you in your house from adding fluoride to your water,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "DeSantis signed the bill in Miami, where Mayor Daniella Levine Cava vetoed a fluoride ban that the county commission passed last month. NBC South Florida reported the commission voted 8-4 in favor of overriding Cava\u2019s veto last week.",
      "Cava, a Democrat, has openly criticized the plan to ban fluoride in the state.",
      "\u201cI am deeply disappointed by the Florida Legislature\u2019s decision to pursue a statewide ban on water fluoridation, a decision that disregards the overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors, and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health,\u201d she said in a statement issued last month.",
      "Florida is following in the footsteps of Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March\u00a0prohibiting any person or government entity from\u00a0adding the mineral to the state\u2019s water systems, making it the first state to do so. It went into effect last Wednesday.",
      "The anti-fluoridation movement has been gaining popularity, seemingly fueled by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said drinking fluoridated water has no \u201csystemic advantage.\u201d",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics, the\u00a0American Dental Association\u00a0and the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0support adding fluoride to water, saying that drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities. All studies have shown that it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Legislation to ban fluoride has circulated in Kentucky,\u00a0Massachusetts,\u00a0Nebraska,\u00a0Wisconsin and North Carolina. Hawaii, which has never mandated water fluoridation,\u00a0has the \u201chighest prevalence of tooth decay in the United States\u201d among its children, with only 11% of its residents served by fluoridated community water systems, according to\u00a0a 2015 study\u00a0of third graders throughout the state by the state health department.",
      "CORRECTION (May 15, 2025, 3:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Utah's fluoride ban went into effect. It was last Wednesday, May 7, not next Wednesday."

      "Stallworth was a 27-year-old airman stationed at Hill Air Force Base, north of Salt Lake City, and he was never identified as a potential suspect so never was interviewed during the investigation into Gallegos' death, the police department said. Their relationship, if any, remains unclear to this day, it said.",
      "Stallworth was identified as a suspect after police sent DNA samples to Othram Labs\u00a0in Texas in 2023. Othram is a company that specializes in cold cases and uses genealogy, police said.

      "The view from inside",
      "When cross-examination started, Ventura spoke with trepidation and caution. But she seemed to gain confidence as the day went on, answering questions calmly and politely. She occasionally expressed confusion about certain queries. Estevao initially appeared to struggle to find a rhythm, repeatedly starting and stopping, but she settled into a steady groove after lunch.",
      "Diddy\u2019s three sons as well as his mother, Janice Combs, sat in the gallery today. The rapper\u2019s mom has been in the federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan every day this week, listening to extraordinarily graphic testimony about her son\u2019s alleged history of violent abuse and sexual proclivities.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian looks determined to keep the trial moving at a brisk clip. He promised jurors they would be done with their service before July 4 \u2014 and he appears mindful of the fact that Ventura is potentially days away from giving birth. He sternly reminded the defense it was given a day and a half to question her, and scolded Diddy\u2019s lead attorney after he pushed back.",
      "\u201cIn what universe did you not understand that this was important,\u201d Subramanian asked the attorney, Marc Agnifilo.",
      "In other news: The prosecutors and defense lawyers seemed to have a cordial rapport during pretrial hearings. But it has quickly evaporated this week. The tension in the courtroom ramps up dramatically whenever the jury isn\u2019t seated. This morning, for example, the lawyers on opposing sides got into a heated dispute over which text messages the defense can introduce as evidence.",
      "Diddy, meanwhile, took notes on a pad while those arguments unfolded.",
      "Analysis: Consent or coercion?",
      "Ventura\u2019s testimony on cross-examination will read well for the prosecution on the transcript. It might not have sounded as good to the jury. That\u2019s because a transcript doesn\u2019t capture the cadence, inflection and mood of the answers. For jurors, who are listening to her testimony live and watching her body language, Ventura\u2019s testimony could go either way.",
      "On the one hand, she is answering the questions \u2014 and she is mostly saying what the prosecution needs for its case. But on the other hand, some questions have no good answers. When the defense confronts her with text messages that suggest she was a willing participant in the \u201cfreak off\u201d lifestyle, there really is no perfect response for Ventura.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible jurors will see her as a victim who was unable to extricate herself from Diddy\u2019s clutches. They may see her as someone coerced into the lifestyle. But it\u2019s also possible that one or more jurors might conclude that Ventura repeatedly chose to be with Diddy and join in \u201cfreak offs,\u201d sometimes with enthusiastic messages to him. It takes only one juror to deadlock.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "Tomorrow: Ventura will return to the witness stand for more cross-examination by Diddy\u2019s team. The judge and prosecutors have made clear they\u2019d like questioning to wrap by the end of the day."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As House Republicans scramble to corral the votes to pass a massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda, their Senate counterparts are making clear the emerging package won\u2019t fly as written when it reaches them.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., was categorical that the product coming out of various House committees cannot pass the Senate as it currently stands.",
      "\u201cNo. We\u2019ll make changes,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking with the House and there\u2019s a lot of things we agree on. \u2026 But there\u2019ll be changes in a number of areas.\u201d",
      "It wouldn\u2019t surprise House members to learn that their Senate colleagues want to put their own fingerprints on the final multitrillion-dollar package. But Republican senators have already begun to identify a variety of provisions in the House measure that they\u2019re targeting for revisions \u2014 from Medicaid concerns to clean energy funding to spectrum policy and overall red ink.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., came out against the emerging House legislation this week, saying it will explode the U.S. budget deficit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any scenario where it\u2019s going to be deficit-neutral. That\u2019s my problem,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cBy my calculation, this is going to increase the deficit by $4 trillion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe amount that they\u2019re looking to reduce spending is about 1.3%. It\u2019s a rounding error. It\u2019s completely inadequate,\u201d Johnson said as he insists federal spending be at least lowered to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Republicans have 53 senators, meaning they can only lose three votes before the bill collapses int he chamber, as they have no hope of winning Democrats. They\u2019ve already lost Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who wants steeper cuts. And Democrats are dialing up the heat on GOP attempts to cut energy funding in the Inflation Reduction Act, highlighting the 2022 law's economic and national security benefits.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., last month with three other Republicans warning that \u201ctermination\u201d of certain clean energy tax credits enacted in 2022 \u201cwould create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House committee tasked with writing the tax provisions of the package is seeking to repeal significant subsidies for electric vehicles and aims to phase out other clean energy tax incentives that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "On Wednesday, Murkowski told NBC News she, John Curtis, R-Utah, Thom Tillis, R-NC, and Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, \u201cmade clear that we needed to take a cautious approach to the energy tax credits and make sure that we don\u2019t lose out on some of the good investments that we built.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also been warning against Medicaid cuts as the House bill seeks to impose work requirements and provider funding limits that have been panned by critics.",
      "\u201cI will not support Medicaid benefit cuts,\u201d Hawley told NBC News on Tuesday, adding that he has \u201cconcerns with pieces\u201d of the House bill because of what it would mean to rural hospitals in his state.",
      "He later wrote on X: \u201cI don\u2019t want to see rural hospitals close their doors because funding got cut. I also don\u2019t like the idea of a hidden tax on the working poor. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a NO on this House bill in its current form.\u201d",
      "Hawley\u2019s concerns are shared by Murkowski as well as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who voted against the budget framework last month, citing concerns about Medicaid cuts harming her state.",
      "Another issue Senate Republicans want to revise are provisions that House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said would renew \u201cthe Federal Communications Commission\u2019s spectrum auction authority and provide resources to modernize federal information-technology systems,\u201d and save $88 billion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to actually look at the language on the spectrum issue. It clearly has to be corrected,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.",
      "Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said the policy needs \u201cto go much further, much further\u201d and she \u201ccannot accept it as it came out of the\u201d House Energy and Commerce Committee.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is hoping to steer the measure through the House Budget Committee on Friday and pass the entire bill through the chamber \u2014 with some changes \u2014 before Memorial Day.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who faces re-election next year in a competitive state, said the Senate will need to review the House language on Medicaid cuts, clean energy money and other policies before making a decision.",
      "Tillis also said the Senate isn\u2019t enthused by the draft House bill\u2019s policy to raise the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $30,000, up from $10,000. Unlike in the House, there are no GOP senators in the high-tax blue states where \u201cSALT\u201d is a big issue.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s an area where we\u2019re going to need some consideration,\u201d Tillis said."

      "'The president's id': How Stephen Miller and his bare-knuckled tactics are driving Trump's agenda",
      "Outside of President Donald Trump, no White House official has accumulated more influence in this administration than Stephen Miller, the 39-year-old anti-immigration crusader whose brain and bare-knuckled tactics have been deployed to drive the agenda for the commander in chief.",
      "Not Vice President JD Vance. Not chief of staff Susie Wiles. Not anyone else.",
      "It is Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, who loaded up scores of executive orders for Trump to sign in his first months back in office\u00a0\u2014 on topics ranging from the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to dismantling diversity programs in the federal government and withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cStephen is the president\u2019s id,\u201d said one former Trump adviser who knows Miller well. \u201cHe has been for a while. It\u2019s just now he has the leverage and power to fully effectuate it.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s in a title: Miller\u2019s deputy title doesn\u2019t do justice to the amount of influence he has in the White House.",
      "In a Signal exchange reported on by The Atlantic in March, Miller silenced Vice President JD Vance\u2019s questioning of a pending battery of military strikes in Yemen by asserting that Trump already had given the \u201cgreen light.\u201d He has gained so much authority over such a broad spectrum of policies that Trump told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that it would be a \u201cdowngrade\u201d if he appointed Miller as national security adviser, usually a high-profile and highly coveted role in any West Wing.",
      "\u201cStephen is much higher on the totem pole than that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump \u201cmeant it\u201d when he said that about Miller, the senior Trump adviser affirmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is any policy area where his guidance is not sought. The president might not always go with exactly what he wants, but his input is always listened to.\u201d",
      "\u2018Untouchable\u2019: Miller\u2019s wife, Katie Miller, is a longtime Elon Musk confidante who worked on his DOGE team, and the couple has formed a close working relationship with the wealthiest man in the world.",
      "One Miller ally said Katie Miller has become a powerful force inside the administration, and that the Millers, along with Sergio Gor, the White House personnel chief, are the only \u201cuntouchable\u201d members of Trump\u2019s White House team.",
      "\u2018Uh oh\u2019: Even some of those who praised Miller in interviews were reluctant to be identified because they weren\u2019t sure what might anger him \u2014 or how the hard-liner might seek payback. As a staffer on Capitol Hill, he threatened to turn activists on fellow Republican aides when their bosses did not line up behind his positions, one senior GOP aide recalled.",
      "When notified that we were working on a story about Miller, one senior White House official texted: \u201cUh oh.\u201d",

      "Johnson tries to strike balance between blue-state Republicans and conservative hard-liners",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is exploring ways to placate two rival factions that have emerged as the biggest roadblocks in the narrow House majority to a massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "There\u2019s the Republicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states who want a higher cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT. The current version of the legislation raises the cap to $30,000, from $10,000, for individual filers. But that doesn\u2019t go high enough for the pro-SALT Republicans.",
      "Then there are the conservative hard-liners who have pushed for steeper cuts to Medicaid. They want the work requirements for the health care program to kick in much earlier than the 2029 date the bill calls for.",
      "After meeting with SALT Caucus Republicans and hard-right Freedom Caucus members, Johnson suggested there could be some wiggle room on those fronts.",
      "\u201cI am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to adjust the dial, so to speak, so that we can come to an agreement that will meet the criteria that everybody has and that we can move this thing forward,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cIf you do more on SALT, you have to find more savings. So these are the dials, the metaphorical dials, that I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to do this in a deficit neutral way \u2014 that was the commitment that we made all along.\u201d",
      "Asked if Republicans will speed up the Medicaid work requirements to extract larger savings in a revised plan, Johnson replied: \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is the compromise that could work,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of the conservative hard-liners.",
      "Trouble brewing? But Johnson could have a problem getting through the next step in the process: the House Budget Committee, which is scheduled to cobble together the bills that various committees have passed into one package on Friday. At least three conservatives on the panel, Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., have cited issues with the legislation as it stands. And Republicans can only afford one defection there.",

      "Iconic soul singer Smokey Robinson, who was accused of sexually assaulting four former housekeepers for years in a lawsuit filed earlier this month, is under criminal investigation, a law enforcement official said Thursday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the investigation is in its early stages and declined further comment.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the investigation, first reported by TMZ, is linked to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Our clients intend to fully cooperate with LASD\u2019s ongoing investigation in the pursuit of seeking justice for themselves and others that may have been similarly assaulted by him,\" John Harris and Herbert Hayden said in a statement.",
      "An attorney for Robinson, whose real name is William Robinson Jr., said he welcomes the investigation and feels \"confident that a determination will be made that Mr. Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create.\"",
      "\"The record will ultimately demonstrate that this is nothing more than a manufactured lawsuit intended to tarnish the good names of Smokey and Frances Robinson for no other reason than unadulterated avarice,\" said the lawyer, Christopher Frost, referring to Robinson's wife.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Frances Robinson of perpetuating a hostile work environment.",
      "The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is seeking $50 million in damages and identifies the plaintiffs as former housekeepers. One of the women alleges that she was sexually assaulted at least 23 times between 2014 and 2020, according to the suit.",
      "Another plaintiff said she was assaulted at least 20 times during the 12 years she worked for Robinson, a pioneering Motown artist who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",
      "Harris said the women, identified as Jane Does 1-4 in the suit, were low-wage workers who did not previously come forward because they feared reprisal and public embarrassment.",
      "Three of the women also said they were concerned about possible adverse effects on their immigration status, according to the suit."

      "The recalls come after American faucet brand Moen noticed cheap foreign-made faucets for sale on Amazon, the company told NBC News. Moen paid the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, a plumbing certification agency with American National Standards Institute accreditation, to test 19 of the top-selling inexpensive foreign-made products.",
      "The IAPMO lab found 17 of the 19 faucets failed to meet national drinking water standards \u2014 11 for lead and 15 for organic compounds including carcinogens and a chemical used to treat lice and scabies.",
      "\u201cConsumers that use these products and drink this water with these higher levels of contaminants are going to be at higher risk for getting things like cancer,\u201d said Tom Palkon, chief technical services officer at IAPMO.",

      "\u201cThe American consumer is going to know that they need to stop using all of these faucets that they may have bought on these websites,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cYou need to ban people who can\u2019t meet our safety standards.\u201d",

      "The faucets might seem like a bargain at around $30 \u2014\u00a0and can look very similar to faucets from top American brands that can go for hundreds of dollars. Moen said that makes it tough for consumers to tell a high-quality fixture apart from a knockoff.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen examples where they\u2019re literally copying every aspect of our product, from markings to trademark names and logos that we put on our product,\u201d said Aaron Bores, Moen\u2019s executive vice president of product development.",

      "Holding up two valves at the hearing, Bores said: \u201cWhen searching for this one Moen valve on e-commerce, we found one real Moen SKU. That same search resulted in 41 counterfeit SKUs. Consumers have no chance of discerning a real product from a fake, nor do the most experienced plumbers.\u201d",
      "Amazon has not responded to NBC\u2019s request for comment. The companies selling the recalled faucets couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The CPSC said in its recalls that consumers should immediately stop using the faucets\u00a0\u2014 adding that until they\u2019re replaced, people should only drink from them after running the water for 15 seconds.",
      "Palkon from IAPMO said consumers can look for certification marks on faucets and verify them with the certification agency online or by calling the agency. He said consumers can also use water filters to remove some heavy metals and chemicals."

This week, the crossing that straddles the Rhine river as it meanders across the borders with nearby France and Germany was lined with flags bearing the Eurovision Song Contest slogan, \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d",
      "Basel, and Europe at large, are anything but united.",
      "Police and the the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are preparing themselves for a potential repeat of last year\u2019s iteration of Eurovision, the song competition that launched the careers of ABBA and 1988 winner Celine Dion. The 2024 contest was overshadowed by politics perhaps more than in any previous year, with fierce protests over the participation of Israel amid its government\u2019s intensifying war on Gaza.",
      "It\u2019s purely by chance that this year\u2019s contest, usually an outrageous jamboree of inscrutable lyrics and scantily clad backing dancers, is being held in a country with a long-standing policy of neutrality. Each year\u2019s venue is dictated by which country won the previous year.",
      "The EBU, which organizes the contest, says the event is nonpolitical, but given that it brings together dozens of countries \u2014 this year, 37 nations will take part \u2014 the divisions and flashpoints present on the world stage inevitably creep in among the pyrotechnic reveling.",
      "The political divide over Israel\u2019s participation in Basel has already tested the EBU\u2019s impartiality.",
      "Israel shattered a fragile two-month ceasefire earlier this year, as its military intensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Strip and enforces a total blockade of food, medicine and goods from entering the enclave, where more than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "The war began following the Hamas-led terror attacks on several sites in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 people. One of those sites was the Nova music festival, where around 360 people were killed.",
      "The singer representing Israel, which first took part in the contest in 1973, is Yuval Raphael \u2014 one of the survivors of that attack.",

She told the U.N., \u201cthe physical injuries I sustained are healing, but the mental scars will stay with me forever.\u201d",
      "The EBU bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "While the lyrics of this year\u2019s song, \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d don\u2019t make reference to any events in particular, Galia Press-Barnathan, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the message is nevertheless clear."

    "story": [
      "A baby born with a\u00a0rare and dangerous genetic disease\u00a0is growing and thriving after getting an experimental\u00a0gene editing treatment\u00a0made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that\u00a0won its inventors the Nobel Prize\u00a0in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\u201d it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2014 like a little wave or rolling over \u2014 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy\u00a0approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014\u00a0funded in part by the National Institutes of Health\u00a0\u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won\u2019t have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn\u2019t involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\u201d for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d"

Just over a month ago, Saxena had been notified that her visa and status in the country had been revoked.",
      "Saxena\u2019s attorney, Jim Leach, told NBC News that her sole infraction was for a failure-to-yield to an emergency vehicle from four years ago, which he described as \u201cthe lowest possible traffic offense.\u201d",
      "Saxena, who sued the Trump administration, was granted a temporary restraining order until the end of this week, allowing her to collect her degrees. And on Thursday morning, she was granted a preliminary injunction that keeps the government from attempting to detain or deport her.",
      "\u201cThe rule of law saved an innocent person from unlawful action by this administration,\u201d Leach said. \u201cDr. Saxena is exactly the kind of person we should want in this country.\u201d",

      "She was later told by a school official that her record had been terminated in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), which maintains information about nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors.",
      "While Saxena received the traffic infraction in 2021, she paid a fine and, upon applying for her most recent visa, disclosed the information to the government, the court documents said.",
      "\u201cThe government reissued her visa and then comes back three and a half years later and says, \u2018Oh, wait a minute. Get out of the country now,\u2019\u201d Leach said. \u201cIt just makes no sense.\u201d",
      "Because of her loss of status, her school at the time also notified her that she would not be able to receive her Ph.D. degree, which she had been working toward since 2020, as scheduled this year, court documents said.",
      "While the Trump administration said last month that it would be restoring international students\u2019 legal statuses until Immigration and Customs Enforcement crafts a new framework for terminations, Leach said Saxena\u2019s status was not impacted as ICE had to abide by the judge\u2019s orders in her case. However the judge granted the temporary restraining order last month, extending the timeframe so she could complete her studies.",
      "Saxena\u2019s graduation coincided with a separate, highly controversial graduation that weekend. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem received an honorary degree at Dakota State University. Protesters gathered at the school to criticize the treatment of international students and the administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.",

      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute previously mentioned that the database doesn\u2019t always have the final dispositions of cases.

    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to strike a delicate balance between blue-state Republicans and conservative hardliners on a sprawling bill for Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is exploring ways to placate two rival factions\u00a0who have emerged as the biggest roadblocks in the House to a\u00a0massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda: blue-state Republicans who want larger tax breaks for their constituents and conservatives who want Medicaid cuts to kick in sooner.",
      "Johnson suggested to reporters Wednesday that provisions for a higher state and local tax (SALT) deduction and to enforce new Medicaid work requirements sooner could be incorporated into the final package as he stares down a self-imposed Memorial Day weekend deadline for passage.",
      "\u201cI am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to adjust the dial, so to speak, so that we can come to an agreement that will meet the criteria that everybody has and that we can move this thing forward,\u201d Johnson said after meeting with pro-SALT Republicans and hard-right Freedom Caucus members.",
      "\"If you do more on SALT, you have to find more savings. So these are the dials, the metaphorical dials, that I\u2019m talking about,\" he said. \"We are trying to do this in a deficit neutral way \u2014 that was the commitment that we made all along.\"",
      "Asked if Republicans will speed up the Medicaid work requirements to extract larger savings in a revised plan, Johnson replied: \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told NBC News that the work requirements for Medicaid will kick in earlier than 2029, when the current bill would trigger them. Asked what the new timeframe would be, Scalise said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have an exact date, but it\u2019ll be sooner than what\u2019s in the current bill.\u201d",
      "That approach has potential to win over conservative hard-liners who want the new Medicaid rules to take effect earlier.",
      "\u201cThat is the compromise that could work,\u201d Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said.",
      "Republicans say they've made steady progress on the bill this week even as some key issues remain unresolved. Eleven House committees have now passed their portions of the legislation, sending them to the Budget Committee to cobble together into one package as early as Friday.",
      "But multiple Republicans on that panel have voiced skepticism for the emerging package, including Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., citing issues with the level of spending cuts and uncertainty on matters like SALT. Republicans can lose just one vote on the Budget Committee for the bill to advance.",
      "\u201cAt this point I\u2019m still a 'no' on the budget proceeding,\u201d Norman said Thursday afternoon after a GOP meeting, adding that he plans to meet with Johnson later. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a spending problem. We\u2019ve got a deficit problem.\u201d",
      "Roy said he\u2019s also a \u201cno,\u201d insisting that the Medicaid work requirements take effect immediately.",
      "In the full House, Johnson can afford just three Republican defections on the final bill, so even small factions like the SALT Caucus hold enormous power in the negotiations. Those members also tend to hail from critical battleground districts that will determine the balance of power in the next election.",
      "But it\u2019s far from clear that approach will work, as the specter of more immediate Medicaid cuts could alienate other politically vulnerable Republicans who are already catching heat for the bill\u2019s existing spending reductions and limits to the health care program.",
      "The two sides on Thursday still remained far apart and Johnson said he expected talks to extend into the weekend, even as he has stuck by a Memorial Day deadline to pass the massive tax cuts, energy and border package through the lower chamber. Tensions have also been boiling over inside the House GOP over the SALT issue all week, with cracks emerging even among the pro-SALT members about whether to take an offer to lift the $10,000 cap to $30,000.",
      "But moderates and conservatives emerged from Johnson\u2019s office Thursday saying that their two-hour meeting was positive and that no red lines were drawn by either side.",
      "\u201cWe are still working through the numbers,\u201d said moderate Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., a SALT Caucus member who says he will vote against the bill unless the deduction cap is hiked higher than the current $30,000 proposal. \u201cThe bottom line is, [a higher SALT cap] is going to be in the bill, and we\u2019re going to work through it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe core issue is that if the SALT cap goes up, then there\u2019s more money you have to go find,\u201d added conservative Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Freedom Caucus member who is running for governor.",
      "But such a trade could create a Rubik\u2019s cube problem for House Republicans. While deeper Medicaid cuts and a larger SALT deduction may be a palatable trade to a few dozen hard-liners and a handful of blue-state members, it may leave a bitter taste for others \u2014 most notably politically vulnerable members. While Republicans opted against some of the most dramatic potential cuts to the health care program, their current proposal would still cause 8.6 million people to lose their insurance coverage, according to an early estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "It is unclear Johnson has the votes to pass the existing Medicaid cuts, which include new work requirements and a host of stricter eligibility checks and paperwork, which critics say will create onerous burdens for rightful recipients.",
      "Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., who has the highest share of Medicaid recipients of any GOP-held district, said he\u2019s undecided on the existing Medicaid provisions.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the details yet, so we\u2019re still getting through it and seeing the actual impact,\u201d he said.",
      "Freshman Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who narrowly flipped a Democratic-held district last year, also said he isn\u2019t taking a position on the Medicaid provisions just yet.",
      "Another vulnerable Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he would be \u201camenable\u201d to shifting up the date when the Medicaid provisions kick in.",
      "Valadao, Bresnahan and Bacon all represent the few dozen GOP-held swing districts that Democrats are targeting in their quest to capture the House next year. And they see Medicaid as their most potent issue, arguing that the existing bill will impose suffering among the vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThe self-described moderates spent months falsely promising the American people they would draw a red line on cuts to Medicaid. Now they want to trigger these cuts before the midterms? Good riddance,\" said Justin Chermol, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, some conservatives have expressed deep reluctance about spending more money to provide SALT relief to people in high-tax blue states. Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, a fiscal hawk who attended Thursday\u2019s meeting, said walking into the speaker\u2019s office that she thinks \u201cit\u2019s gonna be tough\u201d to raise the SALT cap.",
      "But Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who was not in the meetings, said \u201cif we do land the plane, it\u2019ll be because\u201d of Trump.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has been largely responsible for all the deals landed in the House,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Florida has become the second state to officially ban fluoride in public water.",
    "story": [
      "Florida has become the second state to officially ban fluoride in public water.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 700, also known as the\u00a0Florida Farm Bill, into law Thursday. The bill doesn\u2019t specifically mention the word \u201cfluoride,\u201d but it effectively bans the mineral by preventing \u201cthe use of certain additives in a water system.\u201d It will go into effect July 1.",
      "\"You\u2019ve had this debate, and really Florida\u2019s led on this, too, partially because our Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, has really led the charge by going to counties and saying forcing fluoride into your water is actually not good,\" DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. \"Yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that\u2019s fine. But forcing it in the water supply is basically forced medication on people. They don\u2019t have a choice.\"",
      "DeSantis said the fluoridation of water violates \u201cinformed consent.\u201d He also said the mineral has been proven to negatively affect pregnant women and children, inviting medical professionals, including Ladapo, to talk about the mineral\u2019s side effects.",
      "A\u00a0study published in 2019\u00a0suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy, but its research was\u00a0far from conclusive.",
      "The governor argued that there are other ways residents can get access to fluoride if they\u2019d like and stressed that the mineral shouldn\u2019t be mandated by governments.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing preventing you in your house from adding fluoride to your water,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "DeSantis signed the bill in Miami, where Mayor Daniella Levine Cava vetoed a fluoride ban that the county commission passed last month. NBC South Florida reported the commission voted 8-4 in favor of overriding Cava\u2019s veto last week.",
      "Cava, a Democrat, has openly criticized the plan to ban fluoride in the state.",
      "\u201cI am deeply disappointed by the Florida Legislature\u2019s decision to pursue a statewide ban on water fluoridation, a decision that disregards the overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors, and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health,\u201d she said in a statement issued last month.",
      "Florida is following in the footsteps of Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March\u00a0prohibiting any person or government entity from\u00a0adding the mineral to the state\u2019s water systems, making it the first state to do so. It went into effect last Wednesday.",
      "The anti-fluoridation movement has been gaining popularity, seemingly fueled by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said drinking fluoridated water has no \u201csystemic advantage.\u201d",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics, the\u00a0American Dental Association\u00a0and the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0support adding fluoride to water, saying that drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities. All studies have shown that it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Legislation to ban fluoride has circulated in Kentucky,\u00a0Massachusetts,\u00a0Nebraska,\u00a0Wisconsin and North Carolina. Hawaii, which has never mandated water fluoridation,\u00a0has the \u201chighest prevalence of tooth decay in the United States\u201d among its children, with only 11% of its residents served by fluoridated community water systems, according to\u00a0a 2015 study\u00a0of third graders throughout the state by the state health department.",
      "CORRECTION (May 15, 2025, 3:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Utah's fluoride ban went into effect. It was last Wednesday, May 7, not next Wednesday."

She also addressed backlash over the crowdfunding page \u2014 which has now raised more than $500,000 \u2014 the family established to help with legal and moving costs.",

      "The 60-year-old actor spoke about her early hesitation during a two-part appearance in the \"Are You a Charlotte?\" podcast, hosted by longtime \"Sex and the City\" co-star Kristin Davis. Speaking to Davis, Parker explained why she \"panicked\" at the idea of \"committing\" to the series, even after she shot the show's pilot, which first aired in 1998.",
      "As Parker explained it, the experience of filming the show's first episode was \"lovely,\" but she \"forgot all about it\" until one day, she was walking down a street in New York City when she ran into a well-known producer who complimented her on the show.",
      "\"Then I went on with my day, and when the show was picked up, I panicked,\" she recalled. \"I was like, I can\u2019t be on a TV show. I don\u2019t think I'm suited for that life.\"",
      "Prior to \"Sex and the City,\" Parker had made a name for herself, having starred in \"Square Pegs,\" \"A Year in the Life,\" and \"Equal Justice,\" the latter of which was the only one to make it two seasons. Parker explained that the brief length of each series afforded her a chance to \"bounce around\" and appear in other films and work with experienced actors and directors.",
      "\"Then I moved on and I would do a play or I'd do some readings and then I'd do a part in a movie,\" she explained. \"I really thought, like that is the goal, like the journeyman is the goal.\"",
      "\"The idea of a television series meant that I couldn\u2019t do all those things ... and that I would get in the same car every day, and it just kind of felt like somebody was, you know, putting their hand over my mouth or something,\" she explained, adding that she eventually called up her agent.",
      "\"I talked to my agents and I said, 'You know, hey, can you get me out of this?'\" she recalled before noting that, eventually, she learned that because HBO was still relatively new and an \"unknown species\" to many, she had the benefit of flexibility.",
      "Eventually, she was encouraged to try it out for just a year.",
      "\u201cAnd I never looked back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never not happy to be there. There was no place I would rather have been than on our set.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A day after Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, alleged that Blake Lively \u201cdemanded\u201d Taylor Swift release a statement supporting her, Judge Lewis J. Liman has had the accusations stricken from the case.",
      "On Thursday, May 15, Judge Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial between the two \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars set for\u00a0March 9, 2026, in New York \u2014 described Freedman's letter as \"improper\" and said it \"must be stricken,\" in a court ruling obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "\"It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,\" Judge Liman wrote.",
      "He continued, \"The sole purpose of the Letter is to 'promote public scandal' by advancing inflammatory accusations, on information and belief, against Lively and her counsel. It transparently invites a press uproar by suggesting that Lively and her counsel attempted to 'extort' a well-known celebrity.\"",
      "At the end of Judge Liman's statement, he added, \"Counsel is advised that future misuse of the Court\u2019s docket may be met with sanctions.\"",
      "Lively's spokesperson sent a statement to TODAY.com reacting to Judge Liman granting the request of the Lively's legal team to remove Freedman's allegations from the record.",
      "\u201cIt took the court less than 24 hours to see through Mr. Freedman\u2019s irrelevant, improper and inflammatory accusations, strike them, remove them from the court and warn Mr. Freedman that further misconduct may be met with sanctions,\u201d Lively's spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Freedman for a comment.",
      "Liman's decision regarding Freedman's accusations is the latest development involving\u00a0the legal battle between the two former co-stars.\u00a0Following Swift\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0addressing the pop star reportedly being subpoenaed\u00a0in Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal back-and-forth, Freedman filed\u00a0a letter\u00a0with\u00a0Judge Liman on May 14, in which the attorney wrote that the purpose of the subpoena was to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",
      "Freedman further described the alleged demands as \u201cinappropriate and apparently extortionate threats\u201d and said a representative for Swift responded to them in \u201cat least one written communication\u201d sent to Gottlieb.",
      "\u201cIt is those communications that the Wayfarer Parties seek to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyer continued.",
      "TODAY.com obtained a statement from Gottlieb regarding Freedman\u2019s letter to the judge, in which he called the accusations \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively's lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Swift\u2019s rep for a comment, as well.",
      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",
      "According to NBC News, one alleged text from Lively read, \u201cIf you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you\u2019ll appreciate that I\u2019m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

      "In a May 15 interview with Time magazine, Reid revealed she is bisexual, despite many fans assuming she was straight as she is married to a man.",
      "\u201cIt has been hard at times to see people dismiss me as a straight woman, but I also didn\u2019t tell them the whole story,\u201d she said.",
      "Reid admitted that assumptions about her sexuality are nothing new for her. In fact, they began when she was a teenager when she dressed differently than the social norm.",
      "\"I got hit pretty quickly with, 'Why can\u2019t you dress more like a girl? Why don\u2019t you do your nails? Why do you talk that way? Can\u2019t you be a little bit quieter?'\" she told the outlet. \"I started to get people who would say, \u2018Oh, I get why you dress like a boy\u2014you\u2019re gay.'\"",
      "But Reid didn't feel like she identified with being labeled as gay, as she was attracted to both sexes \u2014 her first love was a man and then, in her early 20s, she fell in love with a woman. With both loves, however, people doubted if it was the right course for her.",
      "\"This was the late '90s, so nobody was talking about bisexuality. And if they were, it was to make fun of people,\" Reid told the outlet. \"The messages about bisexuality were you just want attention, or it was a stop on the way to gayville.",
      "\"I found that very painful, because I was being told that I didn\u2019t know myself, but I did,\" she added.",
      "Reid hasn\u2019t been shy in expressing her sexuality through her writing, penning characters who fall on different ends of the spectrum of sexuality.",
      "In \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d the main romance centers around a heterosexual love triangle, while \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d details a love story between two women. Meanwhile, \u201cMalibu Rising,\" which was Read with Jenna's pick for June 2021, showcases mainly heterosexual relationships, but one character experiences a queer awakening.",
      "Her new book, \"Atmosphere,\" out June 3, allowed Reid to explore more of her attraction to women. The novel features a love story between one woman in outer space and one on the ground.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like time for me to write a very high-stakes, dramatic love story,\" the author told Time.",
      "While she may not have always been open with the public about the specifics of her sexuality, she told Time that she was always honest with those closest to her. Her husband, screenwriter Alex Jenkins Reid, even showed her an idea that describes someone's sexuality as a house with many rooms.",
      "\"My attraction to women is a room in the house that is my identity \u2014 Alex understood this book was about me spending time in that room,\u201d Reid said. \"He was so excited for me, like, \u2018What a great way for you to express this side of you.\u2019 And he helped me get the book to be as romantic and beautiful as it could be.\"",
      "Reid also understands that because she's married to a man, she gets \"straight-passing\" privileges that others don't receive.",
      "\"How do I talk about who I really am with full deference to the life experiences of other people?\" she told Time. \"Basically, where I came down is I can talk about who I am, and then people can think about that whatever they want.\""

      "In September 2024, Paul sparked rumors that she and Mortensen had split after she posted a video of her dancing on TikTok with the caption, \u201cNot me morphing into 2022 me.\u201d For those who know the lore of the show, 2022 was the year her marriage to Tate Paul ended.",
      "She also said in another TikTok, posted Sept. 23, that the show was too \u201ctriggering\u201d to watch. The same weekend, Paul posted an Instagram story about a \u201cnew chapter\u201d beginning.",

      "\u201cI was the night girl that you came over to at night and you were asking her on date dates and telling her cute things. I feel like a piece of f------ trash,\u201d Paul later said.",

      "In Episode 2 of Season 2, Paul\u2019s family invited Mortensen over for a meal.

      "\u201cCo-parenting is great, but it\u2019s also the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst pain a parent can experience, it\u2019s very torturous. For me, experiencing that already with my other two, this one has been excruciating and been really hard. To make that decision for myself, because I knew the pain that was coming with it, made it a lot harder to let go of us being together.\u201d",
      "While addressing the possibility of a reunion with Mortensen, Paul offered the following thoughts.",
      "\u201cI think he has that hope still to this day. So, I think if any or both of us are holding on to even one percent chance, then I don\u2019t want to say \u2018never say never,\u2019\u201d she said."

      "Chronicling the lives of June (Ming-Na Wen), Waverly (Tamlyn Tomita), Rose (Rosalind Chao) and Lena (Lauren Tom), \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d spotlights the characters often-complicated relationships with their mothers (played by Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, Lisa Lu and France Nuyen) and the various challenges they each face.",

      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",

      "Ming-Na Wen: Generation after generation gets to see this film. But also, I think they still react the same as they did 30 years ago. A lot of the young Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans, they still feel the value of the immigrant story and the familial story between the mothers and the daughters. They all have such amazing stories of how it impacted them, and I think that\u2019s a real testament of Amy Tan\u2019s storytelling, that it transcends time.",
      "Lauren Tom: I think one of the beautiful contributions that this film has made to just people at large is that it provides a portal to start conversations. So, when you can see something objectively apart from you on the screen, you might be brave enough to have that conversation with your mom.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: Complementing what Ming said, people will react the same way in seeing this collection of stories by Amy Tan. But also, they do react with it differently because they grow older, they have children, and they\u2019re watching it with their children, when they were children at the first time they were watching it. So, there is that constant shift, but it\u2019s also the connectivity between the generations. It\u2019s a portal. It\u2019s an impetus to ask your mother, \u2018What happened to you? What were you like when you were younger?\u2019",
      "Lauren Tom: One of the joys for me was watching my kids watch the movie for the first time, and they were laughing all the way through it, even though it has much sadness. So, I had forgotten how funny it is, too. I think that\u2019s also why it touched so many people.",
      "Rosalind Chao: And not just Asian Americans.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: Anybody who has a mom.",
      "Lauren Tom: It was thrilling to be able to just be a part of (that). Even the crew, everyone involved, there was so much diversity. And that was 30 years ago, so, even more impressive.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: In our lifetimes, previous to that, there was never a film, there were episodic television shows.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: I remember because I was the only New Yorker hired for the main parts. I hadn't come out to LA, I met them in San Francisco, and as almost a lone wolf at the time, where you\u2019re the one token Asian in an audition room with many, many Caucasian actresses, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that was the time back then. But to come into a room with the incredible Asian female cast. I almost felt like I was in a foreign land.",
      "Rosalind Chao: I remember sitting outside. I had a newborn, and I was breastfeeding outside the room where they were waiting to do our first table read. I heard them all talking about their individual experiences, and when they met each other in audition rooms, and I remember feeding him and just started crying. The three of them, that comradery, hearing that in the next room, it was just so moving.",
      "Rosalind Chao: Yes, literally. We\u2019re like sisters. We each have our quirks, we don\u2019t talk about it \u2026",
      "Ming-Na Wen: (Interrupting) Yes, we do!",
      "Lauren Tom: (Laughing) We call each other out all the time.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: But in the most loving way. It\u2019s quite extraordinary to have four actresses, that are around the same age and all vying for the same roles \u2026 to never feel like we\u2019re in competition with each other. It\u2019s like, if you\u2019re supposed to get the role, you get the role and we\u2019re always so supportive and so happy for each other.",
      "All: No, no, no, no \u2026",
      "Ming-Na Wen: (But) the fact that it was not even nominated for a screenplay ...",
      "(The others interject)",
      "Ming-Na Wen: (It's been) 30 years, it needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed.",
      "Rosalind Chao: Not only were we not nominated, but we were asked to present at the Oscars and one of us was at the phone and heard, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve just been un-asked.\u201d",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: We want to acknowledge our own mothers in our own lives, but also Kieu Chinh, Lisa Lu, France Nuyen, and the fantastic Tsai Chin.",
      "We became better women because of those women, because knowing their legacy, their history through Hollywood and their careers and what they still continue to pass down along. The three of us were lucky to join Ming when she received her Hollywood Star of Fame and we will be all there for Lisa Lu\u2019s reception of receiving the star.",
      "So, yes. Becoming better women, becoming better actors, becoming better community people, becoming better moms and, ultimately, becoming better daughters, because we\u2019re lucky that we have our mother-actors still with us. Some of us have our mothers still with us and we just treasure them with their quirks and personalities. So, it\u2019s a test of time and it\u2019s a testament to the lesson that we still learn from them.",
      "Rosalind Chao: After that experience, I kind of buried myself because I felt like a wayward mom. But I did think more was going to open.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: I think it opened, I think it did help. That\u2019s why I call it my \u201cGreen Card\u201d (to Hollywood) because it was like, \u201cOh, we know you,\u201d because a lot of casting people saw the film. So, whether it was a success or not in the box office, it didn\u2019t matter. It really elevated our name.",
      "Lauren Tom: Being part of this film means that you have some class and you\u2019re a good actor, because our reviews were so wonderful, that it was an automatic, \u201cYou\u2019re alright.\u201d",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: I think it did open the doors for the nine of us. But in terms of more Asian American stories, it did not happen, because if we\u2019re waiting 20 years until \u201cCrazy, Rich Asians,\u201d and they\u2019re pinpointing it to the touchstone of \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d nope, it goes farther than that. It goes to \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d \u201cThe World of Suzie Wong.\u201d",
      "We need to keep reminding our community, as well as the nation and the world of movies, that our stories have been box office hits, they\u2019re classics and they\u2019re timeless. They should be stolen and told all the way along because they\u2019re universal. It\u2019s about mothers, it\u2019s about families. It\u2019s about falling in love. It\u2019s about celebrity.",
      "Rosalind Chao: And being American.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: It\u2019s about being seen. When I read Amy Tan\u2019s book, that was the first time I was struck at feeling like someone sees me. That I was not living this life, the adventure, these experiences alone.",
      "Rosalind Chao: Like Kieu Chinh says to you in the movie, \u201cI see you,\u201d that\u2019s exactly how we felt when we read Amy Tan\u2019s book and that we belong.",
      "Rosalind Chao: It\u2019s so exciting. The first time seeing Bowen, I was a fangirl, because you could see right away he had that extra thing. And Ronny Chieng \u2026 we are breaking. That\u2019s my dream for us, that we break into the tapestry that we\u2019re not considered \u2018exotic\u2019 anymore. That we\u2019re just part of America.",
      "Lauren Tom: I\u2019ve gotten to this certain age now where everyone feels like my kid. I\u2019m proud of them. Sometimes I don\u2019t even know them and I\u2019m like, \u201cI am so proud of you.\u201d"

      "\u201cI think Judy was ahead of her time,\u201d actor Michael Cooper, who plays Justin, says. \u201cEspecially with \u2018Forever\u2019 as a book \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant. And then Mara\u2019s adaptation is just so current. It\u2019s such a beautiful interpretation.\u201d",

They didn\u2019t expect to find each other\u2014but it was a pleasant surprise.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn high school, everything feels so big,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI remember thinking one little thing could make the world crumble. That\u2019s how their relationship feels \u2014 high-stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, and you don\u2019t have many years to look back on, everything feels more intense. It feels like the end of the world,\u201d Simone says.",
      "But as in Blume\u2019s novel, that promise is tested.",
      "In \u201cForever\u2019s\u201d final chapters, Katherine realizes she\u2019s grown apart from Michael after her grandfather dies. It\u2019s a quiet heartbreak \u2014 no scandal, no villain, Just two people choosing to be honest.",
      "The Netflix version similarly grounds Keisha\u2019s evolution in loss. When an old sex tape filmed without her full consent resurfaces, it fractures her sense of safety and identity. Justin is a student with ADHD who is passionate about music but struggles in school and with direction in life.",
      "Simone says Keisha\u2019s ability to love Justin was shaped by her need for self-love. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to love him fully until she checked in with herself,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wanted to love him so badly that she had to do something for herself first.\u201d",
      "For Justin, the journey is equally internal.",
      "\u201cThere was this line Mara wrote: \u2018He had one foot in confidence and the other in insecurity,\u2019\u201d Cooper says. \u201cKeisha gave him the space to be his authentic self. He could be vulnerable with her. And although sometimes I\u2019d be like, \u2018Bro, what are you saying?\u2019 He just let it out. She allowed him that space.\u201d",
      "In the show\u2019s final episodes, Keisha earns a scholarship to Howard University. Justin, meanwhile, is torn between following his parents\u2019 preferred path \u2014 attending Northwestern \u2014 or taking a gap year to pursue music. When Keisha encourages him to choose himself, it\u2019s no longer a breakup rooted in pain, but a conscious step toward individual growth.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us,\u201d she tells him, \u201cthen fight for Justin.\u201d",
      "That sentiment echoes Blume\u2019s original message. Her characters don\u2019t reunite in the end. There\u2019s no grand romantic gesture \u2014 just a phone call from a friend, a reminder that life goes on.",
      "Blume didn\u2019t write \u201cForever \u201cto make readers feel better about breakups. She wrote it to validate their feelings \u2014 that first love is real, even if it isn\u2019t permanent. Akil\u2019s adaptation honors that truth while layering in modern realities like race, class, and digital trauma.",
      "\u201cWhat I hope audiences take away,\u201d said Cooper, \u201cis that love can teach you who you are \u2014 but it can\u2019t always carry you into who you\u2019re becoming.\u201d",
      "In the end, the title \u201cForever\u201d isn\u2019t a promise. It\u2019s a question. And the answer, as both Blume and Netflix remind us, is that growing up is the point.",

    "story": [
      "Going into the \"9-1-1\" Season Eight finale, the 118 is more fractured than ever in the wake of the death of Capt. Bobby Nash.",
      "After Bobby (played by Peter Krause) died alone locked in a lab in a shocking ending to Episode 15, his team of firefighters found out about the tragedy separately.",
      "Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) broke the news to Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson's wife, while Hen (Aisha Hinds) sobbed alone after being quarantined. Evan \"Buck\" Buckley (Oliver Stark) collapsed onto the ground and screamed, as Howard \"Chimney\" Han (Kenneth Choi) called his wife in tears. Finally, as revealed in the most recent episode, \"Don't Drink the Water,\" Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman), who is living in El Paso, received a call in the middle of the night and had to stifle his sobs as to not wake up son Christopher (Gavin McHugh).",
      "The last two episodes before the May 15 finale followed the characters through the funeral and their return to work. Each person has seemingly spiraled in a different way.",
      "Chimney was the recipient of Bobby's ultimate sacrifice. In the lab, they both were infected with a dangerous virus, but Bobby hid his symptoms. The only antidote was used to save Chimney's life, and Bobby succumbed to the virus.",
      "Chimney then struggled with how to accept Bobby\u2019s actions. Eddie \u2014 who returned from El Paso for the funeral \u2014\u00a0questioned if things could have been different if he had been with his team. And Buck tried to provide support to everyone to honor Bobby's last words to him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be OK, Buck. Remember that. They\u2019re going to need you. I love you, kid.\u201d",
      "Oliver Stark tells TODAY.com that Buck is interpreting Bobby's last words as a task he's been charged with. But as the penultimate episode revealed, Buck has felt the team slipping away.",
      "\"I think probably because of what Bobby left him with, he\u2019s trying to take more control than is necessary, which is not working for him,\" Stark says.",
      "The disconnect between characters came to a head in Episode 17. Buck and Eddie, staying under the same roof for Bobby's funeral, have a fight that started over who was supposed to get the groceries and ended with Eddie accusing Buck of making his new job opportunity with an El Paso fire department all about himself.",
      "\"You'd make it all about you. The trials and tribulations of Evan Buckley, a tragedy in 97 acts,\" Eddie said. \"You've been spiraling since the funeral. And no one knows how to talk to you about it.\"",
      "\"Sorry, I'm sad that Bobby's dead,\" Buck responded.",
      "\"You\u2019re not the only one who lost him,\" Eddie said. \"We all lost him.\"",
      "Below, Stark unpacks what he believes Bobby's final words to Buck mean and what's at the heart of the most recent fight between Buck and Eddie.",
      "He\u2019s tried to be \u2014 the way I\u2019ve always interpreted it is, he\u2019s tried to step into the Bobby role. Not by any means captain, but in the sense of, they\u2019re going to need somebody to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get through this.\u201d And a scene that sticks out in my mind is from the previous episode (Episode 16, \u201cThe Last Alarm\u201d), when Chimney is on the rooftop. I was very much like, I didn\u2019t want to come be emotional with Chimney. It was \u2014 we almost have work to do by going to the service and the funeral, and it\u2019s like, \u201cCome on. Pull yourself together.\u201d And this is out of duty more than anything.",
      "I think Buck has been trying to hold himself together because he feels like he\u2019s been charged with this task by Bobby. And that\u2019s why it was really nice to me this past episode, the confessional scene, to let that facade go.",
      "I think it\u2019s the idea that everybody\u2019s experience is their own. We\u2019re all looking at things from our own point of view. So Buck doesn\u2019t necessarily know that Eddie has gone to Hen\u2019s house to have these conversations. All Buck knows is something feels different. He says we\u2019re not eating together, which is obviously something that Bobby instituted into the 118. So it doesn\u2019t have to be true for everybody. It just has to be true for Buck, that\u2019s the way he is seeing things.",
      "And I think probably because of what Bobby left him with, he\u2019s trying to take more control than is necessary, which is not working for him. And because of that, the juxtaposition between what he thinks it should be and what it actually is is so far apart that it must make things feel worse.",
      "Just, everybody\u2019s hurt. And everybody deals with grief differently. And I don\u2019t know if Buck necessarily lashed out in the scene, as much as was a bit already defeated, maybe. He\u2019s not getting back in Eddie's face until the very end. He\u2019s not actually being loud or complaining about Eddie going.",
      "To me, it just kind of feels like a piece is missing from Buck, and it\u2019s left him a bit empty. And I think Eddie, obviously, having not been there for the death, has all this emotion and needs somewhere to put it.",
      "Actually, no, I don\u2019t think it was fair in that particular instance. But I think it\u2019s fair in a sense that \u2014\u00a0so when we were shooting the scene, I was actually given the note of, \u201cI don\u2019t think you are making it about you. I think you need to be a bit more bratty or whatever.\u201d",
      "And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d I think for Eddie to say that, it\u2019s actually just a culmination of past things that Buck has done that in the past. And so even though Buck is not actively making it about himself in this moment, it\u2019s almost PTSD of Buck having done that so many times, so that\u2019s what conjures up for Eddie. So it\u2019s fair in the sense of, as I say, it\u2019s just what he\u2019s used to experiencing from Buck.",
      "But I think because everybody\u2019s just going through such a tough time, like emotions are just all over the place, and something that doesn\u2019t go the way you expected it to can trigger something completely different. And it\u2019s just all up in the air, and everything is clashing and butting heads.",
      "I\u2019ll argue with Ryan all day, that's no problem. (Laughs). No, I mean, the whole cast, we have such a truly great relationship. Everybody is really close, and there\u2019s so much trust that it\u2019s easy to go to places with each other, because you feel safe as a performer and as a friend.",
      "Some people love to go to work, and everybody\u2019s process is different. Some people want to feel that in real life, right? Like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to talk to you between takes. We\u2019re going to let this really build.\u201d But I think what has been the theme for our cast is, no, let\u2019s have as much fun as we can, so that then when we go into these darker scenes, we can really go at each other, and we still know that afterwards, we\u2019re friends. And it\u2019s a safe environment.",
      "I think in the early seasons, it was clear that Buck was always trying to, whether it be prove himself, or there was just an uncertainty in everything he did, an insecurity \u2014 and sometimes you combat insecurity by going too far in the opposite direction. And I think Buck had a case of that, and so when the question of the bisexuality was brought to me, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, that could be the thing.\u201d And I think post that, there\u2019s been a more \u2014\u00a0for the most part, obviously, it\u2019s not black and white \u2014\u00a0but there\u2019s been a more settled and grounded Buck. And then something can come in like Eddie leaving, and that can unsettle him again. But he\u2019s from a more grounded place.",
      "So yeah, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s looking for himself in quite the same way. But, I mean, I assume Buck is my age, so early to mid-30s, and still figuring some stuff out about his life and what he wants to do and be. There will always be similar questions, but I think they\u2019re coming from a calmer, more settled place.",
      "The finale of \u201c9-1-1\u201d Season Eight will air on ABC May 15 at 8 p.m. ET and stream the next day on Hulu."

    "summary": "Oliver Stark of \"9-1-1\" unpacks Buck's grief over Bobby's (Peter Krause) death and his hopes for Buck's future on the ABC series.",
    "story": [
      "The back half of \"9-1-1\" Season Eight has been Evan \"Buck\" Buckley's nightmare come to life.",
      "The Los Angeles firefighter started out fresh off a breakup. Meanwhile, his best friend, Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman), moved from California to Texas. His sister, Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt), is then kidnapped (again), and his beloved captain and father figure, Bobby Nash (Peter Krause), is killed by a gruesome virus after being trapped in a lab.",
      "Fans of the long-running procedural may remember that after Buck, played by Oliver Stark, was struck by lightning in Season Six, an entire episode was dedicated to his coma dream. The episode, titled \"In Another Life,\" questioned what would happen if Buck never became a firefighter. The result? Eddie lost custody of son Christopher (Gavin McHugh), Maddie remained married to the abusive husband responsible for her first kidnapping and Bobby was long dead.",
      "Asked if Season Eight is essentially Buck's nightmare, Stark answers literally.",
      "\"I would say it's a strong coincidence. I don't think that's an intentional choice, but it's funny how things work out sometimes,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"If it is, I have yet to find that out.\"",
      "Bobby's death sent shock waves through the \"9-1-1\" fan base. In a major change from the show's typical formula, the 118 didn't all make it out alive from an emergency.",
      "Over the course of Episodes 14 and 15, the 118 responded to a fire at a lab that studied viruses. An explosion rocked the facility with the team inside, triggering an emergency quarantine door, locking Bobby, Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds), Howard \"Chimney\"\u00a0Han (Kenneth Choi) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) inside \u2014 and Buck out.",
      "Buck teamed up with Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) \u2014\u00a0also Bobby's wife \u2014 to try and free them as an aerosolized version of a modified, dangerous virus infected Chimney and Bobby.",
      "Buck and Athena tracked down the one antidote for the virus and administered it to Chimney as he actively experienced organ failure. After the rest of the 118 finally left the lab, Bobby locked himself in again and removed his mask, revealing the virus had already set in.",
      "Below, Stark unpacks the impact of Bobby's death, how his character is handling his grief after the funeral and where \"9-1-1\" goes from here.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Well, it sounds like I was making a good guess. I think the thread of a family falling apart. You know, you take out one key element, and you just watch as the whole thing starts to kind of disintegrate, I suppose. And that\u2019s obviously what we saw with Bobby\u2019s passing, and how the 118 lost its patriarchal figure, and the struggles and the fallout of that and the crumbling world without its foundation and structure.",
      "So the first time I watched it \u2014 on occasion, I'll watch an episode before it airs, but it tends to be before the (visual effects) and before the final sound mix. So this was an earlier version, and I didn\u2019t think it would make me emotional, because I knew it was coming. I\u2019m inside the machine as it were, and the first time \u2014 when it gets to the part, and he says, \"Love you, kid.\" I didn\u2019t just like cry, it burst out of me, and I was so surprised by that.",
      "But I think it\u2019s obviously a personal connection to him, as well, and that particular line has big meaning for us. And yeah, I really, like sobbed when it happened. But that was pre-VFX, so he didn\u2019t look as sickly. A lot of the blood is added in post(production).",
      "And so then when I did watch it live on television, I said, \"Oh yeah, he really looks like he\u2019s about to die.\" And it just took it to a whole nother level. So very emotional, very moving.",
      "Often the moments of advice that he gives me are not when I\u2019ve asked for something specific. It\u2019s just in watching how he behaves, watching how he conducts himself, how he treats people, how he approaches the job.",
      "One of the things he did say to me that always sticks out in my mind is way back, Season One. The beginning of the show really gives Buck a lot to do. And then I remember we came across the first episode where I didn\u2019t have so much to do, and I went to him, and I said, \"Do you think I messed up? Like they were giving me all this story. Now there\u2019s this episode, and I don\u2019t really say much in it.\" And I was 26 at the time, and he said to me, \"I get it. You\u2019re 26. You always want to be thrown the ball.\" He said, \"I\u2019m 52. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit on the bench.\" And I always remember that.",
      "I would never be so bold as to assume myself unkillable. The most honest answer to that is, I probably would have assumed everybody else was unkillable, but in my own head, I\u2019d be like, \"But me, they could take me out at any moment.\"",
      "But that has been, obviously, the culture of the show, is to say we can put them into these situations, and we\u2019re going to make you think, and then at the last second, no, they\u2019re going to make it. And (showrunner) Tim (Minear) decided it was time to take a big swing and a big creative choice. And I say to him, credit to him. I think it\u2019s important to not just exist in the gray. And he wanted to move in a really strong direction. And I understand the idea that at some point you\u2019ve got to do that because of fear of the audience going, \"Well, I don\u2019t care about this emergency, because I know that they can make it out.\" And now that counter has almost reset to zero, and you have to build that back up again.",
      "I don\u2019t think it changes the tone of the show in the sense that the show is one that is always switching between genres. We have super light episodes, and then we\u2019ll have a really dark arc. I think that\u2019s been one of the strengths of the show, is that it really does offer tonal changes, sometimes not even episode to episode, but scene to scene.",
      "So obviously, post death, the tone has been darker. But it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t gone into a darker tone for three, four, five episodes at a time before. It doesn\u2019t mean that that is now the tone of the show. I absolutely look forward to the lighter episodes as well, once we are through that first stage of grieving.",
      "The tone on set is, you know, he\u2019s obviously missed. He\u2019s loved by all of us. But you have to remember, we have to remember, Peter is fine. Peter is not dead. Peter is not Bobby. And as with anything, nothing is set in stone any one way, like you can be sad in one moment, and you can be laughing in the next. That\u2019s the human experience, and that\u2019s how you deal with heavy things, as you often do make light of them.",
      "There are absolutely moments, many moments where he\u2019s missed. But we also find the lighter moments day to day as well. And we still have to have a good time. And we can\u2019t be in mourning forever. We have to, and want to, have a great time doing the job that we love.",
      "I said to Tim that one thing I was excited about moving forward from this is I wanted to use it as a chance to help mature Buck. We've seen a lot of growth in Buck over the years \u2014 subtle in some senses.",
      "But if I was to watch the pilot today, and then if I was to watch the most recent episode, I'd go, \"Oh, that\u2019s a lot of growth.\" But I think there was something still lacking in terms of taking him to the next level. And I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage. So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.",
      "I think Athena said this in the show once, \"You were being Buck,\" or something. He will go through whatever he has to to help the people that he loves, as we\u2019ve seen. Even through the lab episodes, trying to get the cure when it was Chimney on the line.",
      "I think having that moment of Bobby shutting that door, and there is nothing Buck could do. There are variations when we shot it of trying to get into the room, to no success, and what could you do, but it\u2019s more just me shouldering the door and trying to smash my way through it. But it\u2019s just hopeless.",
      "There\u2019s a sense of being defeated. And I think he learns from that that you change the things that you can and you have to accept the things that you can\u2019t. And that\u2019s what Buck has had to do. If the change is there to be made, we\u2019ll see him go to the ends of the earth for it. And now he\u2019s learning that he has to accept the things when there is nothing to be done.",
      "The finale of \"9-1-1\" Season Eight will air on ABC May 15 at 8 p.m. ET and stream the next day on Hulu."

      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not shooting her today. Her eyes are baggy.\u2019 And I was 25, so for him to say that, it was very embarrassing,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo as soon as the movie finished, I ended up having some plastic surgery.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s just not what you want to do when you\u2019re 25 or 26.

    "summary": "The Kremlin confirmed Thursday that Russia's President Putin would skip Moscow's first direct peace negotiations with Ukraine that Putin himself had suggested.",
    "story": [
      "ISTANBUL \u2014 High-stakes peace talks Thursday between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Vladimir Putin hit speed bumps as the Kremlin confirmed he would be skipping the negotiations and President Donald Trump added that \"nothing\" would happen unless he and his Russian counterpart attended.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital, Ankara, as well as in Antalya and Istanbul \u2014 where some 200 journalists and crew were massed outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace with no clear idea of when talks would get underway. The talks were later postponed for Friday.",
      "The build-up to Thursday's talks had included a back and forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration which hinted at the possibility of a three-way meeting involving Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That did not ultimately materialize.",
      "While speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the United Arab Emirates, Trump was asked about the level of the delegation Russia sent to Turkey.",
      "\u201cLook, nothing\u2019s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?\u201d he said, adding that Putin did not lead the delegation because Trump had chosen not to attend. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going if I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Later on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he would meet with the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on Friday. Echoing Trump's comments, he reaffirmed that the involvement of both Trump and Putin would be \"the only way we're going to have a breakthrough\" in the war.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. will decide on a timeline for a possible meeting between Trump and Putin after the Friday talks, adding that the president is willing to \u201cstick with\u201d the process as long as it takes to achieve peace.",
      "Prior to Rubio's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had told CNN \u201cno,\u201d when asked whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey, and had separately said at the time that there were \u201cno preparations\u201d for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and Britain presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks. After his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President JD Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of \u201casking for too much\u201d in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump\u2019s major gripe with Ukraine \u2014 that American taxpayers have mostly funded its defense \u2014 was soothed after the two nations struck a minerals deal that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump\u2019s calls to accept Putin\u2019s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation, as well as American diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see \u2014 it looks like not a serious level,\u201d Zelenskyy said, using a Ukrainian word meaning \"sham\" or \"theatrical.\"",
      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",
      "That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team has done little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was \u201cready for serious work,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry's Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "Ukraine responded to the scaling-down of the talks by vascillating over whether it would even send a delegation to Istanbul, as Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m. ET) at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, that shifted to midday and then after 5 p.m, before being postponed to Friday.",
      "Further illustrating the confusion in Istanbul, American personnel were seen late Thursday morning still appearing to prepare a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German shepherd dog.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Istanbul, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."

The country recorded nearly 800 cases in 2024, a decrease from previous years. Victims tended to have preexisting familial or communal relationships with their aggressors, according to Statista.",

According to Tuesday\u2019s statement, Marquez\u2019s body was set to be transferred to the facilities at the\u00a0Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, where it would await official identification and an autopsy."

    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",

      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",

      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",

      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",

He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and successful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

      "On Wednesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he didn\u2019t know how an Emirati-backed firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company\u2019s digital coin for $2 billion.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is a big cryptocurrency fan and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t lead in crypto and AI, China will. Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",
      "Asked if the Saudi-financed and Trump-linked LIV Golf tour came up during his conversations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the last two days, Trump said it had not. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he added. He also sidestepped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s threat to block his nominees until there are more answers on a high-priced jet that Qatar has offered as a gift and instead mused that there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d with Schumer, a New York Democrat.",
      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",
      "The Trump-branded projects have drawn scrutiny in Washington from the president's political opponents and even some allies, who point out that the president has not divested from the Trump Organization and continues to profit from \u2014 and personally promote \u2014 these business ventures in his second term. The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, \"Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump\u2019s Administration is committed to full transparency.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",
      "And Trump has defended as \u201ca great gesture\u201d the Qatari jet gift, saying before leaving Washington that turning it down would be foolish. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding that it would go to his presidential library foundation once he leaves office. Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",
      "Democrats in Washington are capitalizing on the controversy, with the Democratic National Committee announcing plans to fly a banner that reads \u201cQatar-a-Lago\u201d over Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Wednesday.\u00a0Some Republican allies of the president have also raised concerns about the jet: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson called the gift a \"very odd offer,\" and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the plane could bring \"significant espionage and surveillance problems.\"",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed concerns about the Trump family\u2019s foreign business dealings, claiming he did not have expertise on the matter and stressing that Trump has been transparent.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nothing to hide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very upfront.\u201d He stressed that ethics oversight is in place and emphasized that his focus is on leading the House. And he said Qatar\u2019s gift of the plane was \u201cto the country,\u201d not Trump personally.",
      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

This week, the crossing that straddles the Rhine river as it meanders across the borders with nearby France and Germany was lined with flags bearing the Eurovision Song Contest slogan, \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d",
      "Basel, and Europe at large, are anything but united.",
      "Police and the the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are preparing themselves for a potential repeat of last year\u2019s iteration of Eurovision, the song competition that launched the careers of ABBA and 1988 winner Celine Dion. The 2024 contest was overshadowed by politics perhaps more than in any previous year, with fierce protests over the participation of Israel amid its government\u2019s intensifying war on Gaza.",
      "It\u2019s purely by chance that this year\u2019s contest, usually an outrageous jamboree of inscrutable lyrics and scantily clad backing dancers, is being held in a country with a long-standing policy of neutrality. Each year\u2019s venue is dictated by which country won the previous year.",
      "The EBU, which organizes the contest, says the event is nonpolitical, but given that it brings together dozens of countries \u2014 this year, 37 nations will take part \u2014 the divisions and flashpoints present on the world stage inevitably creep in among the pyrotechnic reveling.",
      "The political divide over Israel\u2019s participation in Basel has already tested the EBU\u2019s impartiality.",
      "Israel shattered a fragile two-month ceasefire earlier this year, as its military intensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Strip and enforces a total blockade of food, medicine and goods from entering the enclave, where more than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "The war began following the Hamas-led terror attacks on several sites in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 people. One of those sites was the Nova music festival, where around 360 people were killed.",
      "The singer representing Israel, which first took part in the contest in 1973, is Yuval Raphael \u2014 one of the survivors of that attack.",
      "Last year, Raphael spoke to the United Nations Human Rights Council, describing how she sought refuge in a bomb shelter with other festivalgoers, hiding for eight hours under dead bodies. She told the U.N., \u201cthe physical injuries I sustained are healing, but the mental scars will stay with me forever.\u201d",
      "The EBU bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "While the lyrics of this year\u2019s song, \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d don\u2019t make reference to any events in particular, Galia Press-Barnathan, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the message is nevertheless clear."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A New Zealand parliamentary committee has recommended the unprecedented suspensions of three M\u0101ori lawmakers for performing a protest haka in the debating chamber last year.",
      "The haka is a chanting dance of challenge of great cultural importance in New Zealand, and the three lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, performed one to oppose a controversial bill that would have redefined the country\u2019s founding document.",
      "On Wednesday a committee recommended record suspensions and severe censure \u2014 the harshest penalties ever assigned to New Zealand parliamentarians \u2014 after finding the trio in contempt of Parliament.",
      "Government bloc lawmakers, who hold the majority, are expected to endorse the penalties in a vote Tuesday. But Parliament\u2019s Speaker Gerry Brownlee took the unusual step Thursday of saying he would first allow unlimited debate before the vote due to the severity of the proposed punishments.",
      "The recommendations were the latest twist in the fraught saga over the bill, now defeated, that opponents said would have provoked constitutional havoc and reversed decades of progress for M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "Video of the legislators in full cry drew global attention last November. The bill they opposed was vanquished at a second vote in April.",
      "However, some lawmakers from the center-right government objected to the M\u0101ori Party legislators\u2019 protest during the first vote and complained to parliament\u2019s speaker. At issue was the way the trio walked across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while they performed the haka.",
      "\u201cIt is not acceptable to physically approach another member on the floor of the debating chamber,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report said, adding that the behavior could be considered intimidating. The committee denied the legislators were being punished for the haka, which is a beloved and sacred cultural institution in New Zealand life, but \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed\u201d during a vote, according to the findings.",
      "The committee deciding the fate of the lawmakers has members from all political parties. The government\u2019s opponents disagreed with parts or all of the decision but were overruled.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, and the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Judith Collins.",
      "The three legislators did not appear before the committee when summoned in April because they said Parliament does not respect M\u0101ori cultural protocol and they would not get a fair hearing.",
      "\u201cThe process was grossly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted, resulting in an extreme sanction,\u201d M\u0101ori party spokesperson and lawmaker Mariameno Kapa-Kingi said in a statement. \u201cThis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The report recommended that Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest lawmaker, be suspended from Parliament for seven days. The co-leaders of her political party, Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, face 21-day bans.",
      "Three days is the longest a lawmaker has been barred from the House before. Suspended legislators are not paid during their bans.",
      "Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer, the leaders of the party that advocates M\u0101ori rights and holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, have lambasted the committee\u2019s process as intolerant of M\u0101ori principles and identity.",
      "The pair received more severe sanctions than Maipi-Clarke because the younger lawmaker had written a letter of \u201ccontrition\u201d to the committee, the report said.",
      "The Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill sought to redefine New Zealand\u2019s founding document, the 1840 pact between the British Crown and M\u0101ori leaders signed during New Zealand\u2019s colonization.",
      "The English and M\u0101ori language versions of the treaty differed, and the Crown immediately began to breach both, resulting in mass land thefts and generations of disenfranchisement for M\u0101ori, who remain disadvantaged on almost every metric. But in recent decades, M\u0101ori protest movements have wrought growing recognition of the Treaty\u2019s promises in New Zealand\u2019s law, politics and public life.",
      "That produced billion-dollar land settlements with tribes and strategies to advance Indigenous language and culture. Such policies were the target of the bill, drawn up by a minor libertarian party that denounced what it said was special treatment for M\u0101ori as they tried to rewrite the treaty\u2019s promises."

    "story": [
      "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 An Australian local government has decided against repairing an often-vandalized monument to renowned British explorer James Cook because it would be destroyed again. But the mayor on Wednesday rejected accusations that the vandals have won.",
      "Statues and monuments to the 18th-century naval officer are common in Australia and are often defaced by opponents of Britain\u2019s settlement of the country without a treaty with its Indigenous people. In 1770, then Lt. Cook charted the Australian east coast where Sydney would become the first British colony on the continent.",
      "The granite and bronze monument to the master navigator and cartographer in an inner-city Melbourne park was vandalized days after the anniversary of the first British settlers\u2019 arrival at Sydney Cove was commemorated on Jan. 26. Opponents of Australia Day celebrations denounce the public holiday as \u201cInvasion Day.\u201d There are growing calls for the country to find a less divisive national day.",
      "The monument in Melbourne\u2019s Edinburgh Gardens was snapped at its base and spray painted with the words \u201ccook the colony.\u201d",
      "Mayor Stephen Jolly, head of the Yarra City Council, which is a municipality near the heart of Melbourne, said his fellow councilors had voted unanimously on Tuesday night against spending 15,000 Australian dollars ($9,700) on repairing the monument, which remains in storage.",
      "Jolly said the decision to permanently remove the monument, which included an image of Cook\u2019s face cast in bronze, was about economics rather than taking a position in Australia\u2019s culture wars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being economically rational. It\u2019s AU$15,000 a pop every time we have to repair it and it\u2019s persistently getting either demolished or vandalized or tagged,\u201d Jolly told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of ratepayers\u2019 money. We can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "But Victoria state\u2019s Melbourne-based conservative opposition leader, Brad Battin, condemned removing such memorials as surrendering to vandals.",
      "\u201cWe need to stand strong and remember the fact that this is part of our history,\u201d Battin told reporters.",
      "\u201cIf you start to remove the history of our state and our country because of activists, then you\u2019re actually giving in to those that are campaigning against it,\u201d Battin added.",
      "Jolly disagreed that his council had given the vandals what they wanted.",
      "\u201cNo, I think they would\u2019ve loved for us to put it back up and then they could\u2019ve just tagged it again or destroyed it again and just had this ongoing sort of little war going on in Edinburgh Gardens,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re probably the most disappointed people that it\u2019s not going to be there anymore,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "The base of the monument remained at the entrance to the park on Wednesday with a traffic cone attached to warn cyclists, joggers and pedestrians of the trip hazard it presents. Someone has scrawled a smiling face and a torso on the cone in an apparent reference to the memorial that had once stood in its place.",
      "Jolly said a local branch of the Captain Cook Society, an international group that celebrates the explorer, has offered to preserve the bronze plaques.",
      "Melbourne-based society member Bill Lang said discussions were underway to find a short-term home for the monument, such as a museum.",
      "Lang said the council\u2019s decision not to repair the monument was disheartening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for every open-minded Australian that believes that there are lots of things that we can learn about and learn from our history that we should celebrate,\u201d Lang said."

      "Jetlagged but excited, Pope Leo XIV\u2019s brother, John Prevost, is catching up on daily life after a whirlwind few days in the Vatican.",
      "Prevost is freshly arrived home after spending time with his brother following his election to the papacy. He said his priorities when he got home were mowing the lawn, enjoying a beer and letting a wild new reality set in.",
      "\u201cThis is as life-altering event for everybody, not just for the Catholic Church,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stunned at how quickly the vote went.\u201d",
      "During his time in Rome, Prevost attended multiple events with his brother, going on two different church trips outside the Vatican, and he said the massive crowds were an incredible sight.",
      "\u201cIt was supposed to be secret, but all the way there, both sides, jammed, four or five people deep,\u201d Prevost said. \u201cScreaming and hollering, \u2018Papa! Papa! Papa!\u2019 He rolled down his window and shook hands with as many people as he could. It just changed their facial expression.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been plenty of talk of what the pope\u2019s philosophy will be and whether it will represent a departure from his predecessor or a continuation of his work, but Prevost said his brother recognizes that \u201cpeople are looking for hope\u201d and that he wants to focus on unity.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019ll be a second Pope Francis,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost also shared photos with NBC Chicago of his parents and his siblings, and said he believed his brother was always destined for a critically important role.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a man of the world. And so what better person to be pope,\u201d he said.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Prevost said that things are still slowly sinking in.",
      "\u201cYou also feel a sense of pride, a sense of, 'Is this for real?'\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hit me until last night \u2014 that this is for real, life-changing, and then life will go on.\u201d",
      "Prevost also said there was a stack of mail at his home when he returned, but that plenty of it was meant for the new pope.",
      "\u201cPeople bore their souls, so I\u2019m going to give them something back,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost said he was amused by the White Sox's reaction to the news that his brother was a fan of the South Siders, and also answered another critical question for a Chicagoan: thin-crust or deep-dish pizza?",
      "\u201cThin crust, because that\u2019s what I like too,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost asked the public to continue praying for his brother, who will be formally inaugurated as pope in a Mass on Sunday.",
      "\"Keep watching and keep praying,\" Prevost said. \"I think this is going to be a great thing for the church and for the country and the world.\""

      "Maikelys Espinoza arrived at an airport outside the capital, Caracas, along with more than 220 deported migrants. Footage aired by state television showed Venezuela\u2019s first lady Cilia Flores carrying Maikelys at the airport. Later, Flores was shown handing the girl over to her mother, who had been waiting for her arrival at the presidential palace along with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\u201cHere is everyone\u2019s beloved little girl. She is the daughter and granddaughter of all of us,\u201d Maduro said.",
      "The U.S. government had claimed the family separation last month was justified because the girl\u2019s parents allegedly have ties to the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang, which U.S. President Donald Trump designated a terrorist organization earlier this year.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother was deported to Venezuela on April 25. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities sent her father to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March under Trump\u2019s invocation of an 18th-century wartime law to deport hundreds of immigrants.",
      "For years, the government of Maduro had mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. But since Trump took office this year, hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have been deported to their home country.",
      "The Trump administration has said the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo and El Salvador are members of the Tren de Aragua, but has offered little evidence to back up the allegation.",
      "Maduro on Wednesday thanked Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, for allowing Maikelys to reunite with her mother in a \u201cprofoundly humane\u201d act. Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas shortly after Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThere have been and will be differences, but it is possible, with God\u2019s blessing, to move forward and resolve many issues,\u201d Maduro said, alluding to the deep divisions between his and Trump\u2019s governments. \u201cI hope and aspire that very soon we can also rescue Maikelys\u2019 father and the 253 Venezuelans who are in El Salvador.\u201d"

    "summary": "House Republicans want to tax remittances, which would cover over 40 million people in the U.S.,  including green card and visa holders who send money to families.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel Vail\u2019s entire life in the small western Guatemalan town of Cajol\u00e1 is built off the money that his three children send home from the United States.",
      "The money from their construction jobs paid for the two-story white home where Vail now lives \u2014 and where his children, who are in the U.S. illegally, would also reside if they ever get deported. Vail, 53, invested some of the money in opening a local food shop, which he uses to keep his family afloat.",
      "In small migratory towns like Cajol\u00e1, it is not unusual for the entire economy to be built off remittances, the funds sent by migrant workers back to their home countries.",
      "\u201cPeople here, they don\u2019t live luxuriously, but they live off remittances,\u201d Vail said.",
      "House Republicans have included in President Donald Trump\u2019s big priority bill a 5% excise tax on remittance transfers that would cover more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "Trump also recently announced that he is finalizing a presidential memorandum to \u201cshut down remittances\u201d sent by people in the U.S. illegally. White House and Treasury officials have not responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press on specifics of the presidential memorandum that Trump previewed in an April 25 Truth Social post and how it would work.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum shot back on the measure and called on Republican lawmakers to reconsider it, saying it \u201cwould damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States\u2019, which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\u201d she said in a morning press briefing.",
      "Remittance experts, local leaders and former migrants say that banning, limiting or adding a tax on certain remittances could damage communities that rely on them, prove burdensome to American citizens and firms and, paradoxically, end up causing even more illegal migration to the U.S.",
      "The influx of money provides an important economic lifeline to residents of poorer towns that often have little access to jobs or income. Remittances provide opportunities for people in their home country, making it less likely they would take the risk of migrating to the United States, the experts say.",
      "\u201cAny measure to reduce remittances will have a negative impact on the U.S. national interest,\u201d said Manuel Orozco, director of the Migration, Remittances, and Development Program at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt will have an effect on the homeland.\u201d",
      "Proponents of efforts to target remittances say they are an effective tax on people in the U.S. illegally and could be a revenue generator for the U.S. government.",
      "Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, acknowledges that limiting, banning or taxing remittances would make it more difficult for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cOne of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cIf that\u2019s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.\u201d",
      "Legislation to control remittances \u2014 through taxes on money transfers, both internationally and domestically \u2014 has been proposed in 18 states in the past few years. Almost all of those efforts have been voted down.",
      "The exception is Oklahoma, which in 2009 passed a tax on remittances: a $5 fee on any wire transfer under $500 and 1% on any amount in excess of $500.",
      "Steven Yates, who is now a senior research fellow at the Heritage Institute, wrote for the America First Policy Institute that every state should adopt this policy as a way to combat the impact of illegal immigration.",
      "Other high-ranking Trump administration officials have also supported efforts to tighten controls on remittances. Vice President JD Vance, as an Ohio senator in 2023, co-sponsored the WIRED Act, which would have imposed a 10% fee on remittances out of the U.S.",
      "The intention of the bill \u2014 which would allow people who could prove their citizenship to get the fee back as a refundable tax credit \u2014 was \u201cpenalizing illicit activity, such as drug and human smuggling.\u201d The bill did not make it out of committee.",
      "\u201cThis legislation is a common sense solution to disincentivize illegal immigration and reduce the cartels\u2019 financial power,\u201d Vance said at the time of the bill\u2019s introduction.",
      "According to the World Bank, remittances sent to home countries in 2023 totaled about $656 billion \u2014 equivalent to the gross domestic product of Belgium. The money that Mexican migrants send home to their relatives grew by 7.6% in 2023 to reach a record $63.3 billion for the year.",
      "Remittances are also a major factor in the global economy, often sent from American wire services rather than banks and credit unions. India, Mexico and China are the biggest recipients of those funds, according to the World Bank.",
      "In response to the proposal to tax remittances in the new Republican House bill, Orozco said, \u201cSome senders would find ways to send money differently, through unauthorized channels. Others would send less.\u201d",
      "\u201cSending less would have an impact on the receiving households, limiting the capacity to save, and in turn may increase the intention to migrate,\u201d said Orozco, who also serves as a senior fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Center for International Development.",
      "In Cajol\u00e1, local leaders say the remittance flow has stopped young people from migrating because they see economic opportunities they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. Vail said losing that lifeline would deal a devastating blow to families like his and even cause his small business to fold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Vail said. \u201cFear that for the people that live here in Guatemala, there won\u2019t be work because the businesses will be all gone.\u201d",
      "He said his business has already been struggling since Trump took office and his sales of things like eggs, beans, sugar and more have dipped.",
      "\u201cWhen Donald Trump won, many people stopped sending remittances or they began to save money,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness dropped off a lot.\u201d"

      "According to Jason Wong, who works in product logistics for Temu in Hong Kong, his company stalled shipments from China after the end of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfill orders.",

      "The reduction in tariffs on low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight\u2019s Kumar.",
      "In anticipation of changes to the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as\u00a0Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.",
      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",
      "The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.",

      "Trump said he not only helped mediate the ceasefire, but also offered mediation over the simmering dispute in Kashmir, a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety but administer in parts. The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, which has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.",
      "New Delhi also declined Trump\u2019s offer for mediation on Tuesday.",

      "In a tit-for-tat move last month, India and Pakistan reduced each other\u2019s diplomatic presence in Islamabad and New Delhi. So far, none of the expelled diplomats have returned. Pakistan and India routinely expel each other\u2019s diplomats over allegations of espionage."
