      "Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have announced the reissue of 1973's \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- They're not going their own way anymore. After much speculation, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham announced Wednesday the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d more than 50 years after the release of their only full-length album as a duo.",
      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Buckingham shared, completing the lyric.",
      "In 2011, Buckingham told Uncut that he and Nicks had \u201cevery intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can\u2019t put any specifics on that.\u201d In 2013, on the album\u2019s 40th anniversary, Fleetwood Mac released \u201cExtended Play,\u201d their first new studio material since 2003\u2019s \u201cSay You Will.\u201d The four-track collection featured a song titled \u201cWithout You,\u201d which had been originally slated for \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "The reissued version of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d features the same album cover as the original, despite Nicks' public dissatisfaction with the photograph, telling classic rock magazine MOJO that she \u201cfelt like a rat in a trap\u201d during the shoot.",

So when they suggested they shoot Lindsey and I nude I could not have been more terrified if you\u2019d asked me to jump off a speeding train,\u201d Nicks told MOJO in 2013. \u201cLindsey was like, \u2018Oh, come on \u2014 this is art. Don\u2019t be a child!\u2019 I thought, \u2018Who are you? Don\u2019t you know me?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d was released one year before they joined Fleetwood Mac, and was met with little commercial success. But it did attract the attention of Mick Fleetwood, who invited Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham in turn insisted Nicks come, too. The two, then a couple, became the central faces, voices and songwriters of the group for the four decades that followed.",
      "The pair\u2019s tumultuous relationship appeared across the band\u2019s discography: She wrote \u201cDreams\u201d about him. He wrote \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d about her. Infamously, they broke up while writing the 1977 hit album \u201cRumours.\u201d Footage of Nicks staring down Buckingham 20 years later during a performance of \u201cSilver Springs\u201d routinely goes viral (\u201cYou'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you,\u201d Nicks and Buckingham sing in unison, at one point, holding each other's gaze.)",
      "Buckingham left the band in 1987, returning in 1996. The last time the band reunited, however, for a 2018-2019 tour, the rest of the members kicked Buckingham out, and as a result, he sued them. He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "Both Buckingham and Nicks have also released reams of solo music. Some fans had theorized that Nicks and Buckingham were teasing a Fleetwood Mac reunion, which would have been the first since the death of vocalist, songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie in 2022.",
      "Last year, Nicks told MOJO that without McVie, \u201cthere is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way.\u201d",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia would be the fourth of five people charged in connection with Perry's death to plead guilty.",

      "He had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Plasencia's attorneys emphasized in an email after he reached his agreement that he \u201cwas not treating Matthew Perry at the time of his death and the ketamine that caused Mr. Perry\u2019s death was not provided by Dr. Plasencia.\u201d",
      "The remaining charges can carry a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and there is no guarantee he'll get less, but he's likely to. Plasencia has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August. He will not be sentenced until a future hearing.",
      "The only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the \u201cKetamine Queen\u201d and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.",

      "But with the debut of his family reality show on MTV, the world learned what those who'd been paying closer attention already knew: Ozzy Osbourne was soft and fuzzy under the darkness.",
      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",
      "Danny Deraney, a publicist who worked with Osbourne and was a lifelong fan, said of the show, \"You saw some guy who was curious. You saw some guy who was being funny. You just saw pretty much the real thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that everyone associates with the \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019 and all this craziness,\u201d Deraney said. \"And people loved him.

      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",
      "\u201cYou were seeing this really fascinating, appealing, bizarre tension between the public persona of a celebrity and their mundane experiences at home,\u201d said Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic for Vulture and New York Magazine.",

      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",

      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",

      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Netflix\u2019s new reality show, \u201cBuilding the Band,\u201d unexpectedly became Liam Payne\u2019s last major appearance \u2014 moments the show\u2019s hosts say they, along with contestants and viewers, are lucky to have.",
      "The show features Payne as a guest judge, offering pointed but witty advice to young bands chasing success not unlike what he achieved as part of the culture-shifting boy band, One Direction. Payne died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, not long after the show\u2019s production wrapped.",
      "\u201cGetting to see the real, true him that the world gets to remember him for, which you\u2019ll see on this show, is just a beautiful thing,\u201d says the Backstreet Boys\u2019 AJ McLean, the show\u2019s host.",
      "\u201cBuilding the Band\u201d flips traditional music competitions on their head, bringing together 50 up-and-coming artists who are tasked with singing for each other and forming groups based on those performances. The catch? They can\u2019t see how anyone looks.",
      "The first batch of episodes premiered in early July and the last few episodes, including the finale, will drop Wednesday. The show ultimately follows six bands working to develop their group sound and performances \u2014 until only one band is left standing, winning the $500,000 prize.",
      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",
      "The series opened with a dedication to Payne and his family, in which McLean said they \u201cnever imagined we'd soon be saying goodbye to our friend\u201d while filming the show.",
      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",
      "Landon Boyce, a member of the show's other boy band, Soulidified, told The Associated Press that Payne left a lasting impact and was a leading example of how he hopes to carry himself as a performer.",
      "\u201cI remember Liam just said, \u2018Have fun,\u2019\u201d Boyce says. \u201cHe just told us, \u2018I wish One Direction kind of, like, did what you guys were doing.\u2019 And I kind of just took that as like, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d",
      "Payne is seen nodding along with excitement during the band's showcase performance, when they sang \u201cSure Thing\u201d by Miguel. Bradley Rittmann, another Soulidified member, told the AP they were \u201con Cloud 9\u201d after Payne said he would join their band.",

      "This show mashes together the likes of \u201cLove is Blind\u201d with music competition shows like \u201cThe Voice,\u201d secluding contestants in pods, where they can only hear each other. Contestants can express interest by hitting a button during the performance, and then speak through voice chats to test their chemistry.",
      "The initial 50 contestants dwindled to just 22, comprising two boy bands, three girl bands and one mixed-gender group. Contestants chose their bandmates without input from the host or judges.",
      "\u201cIt formed in the most real, raw, authentic way,\u201d says Aaliyah Rose Larsen, a member of the mixed-gender band SZN4. \u201cI think we would have re-found each other in a million other lifetimes, in a billion other shows, because we were always meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "The result of this process, judges say, are bands that labels traditionally wouldn\u2019t form, given members\u2019 differences in style and appearance \u2014 an important pillar of the show, McLean and Rowland say, given the current state of the music industry.",
      "\u201cBack in the beginning of our careers, your sophomore album was the one that would make or break you. Now you get one shot,\u201d McLean says. \u201cTo be able to give the power back to these individuals, to let them put each other together based on just raw talent and chemistry, never seeing each other, is a testament to truly what it is to be in a band.\u201d",
      "An audience vote determines which bands continue on after each live performance. The last episode of the first batch left viewers on a cliffhanger, as Midnight 'til Morning and girl group Siren Society were voted in the bottom two. The next batch will reveal who was eliminated.",

      "\u201cHe was just honest. He called everything out, you know what I mean? Before they saw it, before we saw it,\u201d Rowland says, adding that Payne had \u201cmany shining moments\u201d during his storied and decorated career, \u201cbut this was a really incredible one.\u201d",
      "Nori Moore, a member of 3Quency, \u201chad a lot of firsts\u201d in the show as a young performer and says Payne\u2019s advice to contestants that they claim the moment every time they walk onstage was pivotal to her development as an artist.",
      "Larsen says viewers can watch the show and \u201csee his heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know how much he loves the show,\u201d says Katie Roeder, another SZN4 member. \u201cI know he\u2019s very proud of us and looking down on us.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",

While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",
      "Bruce hinted later Tuesday that further U.S. withdrawal from international organizations could be coming as a result of the ongoing review to ensure \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in international organizations will focus on advancing American interests with clarity and conviction.\u201d",

He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",
      "Taylor said the festival is a door opener for the athletes.",

      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year.

      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",

There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",

      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",

      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",

      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",

      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance.

That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",

      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Shares of drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics continued to sink Tuesday after the company said it would comply with a Food and Drug Administration request to pause shipments of its gene therapy following several patient deaths.",
      "The decision, announced late Monday, comes just days after the company rebuffed FDA regulators in an extremely unusual decision that alarmed investors and analysts.",
      "Sarepta CEO Doug Ingram said the company seeks a \u201cproductive and positive\u201d relationship with FDA and that \u201cmaintaining that productive working relationship required this temporary suspension.\u201d",

      "The therapy was already under FDA scrutiny after two teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury, a known side effect of the treatment. Then the company last week disclosed a third death with a different therapy: a 51-year-old patient who was enrolled in a company trial for another form of muscular dystrophy.",
      "FDA responded on Friday by asking the company to immediately halt all shipments of Elevidys. Company executives initially refused, noting that the latest death was not tied to Elevidys, its best-selling product.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency.

McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible.

      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office.

      "Three Democratic-led states that led the way in offering free health care to low-income people who are in the U.S. without legal permission are either limiting or ending the programs because of significant budget concerns",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister \u2014 a nurse in Mexico \u2014 for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband\u2019s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California.",
      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",

      "Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage, and adults lacking permanent legal status can buy private health insurance.",

      "State lawmakers said California\u2019s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues \u2014 a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",
      "\u201cIt was a total triumph,\u201d she said of Medi-Cal expansion. \u201cBut now that all of this is coming our way, we\u2019re going backwards to a worse place.\u201d",
      "Fear and tension about immigration raids are changing patient behavior, too. Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",

      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",

      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian activists called for more protests Wednesday against a law they say weakens the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies, following the first major demonstration against the country's government in more than three years of war. The legislation has also drawn rebukes from European Union officials and international rights groups.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, under pressure as the change threatened to endanger his public support at a critical time in the war, convened the heads of Ukraine's key anti-corruption and security agencies Wednesday morning in a response to the outcry against his decision to approve the new law that was passed by Parliament.",

A detailed joint action plan is expected within two weeks, aimed at addressing institutional weaknesses, removing legal hurdles, and ensuring justice across the board, he said.",

      "Britain\u2019s Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008",
      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "The charges against Tom Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and Carlo Palombo, who worked for Barclays, centered around alleged efforts to influence the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, and its euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used to set the interest rates on trillions of dollars of loans and other financial products around the world.",
      "The court ruled that the convictions of Hayes and Palombo were unfair because the judges in their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions to jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering the key question of whether the traders had acted dishonestly.",
      "\u201cThat misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,\u201d Judge George Leggatt wrote in an 82-page decision backed by all five members of the panel that heard the case.",
      "Hayes was convicted in August 2015 and sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison, which was later reduced to 11 years. Palombo, convicted in March 2019, was sentenced to four years in prison. Both men were released in 2021.",
      "\u201cIt destroyed my family, I missed most of my son\u2019s childhood,\u201d Hayes told the BBC.",
      "\u201cFor so long I\u2019ve been an international fugitive \u2026 and now I can move on with my life, or try to,\u201d he added.",
      "The decision came after the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal in 2022 overturned the convictions of two traders charged with similar crimes in the United States. Hayes and Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected by British judges, were allowed to take their case to the U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.",

      "Libor and Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used to set the interest rates on everything from business loans to home mortgages and credit card debts. As a result, they also became central to more complex financial transactions such as those used by banks and businesses to bet on interest rate fluctuations.",
      "The benchmarks were vulnerable to manipulation because they were set by banks that could profit from swings in interest rates.",
      "Each day, major international banks were asked to submit the interest rate at which they could borrow money from other banks. An average of those submissions was then used to set the daily Libor and Euribor rates.",
      "During the financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially low Libor submissions to make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought to influence the submissions made by their banks as even small moves in the benchmark rates could boost their profits.",
      "Those risks became even more pronounced during the financial crisis, when lending dried up and bankers had to base their daily submissions on a subjective assessment of the market rather than actual loans.",
      "Libor and Euribor were phased out in recent years, in part because they were seen as worsening the financial crisis.",

      "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing for hours over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland.",
      "Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record.",
      "Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.",
      "The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.",
      "Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. It also has established a dedicated center for improving drone tactics and better training for those flying them.",
      "Russian engineers have changed the original Iranian Shahed to increase its altitude and make it harder to intercept, according to Russian military bloggers and Western analysts. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. Some use artificial intelligence to operate autonomously.",
      "The original Shahed and its Russian replica \u2014 called \u201cGeran,\u201d or \u201cgeranium\u201d \u2014 have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works.",
      "The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.",
      "Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.",
      "A report Sunday by state-run Zvezda TV described the Alabuga factory as the world's biggest attack drone plant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a war of drones. We are ready for it,\u201d said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school.",
      "The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: \u201cKurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.\u201d",
      "The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named \u201cGerbera\u201d for a type of daisy. They closely resemble the attack drones and are intended to confuse Ukrainian defenses and distract attention from their more deadly twins.",
      "By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases.",
      "Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote.",

      "Ukraine relies on mobile teams armed with machine guns as a low-cost response to the drones to spare the use of expensive Western-supplied air defense missiles. It also has developed interceptor drones and is working to scale up production, but the steady rise in Russian attacks is straining its defenses.",
      "Despite international sanctions and a growing load on its economy, Russia\u2019s military spending this year has risen 3.4% over 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which estimated it at the equivalent of about $200 billion. While budgetary pressures could increase, it said, the current spending level is manageable for the Kremlin.",
      "Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered to the military last year, said President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Frontelligence Insight, a Ukraine-based open-source intelligence organization, reported this month that Russia launched more than 28,000 Shahed and Geran drones since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with 10% of the total fired last month alone.",
      "While ballistic and cruise missiles are faster and pack a bigger punch, they cost millions and are available only in limited quantities. A Geran drone costs only tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 a fraction of a ballistic missile.",
      "The drones' range of about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) allows them to bypass some defenses, and a relatively big load of 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of explosives makes them a highly effective instrument of what the Center for Strategic and International Studies calls \u201ca cruel attritional logic.\u201d",
      "CSIS called them \u201dthe most cost-effective munition in Russia\u2019s firepower strike arsenal.\"",
      "\u201cRussia\u2019s plan is to intimidate our society,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow seeks to launch 700 to 1,000 drones a day. Over the weekend, German Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding said in an interview that Russia aims for a capability of launching 2,000 drones in one attack.",
      "Along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, short-range attack drones have become prolific and transformed the fighting, quickly spotting and targeting troops and weapons within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) kill zone.",
      "Russian drone units initially were set on the initiative of midlevel commanders and often relied on equipment purchased with private donations. Once drones became available in big numbers, the military moved last fall to put those units under a single command.",
      "Putin has endorsed the Defense Ministry\u2019s proposal to make drones a separate branch of the armed forces, dubbed the Unmanned Systems Troops.",
      "Russia has increasingly focused on battlefield drones that use thin fiber optic cables, making them immune to jamming and have an extended range of 25 kilometers (over 15 miles). It also has set up Rubicon, a center to train drone operators and develop the best tactics.",
      "Such fiber optic drones used by both sides can venture deeper into rear areas, targeting supply, support and command structures that until recently were deemed safe.",
      "Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian advancements have raised new defensive challenges for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainian military has to evolve ways of protecting the rear, entrenching at a much greater depth,\u201d Kofman said in a recent podcast.",

      "A Syrian government investigation says sectarian violence along the coast earlier this year has left over 1,400 people dead, mostly civilians",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed in several days of sectarian violence on Syria \u2019s coast earlier this year, a government committee tasked with investigating it said Tuesday.",
      "The violence was the first major incident to emerge after the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad in December. It said there was no evidence that Syria's new military leaders ordered attacks on the Alawite community there, to which Assad belonged.",
      "Nearly 300 people suspected of committing crimes including murder, robbery, torture and looting and burning of homes and businesses were identified during the four-month investigation and referred for prosecution, and 37 people have been arrested, officials told journalists. They didn't say how many suspects were members of security forces.",
      "The committee's report came as Syria reels from a new round of sectarian violence in the south, which again has threatened to upend the country\u2019s fragile recovery from nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "The violence on the coast began on March 6 when armed groups loyal to Assad attacked security forces of the new government, killing 238 of them, the committee said. In response, security forces descended on the coast from other areas of the country, joined by thousands of armed civilians. In total, some 200,000 armed men mobilized, the committee said.",
      "As they entered neighborhoods and villages, some \u2014 including members of military factions \u2014 committed \u201cwidespread, serious violations against civilians,\u201d committee spokesperson Yasser al-Farhan said. In some cases, armed men asked civilians whether they belonged to the Alawite sect and \u201ccommitted violations based on this,\u201d he said.",
      "The committee, however, found that the \u201csectarian motives were mostly based on revenge, not ideology,\u201d he said.",
      "Judge Jumaa al-Anzi, the committee\u2019s chair, said that \u201cwe have no evidence that the (military) leaders gave orders to commit violations.\u201d",
      "He also said investigators had not received reports of girls or women being kidnapped. Some rights groups, including a United Nations commission, have documented cases of Alawite women being kidnapped in the months since the violence.",
      "There also have been scattered reports of Alawites being killed, robbed and extorted since then. Tens of thousands of members of the minority sect have fled to neighboring Lebanon.",
      "Echoes of the coastal violence resonated in the new clashes in southern Sweida province over the past two weeks.",
      "Those clashes broke out between Sunni Muslim Bedouin clans and armed groups of the Druze religious minority, and government security forces who intervened to restore order ended up siding with the Bedouins. Members of the security forces allegedly killed Druze civilians and looted and burned homes. Druze armed groups launched revenge attacks on Bedouin communities.",
      "Hundreds have been killed, and the U.N. says more than 128,500 people have been displaced. The violence has largely stopped as a ceasefire takes told.",

The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",

But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\u201cIf they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\u201d said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \u201cNone of us resent the pilots.\u201d",

It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",

      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane\u2019s right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane\u2019s left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",

The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigation at the request of bereaved families.

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",
      "The federal government, he said, is essentially telling these communities: \u201cYou aren\u2019t a priority anymore. You don\u2019t fit the plan.\u201d",
      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",
      "When the grant came up for renewal this year, it came with new restrictions that CEO Liz Roberts described as \u201cso extreme, so broad, so radical\u201d that the organization chose to walk away rather than accept conditions which would have prohibited supporting transgender survivors or treating domestic violence as a systemic issue.",
      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a flurry of trade deals that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on imports from Japan and a handful of other Asian countries",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump has announced trade deals with Japan and a handful of other Asian countries that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.",
      "A deal with China is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.",
      "Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",
      "Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump's proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.",
      "It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.",
      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam's exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.",
      "Negotiations with China are subject to an Aug. 12 deadline, but it's likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",
      "Pressure is mounting on some countries in Asia and elsewhere as the Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals approaches.",

He said they'd face even higher tariffs if they retaliate by raising their own import duties. South Korea's is set at 25%. Imports from Myanmar and Laos would be taxed at 40%, Cambodia and Thailand at 36%, Serbia and Bangladesh at 35%, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina at 30% and Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia at 25%. Nearly every country has faced a minimum 10% levy on goods entering the U.S. since April, on top of other sectoral levies.",
      "Even after Trump has pulled back from the harshest of his threatened tariffs, the onslaught of uncertainty and higher costs for both manufacturers and consumers has raised risks for the regional and global economy. Economists have been downgrading their estimates for growth in 2025 and beyond.",
      "The Asian Development Bank said Wednesday it had cut its growth estimate for economies in developing Asia and the Pacific to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.6% in 2026, down 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points.",
      "The outlook for the region could be further dimmed by an escalation of tariffs and trade friction, it said. \u201cOther risks include conflicts and geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and raise energy prices,\u201d as well as a deterioration in China's ailing property market.",
      "Economists at AMRO were less optimistic, expecting growth for Southeast Asia and other major economies in Asia at 3.8% in 2025 and 3.6% next year.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced a trade framework with Japan, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan on Tuesday, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation.",
      "\u201cThis Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States \u201cwill continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.\u201d",
      "The president said Japan would invest \u201cat my direction\u201d $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.",
      "Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together.",
      "With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker \u2014 even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.",
      "But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.",
      "The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.",
      "As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.",
      "The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.",
      "The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks.",

      "Nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, face severe challenges due to federal funding cuts",
      "For nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, the federal cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten a lifeline.",
      "Many of McDowell\u2019s 17,000 residents rely on federal programs and the nonprofits they fund to get by. The county\u2019s tax base and population have significantly declined since 1950, when McDowell was the top coal-producing county in the nation and had about 100,000 residents.",
      "Now, more than half the children in the county receive federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program benefits, and about one-third of seniors are on Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor. Decades after the Kennedy administration made the county a first test of food stamps, nearly half the county\u2019s residents receive supplemental nutrition assistance, or SNAP, the Food Stamp Program\u2019s successor.",
      "The strains created by new eligibility restrictions on SNAP as a result of the passage of President Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill will be especially dire in places like McDowell County, where more than one-third of the population lives below the federal poverty line, said Rosemary Ketchum, executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association.",
      "\u201cThese federal cuts are starving people,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the interruption in federal support tied to President Trump\u2019s January executive orders barring grants related to \u201cgender ideology\u201d; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and environmental justice, Ketchum said many of the 9,000 or so nonprofits in her state have laid off staff. Others, she said, are dipping into whatever reserves they have to pay their employees.",
      "Those reserves are slim, if they exist at all. Taken together, the seven nonprofits that receive federal grants in McDowell County run on a 3 percent operating margin, according to data tabulated by the Urban Institute\u2019s National Center for Charitable Statistics. If all federal support disappeared, the center found, all the county\u2019s nonprofits would be at risk of going under unless other funding was provided.",
      "In a poor state like West Virginia, which is already facing a budget deficit and lacks the legions of philanthropic donors who got rich on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley, nonprofits don\u2019t have a plan B, said Kathy Gentry, executive director of Safe Housing and Economic Development, or SHED, a McDowell nonprofit housing provider.",
      "The nonprofit\u2019s clients, many of whom are elderly or disabled, rely on U.S. Housing and Urban Development support to cover the rent at the 94 housing units SHED manages.",
      "Gentry\u2019s pay was temporarily cut for six weeks this spring because part of her salary comes from a HUD capacity-building grant that the administration deemed at cross-purposes with Trump\u2019s anti-DEI policy agenda. Her full paycheck resumed, but Gentry worries further cuts will force her to lay off staff.",
      "Already the nonprofit operates at a loss. In its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, SHED\u2019s $663,000 in expenses outstripped its revenue by nearly $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a quandary here \u2014 all nonprofits are,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cAre we going to exist? Will we have to dissolve?\u201d",
      "Since 2015, Heidi Binko and her team at the Just Transition Fund have worked with economic development agencies and nonprofits in areas where the coal industry once flourished. That can mean helping a local organization identify or write a grant or provide a matching grant.",
      "The fund was created by the Rockefeller Family Foundation and Appalachian Funders Network to help coal towns capture some of the dollars provided in the 2015 Clean Power Plan, or POWER Act, passed during the Obama administration. Since then, the fund says it has helped coal communities in West Virginia and throughout the nation secure more than $2 billion in federal grants.",
      "Binko hopes the fund can continue to attract federal resources to towns with high poverty rates.",

      "Two hallmarks of the Biden administration\u2019s infrastructure and stimulus acts \u2014 transitioning away from a carbon-based economy and providing federal resources among different populations equitably \u2014 are not a focus of the Trump plan. As a result, Binko fears recent progress will be dimmed.",
      "For instance, Generation West Virginia, a Just Transition Fund grantee worked with McDowell County to apply for funds from the Biden administration\u2019s Digital Equity Act to run an elementary and middle school digital literacy program. Programs under the act were terminated in May.",
      "The cancellation of the Digital Equity Act is a setback for McDowell, where 20 percent of households don\u2019t have a broadband internet connection, according to a Generation West Virginia report.",
      "Other, more basic infrastructure is lacking in the county. According to DigDeep, a nonprofit that assists with clean water access and wastewater systems and is primarily funded by private institutions, corporate partners and grassroots donations, there may be hundreds of people in the county without a dependable water supply. The exact number is unknown because information on whether existing water systems provide safe drinking water is not gathered by the U.S. Census.",
      "DigDeep works with the McDowell Public Service District utility provider to identify residents who need a water hookup and helps secure grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rural development program to extend water trunk lines to hard-to-reach areas. In some cases, the nonprofit helps pay to connect the federally supported water lines directly to people\u2019s homes. It is also helping to install wastewater treatment facilities to more than 400 residents who either have inadequate systems or flush waste into nearby creeks.",
      "The water supply throughout the county is unreliable because of the area\u2019s close historical ties to the rise and fall of the coal economy, said George McGraw, DigDeep\u2019s chief executive.",
      "When coal operations came to McDowell, businesses operated in a \u201cclosed loop\u201d environment. Coal companies paid workers to build and work in the mines, they owned the houses where miners lived, and they built the water lines that served those houses, McGraw said.",
      "When the coal industry began to peter out, companies exited the county, leaving behind an aging system of pipes and drains.",
      "To secure water in the county today, hundreds of people fill plastic jugs from roadside springs or mine shafts, McGraw said. To get drinking water, they may use the bathroom in a store, a neighbor\u2019s house, or a school.",
      "DigDeep has several projects in the planning stages in McDowell. But the Trump USDA budget proposal would chop the rural water program by two-thirds, meaning some public works projects may never get completed. Someone else will have to foot the bill or the system will continue to crumble, leaving many people in McDowell County without a basic necessity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the burden goes away,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThe burden just shifts, and utilities are forced to raise rates on customers, many of whom are below the poverty line.\u201d",

      "In his second term, President Donald Trump has cut a huge range of federal grants that fund social services",
      "Dawn Price signs rent checks worth about $160,000 every month for 79 people that her nonprofit helps house in Laguna Beach, California.",
      "Usually, she logs into an online portal to withdraw enough from an account funded by a grant from the federal housing agency. But in February, she couldn't. Access had been temporarily cut off for many housing organizations as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts and funding freezes.",
      "\u201cThat was just a sea change for us for those dollars to be so immediately at risk,\u201d said Price, the executive director of Friendship Shelter, which started in 1987 as a community organization. Access was eventually restored but the episode took a toll.",
      "\u201cGovernment moves slowly usually, and I think what was so disorienting early on was government was moving really fast,\u201d she said.",
      "In the early days of his second term, President Donald Trump froze, cut or threatened to cut a huge range of social services programs from public safety to early childhood education to food assistance and services for refugee resettlement. Staffing cuts to federal agencies have also contributed to delays and uncertainty around future grant funds. Altogether, his policies are poised to upend decades of partnerships the federal government has built with nonprofits to help people in their communities.",
      "This vast and interconnected set of programs funded by taxpayers has been significantly dismantled in just months, nonprofit leaders, researchers and funders say. And even deeper, permanent cuts are still possible. That uncertainty is also taking a toll on their staff and communities, the leaders said.",
      "In response to questions about the cuts to grant funding, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, \u201cInstead of government largesse that\u2019s often riddled with corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, the Trump administration is focused on unleashing America\u2019s economic resurgence to fuel Americans\u2019 individual generosity.\u201d",
      "He pointed to a new deduction for charitable giving included in the recently passed tax and spending law that he said encourages Americans\u2019 \u201cinnate altruism.\u201d",
      "But experts say private donations will not be enough to meet the needs.",
      "In 2021, $267 billion was granted to nonprofits from all levels of government, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute published in February. While the data includes tax-exempt organizations like local food pantries as well as universities and nonprofit hospitals, it underestimates the total funding that nonprofits receive from the government. It includes grants, but not contracts for services nor reimbursements from programs like Medicare. It also excludes the smallest nonprofits, which file a different, abbreviated tax form.",
      "However, the figure does give a sense of the scale of the historic \u2014 and, until now, solid \u2014 relationship between the public sector and nonprofits over the last 50 years. Now, this system is at risk and leaders like Price say the cost of undoing it will be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "The Urban Institute\u2019s analysis shows more than half of nonprofits in every state received government grants in 2021.",
      "In the vast majority of the country, the typical nonprofit would run a deficit without government funding. Only in two Congressional districts \u2014 one including parts of Orange County, California, and another in the suburbs west of Atlanta \u2014 would a typical nonprofit not be in the red if they lost all of their public grant funding, the analysis found.",
      "But in Orange County, famous for its stunning beaches, mansions and extraordinary wealth, funders, nonprofits and researchers said that finding surprised them. In part, that's because of major economic inequalities in the county and its high cost of living.",
      "Taryn Palumbo, executive director of Orange County Grantmakers, said nonprofits are not as optimistic about their resiliency.",
      "\u201cThey are seeing their budgets getting slashed by 50% or 40%,\u201d she said. \u201cOr they\u2019re having to look to restructure programs that they are running or how they\u2019re serving or the number of people that they\u2019re serving.\u201d",
      "Last year, the local Samueli Foundation commissioned a study of nonprofit needs in part because they were significantly increasing their grantmaking from $18.8 million in 2022 to an estimated $125 million in 2025. They found local nonprofits reported problems maintaining staff, a deep lack of investment in their operations and a dearth of flexible reserve funds.",

      "The foundation responded by opening applications for both unrestricted grants and to support investments in buildings or land. Against this $10 million in potential awards, they received 1,242 applications for more than $250 million, said Lindsey Spindle, the foundation\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cIt tells a really stark picture of how unbelievably deep and broad the need is,\u201d Spindle said. \u201cThere is not a single part of the nonprofit sector that has not responded to these funds. Every topic you can think of: poverty, animal welfare, arts and culture, civil rights, domestic abuse... They\u2019re telling us loud and clear that they are struggling to stay alive.\u201d",
      "One of the founding stories of the United States is the importance of the voluntary sector, of neighbors helping neighbors and of individuals solving social problems. While other liberal democracies built strong welfare states, the U.S. has preferred to look to the charitable sector to provide a substantial part of social services.",
      "Since the 1960s, the federal government has largely funded those social services by giving money to nonprofits, universities, hospitals and companies. Several new policies converged at that time to create this system, including the expansion of the federal income tax during World War II and the codification of tax-exempt charitable organizations in 1954. Then, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations started to fund nonprofits directly with federal money as part of urban renewal and Great Society programs.",
      "\u201cIt was a key approach of midcentury liberalism of addressing issues of poverty, sort of making a reference to civil rights and racial inequality, but not growing the size of government,\u201d said Claire Dunning, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. Conservatives also tended to support working through local, private, nonprofit organizations, though for different reasons than liberals, she said.",
      "With various expansions and cuts during different presidencies, the federal government has continued to fund nonprofits at significant levels, essentially hiding the government in plain sight, Dunning said. The size and importance of the nonprofit apparatus became suddenly visible in January when the Trump administration sought to freeze federal grants and loans.",
      "Dunning said the speed, hostility and scale of the proposed cuts broke with the long legacy of bipartisan support for nonprofits.",
      "\u201cPeople had no idea that the public health information or services they are receiving, their Meals on Wheels program, their afterschool tutoring program, the local park cleanup were actually enabled by public government dollars,\u201d she said.",
      "A coalition of nonprofits challenged the freeze in court in a case that is ongoing, but in the six months since, the administration has cut, paused or discontinued a vast array of programs and grants. The impacts of some of those policy changes have been felt immediately, but many will not hit the ground until current grant funding runs out, which could be in months or years depending on the programs.",
      "Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach has an annual budget of about $15 million, $11.5 million of which comes from government sources. Price said the government funding is \u201cbraided\u201d in complex ways to house and support 330 people. They've already lost a rental reimbursement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the Samueli Foundation stepped in to backfill those lost funds for three years.",
      "That kind of support is extremely unusual, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know of any large-scale private philanthropy response to keeping people housed because it\u2019s a forever commitment,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat person is in housing and is going to need the subsidy for the rest of their lives. These are seriously disabled people with multiple issues that they\u2019re facing that they need help with.\u201d",
      "She also believes that even in a wealthy place like Orange County, private donors are not prepared to give five, six or eight times as much as they do currently. Donors already subsidize their government grants, which she said pay for 69% of the actual program costs.",
      "\u201cWe are providing this service to our government at a loss, at a business loss, and then making up that loss with these Medicaid dollars and also the private fundraising,\u201d she said.",
      "She said her organization has discussed having to put people out of housing back on to the streets if the government funding is cut further.",
      "\u201cThat would be, I think, a signal to me that something is deeply, deeply wrong with how we\u2019re looking at these issues,\u201d said Price, adding, \u201cIf I was placing a bet, I would bet that we have enough good still in government to prevent that.\u201d",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",

Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "An appeals court in Washington turned down The Associated Press' request for immediate reinstatement into covering smaller presidential events like meetings with reporters in the Oval Office and Air Force One",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied an appeal by The Associated Press for a hearing on its efforts to restore full access to cover presidential events, not ending its case but allowing the White House to continue its control over access to President Donald Trump.",
      "The news outlet wanted the court to overturn a three-judge panel's June 6 ruling not to let AP back into the events until merits of the news organization's lawsuit against Trump was decided. But the court on Tuesday declined to hear that appeal.",
      "It all stems from Trump's decision in February to keep AP journalists out of the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events too small for a full press corps, in retaliation for the news outlet's decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico's name.",
      "The AP sued in response. In April, a district court ruled that the administration could not exclude journalists based on their opinions. The Trump administration immediately turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals to successfully delay implementation of the ruling before the court could consider the full merits of the case.",
      "Next up: This fall, the appeals court considers those full merits.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by today's procedural decision but remain focused on the strong district court opinion in support of free speech as we have our case heard,\u201d said Patrick Maks, an AP spokesman. \u201cAs we've said throughout, the press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.",

      "An electrical engineer in rural Vermont is reviving old pay phones to give people a free option for making calls in areas where cell service is unreliable or nonexistent",
      "TUNBRIDGE, Vt. -- An electrical engineer by trade, Patrick Schlott has spent countless hours tinkering with new and old technology. But it wasn\u2019t until he found himself living in rural Vermont that he realized his penchant for repairing old pay phones could provide a public service.",
      "\u201cI realized, wow, there\u2019s no cell service for 10 miles (16 kilometers) in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community could really benefit from something like this.\u201d",
      "Schlott, a full-time engineer at electric airplane manufacturing company BETA Technologies, decided to approach the owners of his local general store with the idea to install old pay phones around town and make them free for public use. After he explained that there would be no cost to the host, North Tunbridge General Store owners Mike and Lois Gross let Schlott install his first phone outside the store.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty surprised, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Is that a real payphone? Does that really work?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t cost any money now,\u2019\" said store owner Mike Gross. \"We\u2019ve had people use it that broke down. It\u2019s a great thing because service is so spotty in Vermont.\u201d",
      "The first free public phone installation was Schlott\u2019s idea, but he says the two other locations, the Latham Library in Thetford and inside an informational booth in Randolph off Interstate 89, came from community members requesting the service.",
      "\u201cAll the other phones so far have been people reaching out, which is pretty cool,\u201d he said.",
      "Schlott buys the old pay phones, which can range in cost from $100-$500, at flea markets, from internet listings or at auction and fixes them up in his basement workshop. All that\u2019s needed to install one of his phones is an internet connection \u2014 no coins necessary.",
      "\u201cBasically, there\u2019s a small piece of equipment that converts an internet telephone line to an analog line that these phones can operate off of,\u201d he said.",

If a user dials zero, the phone will ring Schlott's personal cellphone, though he uses an app to keep his number private.",
      "So far, the phone at the Latham Library location has seen the most use. According to Schlott, 370 calls have been made since the phone was installed five months ago, filling a need for students without cellphones to call their parents for after-school pickups.",
      "Hannah McClain is a regular at the North Tunbridge General Store and says she finds comfort in knowing the phone is there whenever her 16-year-old daughters might need it.",
      "\u201cIt does make me feel safer if the kids are out and about, that if they had an emergency up this way that they could stop and use this. I think these are a great service,\u201d she said.",
      "Schlott is seeing increased interest in the service, with another free phone install in the works at the Brownell Library in Essex. For now, he plans to continue covering the costs associated with each phone, but noted that may change as the project scales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see something retro that has that old-school appeal but also works. To actually hear it ring, to pick it up and have a dial tone, I think there\u2019s real power in that,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t think they should end up in a landfill. They should be recycled and put to good use.\u201d",

      "Sanseito, which translates to \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d started in 2020 when Kamiya gathered people on YouTube and social media to create a political group to attract voters discontent with conventional parties.",
      "The group began to grow as its members started winning seats in local assemblies, stepping up its presence and grassroots support base.",
      "After the start of the coronavirus pandemic, his online approach quickly got traction, fueled partly by an anti-vaccine stance.",
      "Sanseito achieved a foothold in national politics in 2022 when Kamiya won a six-year term in the upper house. The party won three seats in the October election in the lower house.",

The one-time treatment was initially approved for boys age 4 and younger who could still walk. Last year, FDA expanded approval to older patients who are no longer able to walk.",
      "The therapy was already under FDA scrutiny after two teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury, a known side effect of the treatment. Then the company last week disclosed a third death with a different therapy: a 51-year-old patient who was enrolled in a company trial for another form of muscular dystrophy.",

      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",

      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",

      "Ukraine \u2019s parliament passed legislation that will tighten oversight of two key anti-corruption agencies, which critics say could significantly weaken their independence and give President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s circle greater sway over investigations. Zelenskyy signed the bill into law, according to the parliament's website late Tuesday.",
      "Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union and maintain access to billions of dollars in Western aid. The legislation's passage has triggered public outrage in Ukraine, with some saying it appeared to be a greater moral blow than the routine Russian drone and missile attacks.",

      "While rallies have taken place during the war in Ukraine, they have largely focused on the return of prisoners of war or missing people. Protests, however, remain a traditional form of public pressure in Ukraine, where two previous revolutions were victorious for the public.",
      "\u201cCorruption is a problem in any country, and it must always be fought,\u201d said Ihor Lachenkov, a blogger and activist who urged people to join the protest through his social media platforms, which reach more than 1.5 million followers.",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has vowed to remain in power to oversee the implementation of a new Japan-U.S. tariff agreement",
      "TOKYO -- Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Wednesday vowed to remain in power to oversee the implementation of a new Japan-U.S. tariff agreement, despite media speculation and growing calls for him to resign after a historic defeat of his governing party.",
      "Ishiba met with heavyweights from his Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and former Prime Ministers Taro Aso, Fumio Kishida and Yoshihide Suga at party headquarters.",
      "He told reporters afterward that they didn't discuss his resignation or a new party leadership contest, but only the election results, voters\u2019 dissatisfaction and the urgent need to avoid party discord.",
      "Despite his business-as-usual demeanor, Ishiba is under increasing pressure to bow out after the LDP and junior coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in Sunday's election in the 248-member upper house, the smaller and less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament, shaking his grip on power.",
      "It came after a loss in the more powerful lower house in October, and so his coalition now lacks a majority in both houses of parliament, making it even more difficult for his government to pass policies and worsening Japan's political instability.",
      "Ishiba says he intends to stay on to tackle pressing challenges, including tariff talks with the U.S., so as not to create a political vacuum despite calls from inside and outside his party for a quick resignation.",
      "Ishiba \u201ckeeps saying he is staying on. What was the public's verdict in the election all about?\" said Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the surging Democratic Party for the People, or DPP.",
      "At the LDP, a group of younger lawmakers led by Yasutaka Nakasone started a petition drive seeking Ishiba's early resignation and renewal of party leadership.",
      "\u201cWe all have a sense of crisis and think the election results were ultimatum from the voters,\u201d he said.",
      "Japanese media reported that Ishiba is expected to soon announce plans to step down in August.",
      "The conservative Yomiuri newspaper said in an extra edition on Wednesday that Ishiba had decided to announce his resignation by the end of July after receiving a detailed report from his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, on the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy, paving the way for a new party leader.",
      "Ishiba denied the report and said that he wants to focus on the U.S. trade deal, which covers more than 4,000 goods affecting many Japanese producers and industries. He welcomed the new agreement, which places tariffs at 15% on Japanese cars and other goods imported into the U.S. from Japan, down from the initial 25%.",

      "In Sunday's election, voters frustrated with price increases exceeding the pace of wage hikes, especially younger people who have long felt ignored by the ruling government's focus on senior voters, rapidly turned to the emerging conservative DPP and right-wing populist Sanseito party.",

      "People expressed mixed reaction to Ishiba, as his days seem to be numbered.",
      "Kentaro Nakamura, 53, said that he thought it's time for Ishiba to go, because he lacked consistency and did poorly in the election.",
      "\u201cThe (election) result was so bad and I thought it would not be appropriate for him to stay on,\" Nakamura said. \"I thought it was just a matter of time.\u201d",
      "But Isamu Kawana, a Tokyo resident in his 70s, was more sympathetic and said if it wasn't Ishiba who was elected prime minister last year, the result would have been the same.",

      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",

      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "\u201cAnything that is difficult, AI can make easy. But that is a problem,\u201d says Nair. \u201cActively seek out challenges, whether academic or personal.

      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister\u2019s birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI\u2019s potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\u201cAI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It\u2019s never judgmental,\u201d says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to AI, you are always right. You\u2019re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\u201d",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d said Robb. \u201cWhen we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\u201d The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\u201cIf teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else\u2019s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\u201d he said.",

In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",

      "An artificial intelligence agenda that started coalescing on the podcasts of Silicon Valley billionaires is now being forged into U.S. policy as President Donald Trump leans on the ideas of the tech figures who backed his election campaign.",
      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",

      "The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday\u2019s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It might also include some of the AI culture war preoccupations of the circle of venture capitalists who endorsed Trump last year.",

      "\u201cThe AI\u2019s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it\u2019s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,\u201d Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the \u201cBlack George Washington\u201d moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.",
      "The administration\u2019s latest push against \u201cwoke AI\u201d comes a week after the Pentagon announced new $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google, to address \u201ccritical national security challenges.\u201d",
      "Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk\u2019s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d companies.

      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",

      "Russian lawmakers have approved a bill that punishes online searches for information that is deemed \u201cextremist,\u201d the latest move by government authorities in their relentless crackdown on dissent",
      "MOSCOW -- Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill that punishes online searches for information that is deemed \u201cextremist,\u201d the latest move by government authorities in their relentless crackdown on dissent.",
      "The bill passed by the lower house, the State Duma, moves to its all-but-certain endorsement in the upper house and then goes to President Vladimir Putin to be signed into law.",
      "The legislation punishes what it describes as \u201cdeliberately searching for and accessing extremist materials\u201d online. First-time offenders face a fine of up to the equivalent of $64.",
      "The official definition of extremist activity is extremely broad and includes opposition groups like the Anti-Corruption Foundation, created by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and the \u201cinternational LGBT movement.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how authorities will track down violators. Officials and lawmakers said ordinary internet users won't be affected and only those who methodically seek outlawed content will be targeted. They didn't explain how the authorities would differentiate between them.",
      "Some observers have suggested the information would likely come from internet providers or social media platforms, and police also could randomly check the search history of cellphones or computers.",
      "The new legislation also contained a ban on advertising of virtual private network services and fines for VPN resources that fail to comply with government regulations, but stopped short of banning their use. It did list the use of a VPN as an \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d in case of other violations of the law.",
      "Russians widely use VPN services for access to banned content, but authorities have sought to tighten restrictions, trying to close the loopholes. The state communications watchdog has increasingly used technology to analyze traffic and block specific VPN protocols.",
      "The Russian authorities have ramped their multipronged crackdown on dissent after sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",

A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",

Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",

      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",

      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",

      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",

      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",

      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",

      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group.

      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

It is too ingrained in everything we do,\u201d says Nair, who is trying to step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships in his high school. \u201cThe best way you can try to regulate it is to embrace being challenged.\u201d",

If you fall for the idea that easier is better, then you are the most vulnerable to being absorbed into this newly artificial world.\u201d",

      "Far beyond Harvard University and its standoff with the Trump administration, Republican officials in several states have been pushing for changes at public universities",
      "Ken Beckley never went to Harvard, but he has been wearing a crimson Harvard cap in a show of solidarity. As he sees it, the Trump administration's attacks on the school echo a case of government overreach at his own alma mater, Indiana University.",
      "Beckley, a former head of the school's alumni association, rallied fellow graduates this spring in an unsuccessful effort to stop Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, from removing three alumni-elected members from Indiana University\u2019s Board of Trustees and handpicking their replacements.",
      "No government effort to influence a university \u2014 private or public \u2014 has gotten more attention than the clash at Harvard, where the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding as it seeks a series of policy changes. But far beyond the Ivy League, Republican officials are targeting public universities in several states with efforts seeking similar ends.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happened nationally is now affecting Indiana,\u201d said Beckley, who bought Harvard caps in bulk and passes them out to friends.",
      "Officials in conservative states took aim at higher education before President Donald Trump began his second term, driven in part by the belief that colleges are out of touch \u2014 too liberal and loading up students with too much debt. The first efforts focused on critical race theory, an academic framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation\u2019s institutions, and then on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Since Trump took office, officials in states including Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Iowa and Idaho increasingly have focused on university governance \u2014 rules for who picks university presidents and boards and how much control they exert over curriculums and faculty tenure.",
      "As at Harvard, which Trump has decried as overly influenced by liberal thinking, those state officials have sought to reduce the power of faculty members and students.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve realized that they can take a bit of a step further, that they can advance their policy priorities through those levers they have through the state university system,\u201d said Preston Cooper, a senior fellow who studies higher education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.",
      "In Indiana, Braun said he picked new trustees who will guide the school \u201cback in the right direction.\u201d They include an anti-abortion attorney and a former ESPN host who was disciplined because she criticized the company's policy requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "Braun's administration has ramped up scrutiny of hiring practices at colleges statewide. Indiana's attorney general, Todd Rokita, has sent letters to the University of Notre Dame, Butler University and DePauw University questioning the legality of their DEI programs.",
      "Butler, a private, liberal arts school in Indianapolis, was founded by an abolitionist in the decade leading up to the Civil War and admitted women and students of color from the start.",
      "\u201cI hope that Butler will uphold the standards they were founded on,\u201d said Edyn Curry, president of Butler\u2019s Black Student Union.",
      "In Florida, the state university system board in June rejected longtime academic Santa Ono for the presidency at the University of Florida, despite a unanimous vote of approval by the school's own Board of Trustees. The unprecedented reversal followed criticism from conservatives about Ono's past support for DEI programs.",
      "That followed the conservative makeover of New College of Florida, a small liberal arts school once known as the state\u2019s most progressive. After Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed a group of conservatives to its governing board, many faculty left, including Amy Reid, who now manages a team focused on higher education at the free-expression group PEN America.",
      "\u201cWhen our students started organizing at New College, one of their slogans was \u2018Your Campus is Next,\u2019\u201d said Reid, who saw the gender studies program she directed defunded and then cut. \u201cSo no, we\u2019re not surprised when you see other states redefining what can be in a general education class, because we\u2019ve seen it happen already.\u201d",
      "The changes at several public universities are proceeding without battles of the kind seen at Harvard. In a standoff seen widely as a test of private universities' independence, Harvard has filed lawsuits against the administration's moves to cut its federal funding and block its ability to host international students.",

Now, there's a perceived sense that faculty should not be solely responsible for academic matters and that the trustees should play a more active role, said Joseph Yockey, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law and the former president of Iowa\u2019s faculty senate.",

The task force includes officers who work for federal Homeland Security Investigations, which can enforce immigration laws, the lawsuit said.",
      "After federal immigration officers told him in the chat that the student did not have a criminal history but had an expired visa, Zwinck allegedly provided them with their location and told her to wait with him in his patrol car for about five minutes, asking about her accent and where she was born.

      "WASHINGTON -- People with congestive heart failure, undergoing treatment for schizophrenia or who have a history of paraphilic disorders will no longer be eligible for a medical waiver to serve in the military, according to new rules issued by the Pentagon on Tuesday.",
      "The guidance signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth updates a list of conditions that disqualify potential recruits from serving in the armed forces. The decision comes after the Pentagon announced earlier this year that it would ban transgender troops and review other medical conditions that are currently eligible for a waiver.",
      "\"America\u2019s warfighters must be physically and mentally capable of performing their duties in the harshest of conditions,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo announcing the changes. \u201cSevere underlying medical conditions introduce significant risks on the battlefield and threaten not only mission priorities, but also the health and safety of the affected individual and their fellow service members.\u201d",
      "Waivers have long been used to enlist young people who might otherwise be unqualified for military service due to a wide array of medical, conduct or other reasons.",
      "Most waivers are issued for medical conditions ranging from asthma, eyesight problems or skin disorders to more complex health conditions, such as past psychological illness or previous sports injuries that may have healed but still must be evaluated.",
      "Prior to the new rules, heart failure, current treatment for schizophrenia and a history of paraphilic disorders \u2014 defined as a persistent sexual interest in atypical objects or activities \u2014 were among a long list of physical and mental health conditions in which waivers were allowed.",

Those conditions include a missing eye, hand or foot, past corneal transplants, liver failure, kidney disease, past psychotic disorders or the presence of an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2019 administration has already signed contracts to pay at least $245 million to set up and run the new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\" according to a public database.",
      "The amount \u2014 to be fronted by Florida taxpayers \u2014 is in line with the $450 million a year officials have estimated the facility will cost.",
      "It's also a reminder of the public funding that DeSantis' Republican administration is spending to help carry out President Donald Trump 's mass deportation agenda.",
      "Human rights advocates, faith leaders and environmentalists have condemned the detention center. So has Mark Morgan, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first term. Morgan wrote an opinion piece published by Fox News criticizing the facility as \u201cbuilt for headlines\u201d and \u201cripe for failure, mismanagement and corruption.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look by the numbers.",
      "A state database of government contracts shows that since Florida officials announced plans for the facility on June 19, the Executive Office of the Governor has awarded at least two dozen contracts totaling more than $245 million in taxpayer funds to build and manage the facility. It rose in a matter of days from a county-owned airstrip surrounded by swampland about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami.",
      "All the contracts were awarded under an executive order declaring an illegal immigration emergency the governor first enacted in 2023 and which he has renewed since then. The order grants the state sweeping authority to suspend \u201cany statute, rule or order\u201d seen as slowing the response to the emergency, including requirements to competitively bid public contracts.",
      "State officials say at least some of the cost will be covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is best known for responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters. But in court documents filed earlier this month, attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security stated that the federal government had yet to reimburse Florida for any of the costs. The department made clear that \u201cFlorida is constructing and operating the facility using state funds on state lands under state emergency authority.\u201d",
      "The single largest state contract related to the facility is a $78.5 million deal with Critical Response Strategies, a Jacksonville-based consulting firm. The responsibilities covered include hiring a warden, camp managers, corrections officers and IT workers.",
      "Other major contractor include Longview Solutions Group, which is being paid $25.6 million for site preparation, civil engineering, road construction and fence installation. Doodie Calls, a St. Petersburg-based supplier of portable toilets and shower trailers, was awarded a $22 million contract.",
      "The firm Gothams landed a $21.1 million contract to provide IT services, access badges and wristbands for detainees, while SLSCO LTD and Garner Environmental Services were both awarded $19.7 million deals to build out the site and handle ongoing maintenance.",

      "Corrections officers at the facility can expect to earn up to $11,600 a month, plus overtime, according to a job posting for the company on LinkedIn. The starting pay for Florida\u2019s rank-and-file corrections officers is $22 an hour or about $3,800 a month at the state's brick-and-mortar prisons, which have been so persistently understaffed that DeSantis deployed members of the Florida National Guard to work at them for more than two years.",
      "As journalists and watchdogs have raised questions about the contracts and companies behind them, documents detailing deliverables and line-item spending have disappeared from the state's website. They've been replaced with one-page invoices that show little more than the names of the companies, how much they're charging, the dates on which each deal was signed and an address for where to send the bill.",
      "Some multimillion dollar contracts were awarded to political donors who have given to campaigns supporting DeSantis and other Republicans.",
      "The governor's office directed questions about the contracts to the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the state agency in charge of building the detention center.

      "Walsh said state and federal courts have long upheld the legality of the death penalty. In Pennsylvania, only three people have been executed since the 1970s, and all had given up on their appeals. Appeals and natural deaths have shrunk Pennsylvania's death row from well over 200 two decades ago to 94 inmates currently.",

      "The U.S. Air Force says air traffic controllers at Minot International Airport in North Dakota failed to warn a military B-52 bomber crew about a nearby commercial plane",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Air traffic controllers at a small North Dakota airport didn't inform an Air Force bomber's crew that a commercial airliner was flying in the same area, the military said, shedding light on the nation's latest air safety scare.",
      "A SkyWest pilot performed a sharp turn, startling passengers, to avoid colliding with the B-52 bomber that he said was in his flight path as he prepared to land Friday at Minot International Airport.",
      "The bomber had been conducting a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair in Minot that was approved in consultation with the Federal Aviation Administration, the Minot International Airport air traffic control and the Minot Air Force Base's air traffic control team, the Air Force said in a statement Monday.",
      "As the bomber headed to the fairgrounds shortly before 8 p.m., the base's air traffic control advised its crew to contact the Minot airport's air traffic control.",
      "\u201cThe B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) westbound after the flyover,\u201d the Air Force said. \u201cThe tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft.\u201d",
      "Video taken by a passenger on Delta Flight 3788, which departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, and posted to social media captured audio of the SkyWest pilot explaining over the plane's intercom that he made the hard bank after spotting the bomber in the flight path that Minot air traffic control had directed him to take for landing.",
      "\u201cSorry about the aggressive maneuver. It caught me by surprise,\u201d the pilot can be heard saying on the video. \u201cThis is not normal at all. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t give us a heads up.\u201d",

In fact, the vast majority of the nation\u2019s airports don\u2019t even have towers, mainly because most small airports don\u2019t have passenger air service. But regional FAA radar facilities do oversee traffic all across the country and help direct planes in and out of airports like Minot.

    "story": [
      "The United Nations reports a global shift toward renewable energy, calling it a \"positive tipping point.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- The global switch to renewable energy has passed a \u201cpositive tipping point\u201d where solar and wind power will become even cheaper and more widespread, according to two United Nations reports released Tuesday, describing a bright spot amid otherwise gloomy progress to curb climate change.",
      "Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the U.N.\u2019s multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5% of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024.",
      "The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "\u201cThe fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. \u201cWe are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust follow the money,\u201d Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was $2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels.",
      "Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough.",
      "The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China \u2014 where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy \u2014 as well as countries such as India and Brazil.",
      "Yet Africa represented less than 2% of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.",
      "\u201cThe Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts,\u201d said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable.",
      "The U.N. reports are \u201cright on the money,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn't part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable.",
      "And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $620 billion, compared to $70 billion for renewables, the U.N. report said.",

      "But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that's because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centers and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world.",
      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030 data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",
      "So Guterres called on the world's major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030.",
      "In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3% per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration has withdrawn the nation from the landmark Paris climate accord and cut many federal renewable energy programs, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.",
      "Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically.",
      "\u201cCountries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets,\u201d Guterres said.",
      "Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, \u201cthere are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.\u201d",

      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",

      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",

    "summary": "He opened such popular NYC institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led to a suicide attempt two years later. He has now penned an irreverent memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land. An immediate sensation, it established certain McNally \"musts,\" such as the importance of having a hamburger on the menu. \"I don't like hamburgers much myself,\" he said. \"But it's a sign of snobbery not to have a hamburgers.\"",
      "McNally prides himself on putting his staff above even his diners. Some of his employees have been with him for over 30 years. And ever since returning to work post-stroke, McNally has come to appreciate how they feel about him. \"I had to talk to my staff and was really nervous,\" he said. \"They were really kind. In the end, kindness is really essential.\"",
      "I asked, \"The stroke lifted the veil on what they thought of you?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah,\" McNally laughed. \"They made me feel good.\"",

    "summary": "Connie Francis was a wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "PepsiCo is introducing a new prebiotic soda this fall geared toward health-conscious customers.",
      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

      "The Hershey Company on Tuesday confirmed media reports it is raising candy prices as it battles rising cocoa costs.",
      "The price change will be a \"low double-digit increase\" and affect products across the company's confection portfolio, according to a Hershey spokesperson. Founded in 1894, the Pennsylvania-based company owns over 90\u00a0brands including Hershey Kisses, KitKat, Reese's and York.",
      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",
      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",
      "Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years due to a global cocoa shortage. The cost for the commodity was $8,402 in June, a 73% increase from five years ago, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks food prices.",
      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain. As a result, replanting rates of diseased trees are low and West African yields have been more subject to weather impacts,\" Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities strategist at J.P. Morgan, said in the article.",
      "In a May earnings call, Michele Buck, president of The Hershey Company, said the candy company would lean into products that are \"less Cocoa intensive\" as it navigates the inflation of cocoa prices. This is part of the company's vision to become a \"snacking powerhouse\" Buck said.",
      "\"We love our chocolate business and we want to continue to grow that,\" Buck said. \"But we also know that if we get into white spaces like sweets, better-for-you and salty, it adds incremental consumers and occasions,\" she added.",

      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away.

      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:23:57 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The perennial debut of the Pumpkin Spice Latte may not be enough on its own to turn around the fate of Starbucks. But if past years are any indication, it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and revenue booster.",
      "What is on Starbucks' new 2025 fall menu?",
      "Starbucks said several other fall-inspired drinks will be returning to its menu, including the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and the Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte.",
      "The chain is also adding a new fall drink, called the Pecan Oatmilk Cortado, with Leiberman describing it as combining \"fall flavors with our bold espresso.\" Starbucks is also adding a fall menu item, Italian Sausage Egg Bites.",
      "The rollout of the new fall menu comes amid CEO Brian Niccol's\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\" campaign, which he rolled out in September of last year to increase foot traffic in the chain's stores and revive sales.",
      "The rise of PSL",
      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",
      "Mentions of pumpkin spice on U.S. menus climbed nearly 34% from 2014 to 2024, according to Technomic, which tracks consumer and menu trends.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:52:53 -0400",
    "summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans fear Social Security won't provide enough to live on when they retire, AARP study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

      "\"We can confirm that a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employee, while traveling to China in a personal capacity, was made subject to an exit ban in China,\" the State Department spokesperson said Monday. \"We are tracking this case very closely and are engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\"",
      "The New York Times reported Monday that the employee in question is a U.S. citizen who has been prevented from leaving China since mid-April. The newspaper cited a State Department document it has obtained, adding that it shows Beijing officials seized the man's passport, credit card, cellphone and iPad while he was in the city of Chengdu on April 14.",
      "The Times said, citing the document, that the man's documents were returned on April 22, but that he was told he could not leave the country.",
      "At a news conference on Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the case of the Department of Commerce employee beyond saying that Beijing \"upholds the rule of law and handles entry and exit affairs in accordance with the law.\"",

      "U.S. citizens may only realize they have been subjected to an exit ban when they attempt to leave China, and there may be no available legal recourse to appeal such a ban via a Chinese court, according to the State Department's travel advisory.",
      "The Chinese government also does not recognize dual nationality, meaning \"U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment,\" the guidance on the State Department's website says.",
      "The latest incidents come at a sensitive time in relations between Beijing and Washington. In late June, the White House and officials in Beijing said the two sides had\u00a0agreed on the framework of a new deal\u00a0to end a trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "As it stands, China faces an August 12 deadline \u2014 imposed by President Trump \u2014 to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. to end an escalating tit-for-tat trade tariff war that the countries have engaged in since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of up to 145% on imports from China, and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, but the two sides agreed to a truce to allow for negotiations. In the meantime, the Trump administration has imposed 30% tariffs on imports from China, pending the August 12 deadline, when much higher rates will be imposed by both Washington and Beijing if no agreement is reached.",
      "The standoff has increased the risks for American companies doing business in China that had already been mounting for several years.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri.

      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools.

      "A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors out of over $300 million over the past six years.",
      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",
      "Previously, Hunsicker was also the COO and president of Right Media, an online advertising startup that sold to Yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the COO of Drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by Facebook.",

      "Juneau, Alaska \u2014 A small plane that crashed in 2023 while carrying moose meat for hunters in remote western Alaska, killing the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, was overweight for takeoff and encountered drag from a set of antlers mounted outside, federal investigators said in a report released Tuesday.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board, in its final report on the crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., who was the only person on board the aircraft, listed several factors among its probable cause findings. They included decisions by Peltola to fly the plane above its maximum takeoff weight and affix a set of moose antlers on the right wing strut that caused a drag, along with turbulent flight conditions in the area.",
      "Downdrafts, \"along with the overweight airplane and the added drag and lateral weight imbalance caused by the antlers on the right wing, would likely have resulted in the airplane having insufficient power and/or control authority to maneuver above terrain,\" the report states.",
      "\"Number one was, obviously, the overweight condition \u2014 no ifs, ands, or buts there,\" CBS Anchorage affiliate KYES-TV quotes NTSB Alaska Region Chief Clint Johnson as saying. \"The parasitic drag from the antlers that were attached to the right wing, and then also the last thing would be the wind, the mechanical wind turbulence at the end of the takeoff area, which unfortunately, led to this accident.",
      "\"If you would have been able to take one of those items out, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. But those things all in combination led to this tragic accident.\"",
      "The Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub crashed Sept. 12, 2023, northeast of the small western Alaska community of St. Mary's. Peltola had days earlier taken five hunters, a guide and equipment from the community of Holy Cross to an airstrip at St. Mary's. The group set up camp next to the runway, which was near hilly terrain and about 70 miles northwest of Holy Cross, the agency said.",
      "The day before the crash, the group got a moose and made plans with Peltola, via satellite messaging devices, for him to transport the meat, the NTSB said. On the day of the crash, Peltola had already picked up a load of meat and had returned for another. He didn't use scales to weigh the cargo, the agency said.",
      "\"The meat was strapped into the rear passenger seat area with both the seatbelt and rope and was loaded into the airplane's belly pod, which did not have tie-down provisions,\" a September 2023 NTSB preliminary report on the crash\u00a0said.",
      "The NTSB found about 150 pounds of the meat in the forward section of the belly pod after the crash, the report said. One of the hunters said Peltola Jr. told him he would be running on reserve fuel by the time he arrived back at Holy Cross.",
      "Two hunters were at the site when the crash occurred and provided aid to Peltola, the agency previously reported. Peltola died of his injuries within about two hours, the agency said.",

      "Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe this week for meetings on a wide range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and will continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal, according to a U.S. official.",
      "In a briefing with reporters Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce suggested Witkoff could soon go to the Middle East, but declined to provide details about his itinerary.",
      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing, according to an Israeli official, and the Israeli government expects to soon receive Hamas' response to an offer made last week.",
      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",

      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",
      "The letters have \"gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" Lutnick said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling the federations overseeing swimming, athletics and other sports it has an \"obligation to comply\" with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0issued by President Trump.",
      "The new policy, announced Monday with\u00a0a quiet change on the USOPC's website\u00a0and confirmed in a letter sent to national sport governing bodies, follows a similar step taken by the NCAA earlier this year.",
      "The USOPC change is noted obliquely as a detail under \"USOPC Athlete Safety Policy\" and references Mr. Trump's executive order, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" signed in February. That order, among other things, threatens to \"rescind all funds\" from organizations that allow transgender athlete participation in women's sports.",
      "U.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that \"the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials\" since Mr. Trump signed the order.",
      "\"As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. \"Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.\"",
      "At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, just one openly transgender U.S. athlete competed. Nikki Hiltz, a middle-distance runner from California who uses they/them pronouns, was assigned female at birth. It's unclear how the change announced by USOPC would impact Hiltz.",
      "At a\u00a0USOPC meeting in April, Hirshland said that the committee had no plans to define eligibility criteria ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\"So typically speaking at an international level, the international federations will define eligibility criteria for the events in which they own jurisdiction, world Cups, world Championships, et cetera, and the national governing bodies domestically would define eligibility criteria for their events,\" Hirshland said at the time. \"In some cases those may be elite level events, national championships and things. In other cases those may be lower level grassroots youth sport competitions and things of that nature. So we do not have, nor will we have an eligibility policy, it wouldn't be appropriate, it's not our role to take on that position.\"",
      "The National Women's Law Center put out a statement condemning the move.",
      "\"By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,\" said that organization's president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.",
      "The USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs.",
      "Some of those organizations \u2014 for instance, USA Track and Field \u2014 have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Mr. Trump's order.",
      "A USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC's change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only \"athletes who are of the female sex\" in women's competition and opening men's events to \"all athletes not eligible for the women's category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.\"",
      "The nationwide battle over transgender athletes on girls' and women's sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court by those who say the policies are discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear a case over whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Also earlier this month, the Justice Department\u00a0filed a civil lawsuit against California's Department of Education and a nongovernmental sports organization alleging that they violated federal civil rights laws, including Title IX, by implementing policies that \"force girls to compete against boys\" in state athletic events.",
      "The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Mr. Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "Earlier this month, the University of Pennsylvania said it would ban transgender women from participating in its women's sports teams as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school for allowing\u00a0Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, to compete for\u00a0its women's swimming team in 2021 and 2022.",
      "Female eligibility is a key issue for the International Olympic Committee\u00a0under its new president, Kirsty Coventry, who has signaled an effort to \"protect the female category.\" The IOC has allowed individual sports federations to set their own rules at the Olympics \u2014 and some have already taken steps on the topic.",
      "Stricter rules on transgender athletes \u2014 barring from women's events anyone who went through male puberty \u2014 have been passed by swimming, cycling and track and field. Soccer is reviewing its eligibility rules for women and could set limits on testosterone.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he wants the IOC to change everything \"having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.\"",
      "As he took office earlier this year, the president signed an executive order declaring that it is the policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female.\" Mr. Trump campaigned on the issue and spent tens of millions of dollars on political ads that focused on transgender rights.",

      "House Republicans on Tuesday advanced a measure that would rename the Kennedy Center for the Performing\u00a0Arts' opera house after first lady Melania Trump \u2014 as President Trump and his allies boost their influence over the D.C. cultural institution.",
      "The proposed renaming was folded into an amendment to a bill that would set fiscal year 2026 funding levels for the Interior Department and several other federal agencies, including the Kennedy Center. The amendment \u2014 and the bill itself \u2014 were advanced by the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing Tuesday.",

      "The renaming was not requested by the Trump administration, Simpson's communications director Lexi Hamel told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"Naming a theater after her is an excellent way to recognize her appreciation for the arts,\" Simpson, who chairs the Appropriations Committee's Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee, wrote in a statement.",

      "The nameplate over the opera house \u2014 which seats nearly 2,400 people and is one of several spaces in the Kennedy Center \u2014 is unlikely to change any time soon. Spending bills like the one advanced Tuesday generally need 60 votes to pass the Senate, meaning even if it makes it through the full House intact, several Senate Democrats will need to vote for it.

    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, said Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell \"in the coming days\" about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media. He added that he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "On Capitol Hill, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee approved a motion from GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee that directs the committee's chairman to subpoena Maxwell to appear for a deposition, a signal of lawmakers' interest in speaking to Epstein's former partner.",
      "Blanche, who was President Trump's private defense attorney before joining the Justice Department, said that the department and the FBI continue to stand by a memo released earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI also said they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and noted that the review did not uncover evidence that would prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,\" Blanche said in a second statement shared by Bondi. \"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general said the Justice Department in prior administrations had not asked about her willingness to meet with the government, and he anticipates \"meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.\"",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said in a statement, \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know about Blanche's bid to speak with Maxwell but said it \"sounds appropriate to do.\"",
      "\"It's sort of a witch hunt,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Just a continuation of the witch hunt.\"",
      "Maxwell was an associate of Epstein's and convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeal of her conviction.",
      "Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyers comes after the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York on Friday to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving Epstein. He was indicted in 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He died by suicide while in federal custody before his trial. Epstein had been arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "In addition to asking the court to release the grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's indictment, the Justice Department also asked it to make public grand jury transcripts associated with Maxwell's case. U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer and Richard Berman, who are handling Maxwell and Epstein's cases, respectively, each\u00a0ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its request to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "Whether the transcripts become public will be up to the judges overseeing the cases, though the records will likely be heavily redacted to shield information related to victims. If the Justice Department's requests are granted by the court, the material is unlikely to be available immediately, and it could be weeks or months before it is unsealed.",
      "Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "The president and his administration have been dealing with backlash from Mr. Trump's allies that arose after the Justice Department released the memo about Epstein.",
      "Some top administration officials, such as Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, suggested before Mr. Trump's reelection that Democrats were deliberately concealing information about Epstein and his purported list of clients. But now, with the Justice Department under Mr. Trump's control, some of his allies are skeptical of its claim that there is nothing left to disclose.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to downplay the focus on Epstein and lashed out at some of his supporters, calling them \"weaklings\" who have been fooled by Democrats. He referred to claims about Epstein as the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were friends for years, until they had a falling out around 2004. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein in Palm Beach, but said in 2019 following Epstein's arrest that they haven't spoken in 15 years.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump had signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher, parent company News Corporation, its leader Rupert Murdoch and the reporters who wrote the Epstein story. Mr. Trump is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:12:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard released a memorandum and files regarding the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions during the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "The release of more than 100 pages of declassified files and a memorandum by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited political battles over Russia's actions during the 2016 presidential election, a topic that has long incensed President Trump and put the actions of the U.S. intelligence community in partisan crosshairs.",
      "Gabbard's office on Friday alleged in the memorandum, which accompanied the files, that they contained what she called evidence of \"suppression\" and manipulation of the intelligence underlying a 2017 community-wide assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The files include email exchanges, excerpts from a President's Daily Brief and a readout from a principals committee meeting, chiefly from a period during the Obama administration.",
      "In a statement and social media posts, Gabbard claimed the materials, which were marked declassified on July 17, 2025, were evidence of a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and \"years-long coup\" plotted by Obama administration officials against Mr. Trump, and said she would forward them to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal referral. She also said in subsequent media appearances that more declassifications about the matter would be made.",
      "Democrats fiercely disputed her claims, pointing to the findings of a bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. They accused Gabbard herself of misrepresenting intelligence findings and processes.",
      "\"What you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt,\" said Congressman Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"[T]he intelligence community is full of very good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest,\" Himes said.",
      "\"This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.",
      "The memorandum released by Gabbard appears to conflate different kinds of Russian operations during the 2016 election cycle while alleging Obama administration officials fabricated a narrative designed to undermine Mr. Trump. It points several times to select phrases in the documents that say Russia lacked the intent or the capability to use cyber operations to target U.S. election infrastructure, change vote tallies, and overturn the election \u2014 which previous investigations agreed did not happen.",
      "But while no evidence emerged to indicate Russia engaged in a vote-switching cyberattack, there was evidence that showed a multi-pronged Kremlin influence campaign that attempted to sway American voters. That influence campaign included hack-and-leak operations and social media posts designed to undermine the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and bolster then-candidate Trump's, according to the intelligence community's assessment.",
      "In the years after the 2016 presidential election, multiple reviews of the intelligence community's findings \u2014 including the Senate report and an investigation led by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 reinforced its conclusions.",
      "A CIA review of the tradecraft involved in the agency's assessment released earlier this month found some of its judgments may have been rushed and the confidence levels attached to one of them may have been too high, but it did not change the conclusion that Russia's efforts were designed to benefit Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement Tuesday: \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "\"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,\" Rodenbush wrote.",
      "Gabbard's statements on Friday were praised and recirculated multiple times by the president, senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton wrote in a social media post, \"It will take decades for the Intelligence Community to recover from the damage done during the Obama and Biden presidencies.\"",
      "Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote that Gabbard had \"exposed the startling depths of a seditious coup against the Republic.\"",
      "The memorandum also criticizes leaks from what it terms \"IC officials\" or \"Deep State officials in the IC\" \u2014 with \"IC\" referring to the intelligence community \u2014 to media outlets at the time the assessments were being drafted that said Russia had intervened in the election in an effort to help President Trump. The memo does not, however, identify these individuals or provide other evidence about the origin of those disclosures.",
      "It also highlights instances in which certain agencies disputed or pushed to change language included in evolving intelligence assessments of Russia's cyber activity. For instance, it cites an FBI official who suggested in an exchange in September of 2016 that language about Russia's intent to use cyber attacks to disrupt the 2016 election be \"softened.\"",
      "\"[W]e would prefer for the first sentence regarding Russia's intent to be softened,\" the official wrote. \"The way it currently reads, it would indicate that we have definitive information that Russia does intend to disrupt our elections and we are uncomfortable making that assessment at this point.\"",
      "Dissents from different agencies are common and conclusions can change as more intelligence is collected or analysis is done, according to current and former officials familiar with the drafting process for intelligence assessments. It is not clear from the redacted selection of emails released by Gabbard how the language flagged by the FBI was finalized.",
      "Warner has expressed concerns about the effect of Gabbard's recent actions on intelligence sharing by partners of the United States, noting that representatives of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the Five Eyes \u2014 which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2014 had approached him for answers.",
      "\"I have had Five Eye partners say, 'Warner, what the hell is going on?'\" Warner said during a panel discussion at last week's Aspen Security forum, hours before the 2016 files were released. \"I do believe our Five Eyes partners and others are not sharing as much information as they would.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal government on Monday released thousands of records on the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 a move that was ordered by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "What's in the MLK files?",
      "A CBS News review found many of the documents released Monday focus on the FBI's role prior to MLK's assassination and its investigation of his death. Much of what is in the documents confirms long-established facts. Also included in the disclosure are newspaper clippings and records from other arms of government.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "It is not clear that the latest document release adds significantly to what was already known about King's assassination and the events that precipitated and followed it.",
      "The FBI surveilled and pursued King for years leading up to his death, suspicious of some members of the civil rights movement's ties to communism. A 1977\u00a0Justice Department report\u00a0concluded the surveillance of King was \"very probably\" illegal, noting the FBI had \"no evidence whatsoever that Dr. King was ever a communist\" and that one adviser of his in the early 1960s had \"disassociated himself\" from the Communist Party.",
      "One\u00a0page\u00a0in the files released Monday references an FBI technical surveillance operation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1965 that allegedly found \"communist influence\" on the SCLC through King. It alleges contacts between King and individuals \"with communist backgrounds.\"",
      "A 1963\u00a0memo\u00a0from assistant FBI director W.C. Sullivan says King \"stands head and shoulders over all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.\"",
      "There is also one audio recording: an interview with Jerry Ray, the brother of James Earl Ray. Jerry Ray said his brother never mentioned King or his feelings about \"negroes\" to him, and did not believe his brother assassinated King.",
      "What has MLK's family said about the files?",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan, saying: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",
      "The statement \u2014 released by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change \u2014 pointed to the FBI's yearslong surveillance of King in the 1960s.",
      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" article Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement that she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Why are the MLK files being released?",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",
      "Members of King's family have contended that Ray was not the shooter. Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy. In the 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that King was likely assassinated as part of a conspiracy involving Ray, but that the government wasn't involved.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has faced pressure from across the political spectrum \u2014 including from his supporters \u2014 to release government records on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after some members of his administration promised to disclose more information on the late financier. Last week, the Justice Department asked a court to unseal grand jury testimony from Epstein's 2019 child sex trafficking case.",
      "Late Monday, after records on her father were released, Bernice King\u00a0wrote on X: \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",

      "An appellate court has allowed the Trump administration to end a program that grants temporary deportation protections and work permits to more than 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "In a brief order Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote that the plaintiff \u2014 an immigration advocacy group called CASA \u2014 has a plausible case against the administration for choosing to end temporary protected status, or TPS, for Afghans and Cameroonians. But the court said \"there is insufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary remedy\" of blocking the government from phasing out TPS while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.",
      "One week ago, the appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Afghanistan for one week, while it considered the merits of CASA's case.",
      "The administration had planned to end the program for Afghans last week. The program is set to end for Cameroonians in two weeks, on Aug. 4.",
      "The appellate court on Monday directed a lower court to \"move expeditiously\" to hear the case.",
      "Around\u00a011,700 Afghans\u00a0and\u00a05,200 Cameroonians\u00a0are enrolled in TPS, the government estimates. But roughly 3,600 of the Afghans and 200 of the Cameroonians have green cards, so they will not be affected. Those who lose their TPS protections can apply for asylum or some other form of legal status, but otherwise, they will be at risk of deportation.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling \"another win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "\"TPS was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet it has been abused as one for decades. DHS records indicate that there are Afghan nationals who are TPS recipients who have been the subject of administrative investigations for fraud, public safety, and national security,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson called TPS a \"temporary benefit committed to the discretion of the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security,\" and said the administration was \"vindicated on appeal because the appeals court properly interpreted the law as written.\"",
      "AfghanEvac, a group that has helped relocate Afghans, said in a statement it is \"deeply alarmed\" by Monday's ruling.",
      "\"Lives will be upended. Families will be separated. Allies will be detained, deported, or forced into hiding\u2014while their legal rights remain unsettled,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in a statement Monday night.",
      "CBS News has reached out to CASA for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought for months to roll back TPS, a program that allows the government to grant relief from deportation and work permits for people whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to natural disasters or war.",
      "The government argues that the TPS program is intended to be temporary, and Cameroon and Afghanistan are now safe enough for TPS recipients to return.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration said Afghanistan's security situation and economy have improved despite the Taliban's 2021 takeover of the country following the U.S. military's withdrawal. And the government said a pair of armed conflicts in Cameroon \u2014 including a separatist conflict and an insurgency by the extremist group Boko Haram, which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2013 \u2014 are \"contained in limited regions\" and don't imperil people's personal safety in most of the country.",
      "\"This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a May statement announcing the Afghanistan decision.",
      "The State Department has placed a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory on Afghanistan, warning of the risk of \"civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.\"  The department advises travelers to Cameroon to exercise caution, and not to travel to certain parts of the country due to armed violence, crime and terrorism.",
      "CASA has argued in court papers that both countries are unsafe, and TPS recipients could be endangered if they're forced to return to their home countries. The group says the conflict in Cameroon \u2014 which involves English-speaking separatists in a mostly French-speaking country \u2014 has created a humanitarian crisis and wrecked the African country's economy. And people from Afghanistan, the group notes, were made eligible for TPS because of repression by the Taliban and conflict between the group and ISIS-K insurgents.",
      "CASA also argues the administration hasn't followed the correct legal processes to end TPS, and contends the decision was \"preordained\" and based partly on \"racial animus.\"",
      "\"That animus is evidenced by the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate lawful immigration status for noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominantly non-white, while simultaneously removing immigration barriers to noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominately white,\" the group said.",
      "Earlier this month, a lower court judge denied DHS's request to dismiss CASA's lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed, causing it to reach the 4th Circuit.",

      "Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, an intern of Rep. Ron Estes of Kansas, was shot and killed in Washington, D.C., on June 30. Police said at the time that they did not believe Tarpinian-Jachym was the intended target of the shooting, but the shooting has rattled many on Capitol Hill.",
      "The announcement also comes after Johnson and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries met last month in the wake of the shootings of Minnesota state lawmakers, Rep. Melissa Hortman and Sen. John Hoffman, and their spouses. Hortman and her husband were shot and killed in their home in the early hours of June 14, while Hoffman and his wife were shot and wounded roughly 5 miles away at their home.",
      "The FBI said the suspect, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, went to the homes of two other Minnesota lawmakers. Boelter has been charged with two counts of murder, two counts of stalking and two weapons charges.",
      "After the shootings, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also\u00a0said he had asked Capitol Police to increase security for members of Congress. All members of Congress received a security briefing in the days following the shootings, and Schumer called it \"more than a regional tragedy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House will leave town early for its monthlong summer break as members clash over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The lower chamber was originally scheduled to be in session through Thursday, but votes were scrapped as Democrats and some Republicans push for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files. Lawmakers will now head home until Sept. 2, after votes on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Monday night, the Epstein controversy disrupted another House Rules Committee meeting \u2014 the last hurdle for most legislation before it gets a floor vote \u2014 when Democrats threatened to make Republicans take more uncomfortable votes on Epstein-related amendments.",
      "The committee instead recessed for the remainder of the week, blocking the House from passing legislation with a simple majority. The House can still bypass the committee and approve noncontroversial legislation with a two-thirds majority.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of playing \"political games.\"",
      "\"We all understand that the America first agenda and the American people are best served by putting an end to the Democrat side shows, and that's what we're doing by not allowing the Rules Committee to continue with that nonsense this week,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "\"We are not going to let them use this as a political battering ram. The Rules Committee became the ground for them to do that,\" he said.",
      "House Republicans last week\u00a0offered a resolution\u00a0that carries no legal weight to make the Epstein files public as they faced increasing pressure on an issue that has split President Trump's base. But Johnson said Monday there would not be a vote on the issue before Congress' August recess.",
      "\"There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing,\" Johnson reiterated Tuesday.",
      "Last week, the Justice Department formally asked a federal judge\u00a0to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings at the direction of Mr. Trump.",
      "Numerous lawmakers have said that their offices are fielding calls from constituents wanting more information released.",
      "\"I don't think this issue is going away over August,\" Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said.",
      "Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California introduced a measure that would force the Justice Department to release Epstein-related files within 30 days. Massie plans to force a floor vote on the legislation once lawmakers return in September.",
      "\"I'm not quite certain what his strategy is,\" Johnson said. \"I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation. I really don't. I don't know how his mind works. I don't know what he's thinking. Thomas Massie could have brought his discharge petition anytime over the last four and a half years.\"",
      "\"When the speaker stands in the way of justice and transparency, this is how we get justice,\" Massie said Monday. Grand jury testimony is \"like one of 12 things that we need,\" he said, adding, \"I do believe that there are some things that need to be brought to the American public's knowledge that have happened that will be embarrassing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Labor Department is seeking to pull back on the regulation of workplaces by rewriting or repealing more than 60 \"obsolete\" regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge overseeing his criminal case to put off his release from custody for 30 days if the judge rejects a Justice Department bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting a trial.",
      "Abrego Garcica's lawyers said in a filing that the 30-day pause in issuing a release order would give him time to evaluate his legal options in response to likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him.",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings,\" they wrote.",
      "The Justice Department does not object to the request, and Abrego Garcia's legal team said that the delay would not affect their ability to come up with a proposed schedule leading up to his criminal trial.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia\u00a0in late May on two counts of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial in his case is set to begin in January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, but his removal gained headlines after a federal immigration official acknowledged it was an administrative error. An immigration judge had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented DHS from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland after coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and his wife filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in March challenging his removal, and a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "After weeks of back-and-forth \u2014 and his case reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in early June that Abrego Garcia had been released from Salvadoran custody and brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from his alleged participation in a scheme to smuggle undocumented migrants into the country.",
      "A federal magistrate judge last month ordered Abrego Garcia's release from federal law enforcement custody while he awaits a trial, but that raised concerns that he would be swiftly detained by immigration agents and possibly deported. The Justice Department appealed that decision and asked a U.S. district judge to revoke the release order.",
      "The judge overseeing the criminal case, Waverly Crenshaw, held a hearing last week on the government's motion but has not yet ruled on whether to grant it. If Crenshaw denies the bid, it would give the green-light for Abrego Garcia to be released from criminal custody.",
      "But the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings has created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "In the ongoing civil case in Maryland, the federal judge is considering a separate request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to return him to Maryland immediately after he is released from confinement in the criminal proceedings that are ongoing in Tennessee. They also asked the judge to bar the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson said there will not be a vote before Congress' August recess on a resolution that calls on the Trump administration to release more files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters Monday. \"But I don't think we're at that point right now because we agree with the president.\"",

      "\"We should not punt this until after the 5 week recess, nor should we wait for my discharge petition to ripen and collect the required signatures to force the vote,\" Massie wrote.",

This is about whether there's an elite and powerful group of people who are above the law, or whether they answer to the law. That's what this is about. Right now, anybody who wants to subvert or keep the Epstein files secret, they are on the wrong side.\"",
      "Johnson called the endeavor \"a political game that Democrats are playing, and I hope Republicans don't join it.\" He also reiterated that there's \"no daylight\" between the White House and House Republicans on wanting more transparency.",

    "story": [
      "The Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with a $65.56 million cash on hand advantage over the Democratic Party, as the left works to rebound from 2024 election losses and the right continues to deeply intertwine its future with President Trump.",
      "New campaign finance filings show the RNC had more than $80.7 million at the end of June, while the Democratic National Committee finished with around $15.2 million in cash on hand as both parties prepare for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"The RNC has been working hand in glove with President Trump's team to build the war chest needed to protect and expand our Republican majorities in Congress next year,\" RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement. \"Vice President Vance has done an amazing job as the RNC's finance chair working with Chairman Whatley to do just that, and we're not going to stop.\"",
      "The gap between the two is far wider than this same time period before the 2018 midterms, when the RNC's cash on hand advantage over the DNC was $37.2 million at the end of June 2017. The political dynamics at that point were similar to now, with President Trump months removed from winning the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won back the House and started to build momentum that carried over into Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "While the midterms are still more than a year away, it already appears likely the House will be Democrats' easiest route to winning back power in Washington. Republicans are also contending with the potential challenge that often befalls the party of the president, where the midterms become a referendum on the commander in chief.",
      "Democrats are facing continued questions about their approach moving forward after last fall's election setbacks, where Mr. Trump won a second term as president and the party lost the Senate and failed to retake the House. Earlier this year, party leaders chose Ken Martin, then the head of Minnesota's Democratic Party, to take over the DNC in an attempt to gain stronger footing with next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election in mind.",
      "But in his first months as party chair, Martin was forced to contend with intraparty tensions and disputes as he attempted to offer a stronger counter to Mr. Trump's second term and Republican control in Washington.",
      "The Martin-led DNC has succeeded however in raising more money than the national party organization did at this same stage in 2017, and in a recent news release, the DNC shared its finding that \"contributions during the first five months of Chair Martin's leadership are nearly 2:1 dollars raised in the months after the 2016 cycle.\"",
      "\"The DNC is breaking grassroots fundraising records, bringing on more volunteers than ever, and raising record-setting funds to beat Republicans. Democrats are back in the ring thanks to grassroots energy across all 50 states, and together, we're going to defeat the toxic Republican agenda and put this country back on track for hard-working families,\" Martin said in a statement.",
      "But the new round of campaign finance disclosures also underscores the challenges Democrats continue to face this year. Through the first six months of 2025, filings show the DNC taking in a little more than $69 million while the RNC's total receipts were over $96 million.",

      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:13:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "Kohberger\u00a0pleaded guilty earlier this month to the murders\u00a0of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves as part of a plea deal that spared him\u00a0from the death penalty. The\u00a0plea agreement\u00a0states he will be receive four life sentences without the possibility of parole, one for each murder charge, and a 10-year sentence for a burglary charge that he also pleaded guilty to. During his plea hearing, Judge Steven Hippler said the court is not bound by the plea agreement and could impose a different sentence.",
      "The hearing began shortly after 9 a.m. Kohberger was in the courtroom wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. The hearing is expected to last the day, with some scheduled breaks, although the judge said it could be extended into Thursday to ensure there is enough time for the families to read victim impact statements.",
      "Chapin, Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves were killed at a home in Moscow, Idaho, during the\u00a0early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger was arrested at his\u00a0parents' home in Pennsylvania\u00a0six weeks later. Prosecutors said that if the case had gone to trial they would have used\u00a0DNA evidence\u00a0that linked Kohberger to the crime scene, his\u00a0online purchase history, surveillance video of Koherger's car, and cellphone data that showed him in the vicinity of the killings.",
      "The families of the victims have been\u00a0divided over the plea deal. Mogen's father told CBS News he was relieved to learn of the deal, saying it will allow his family to \"actually put this behind us.\" The Goncalves family has bitterly criticized the agreement, and\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0after a\u00a0gag order was lifted\u00a0that they believe the plea deal gives Kohberger a chance to live a \"better and more rewarding life inside\" prison.",
      "Victim impact statements read aloud",

      "\"That was the worst day of my life, and I know it always will be,\" Funke said in the statement, which was read by friend Emily Alant. Funke added that she checks her room every night to ensure there is no one hiding in the space, and said she has struggled to sleep since the slayings. Alant cried as she read the statement, while Kohberger showed no emotion.",

      "Scott Laramie, Madison Mogen's stepfather, then read a victim impact statement on the behalf of himself and Mogen's mother, Karen Laramie.

      "\"This world was a better place with her in it,\" Laramie said.",

      "But the image he'll always remember is one he took of a fatal 1975 fire.",
      "As the fire was racing through an apartment building, Forman saw a firefighter who had just reached a young woman and a 2-year-old girl trapped on a rickety fifth-story fire escape. Then, the unthinkable happened.",
      "\"And then it went. Just collapsed. For whatever reason, it collapsed. The fire escape collapsed,\" Forman told CBS News. \"They're falling. There's no doubt they're falling, and the fire escape coming down behind them. I realized two people had fallen to the ground.\"",

      "\"I just watched something awful, awful happen,\" he said. \"I never had doubts about getting the picture, but I just watched something awful happen.\"",

      "A firefighter, Robert O'Neill, dangled with one arm clutching the fire engine's ladder and survived. But the fall killed 19-year-old Diana Bryant. Tiare Jones, Bryant's 2-year-old goddaughter, landed on top of Bryant and lived.",

      "The planes were not considered a threat, as Russian activity in that airspace happens regularly, according to the military command. U.S. officials have not specified the type of aircraft spotted this week or how many of them were there. CBS News has reached out to NORAD for more information.",

    "summary": "A small plane that crashed in 2023 carrying moose meat in Alaska, killing the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, was overweight and encountered drag from antlers mounted outside, the NTSB says.",
    "story": [
      "Juneau, Alaska \u2014 A small plane that crashed in 2023 while carrying moose meat for hunters in remote western Alaska, killing the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, was overweight for takeoff and encountered drag from a set of antlers mounted outside, federal investigators said in a report released Tuesday.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board, in its final report on the crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., who was the only person on board the aircraft, listed several factors among its probable cause findings. They included decisions by Peltola to fly the plane above its maximum takeoff weight and affix a set of moose antlers on the right wing strut that caused a drag, along with turbulent flight conditions in the area.",
      "Downdrafts, \"along with the overweight airplane and the added drag and lateral weight imbalance caused by the antlers on the right wing, would likely have resulted in the airplane having insufficient power and/or control authority to maneuver above terrain,\" the report states.",
      "\"Number one was, obviously, the overweight condition \u2014 no ifs, ands, or buts there,\" CBS Anchorage affiliate KYES-TV quotes NTSB Alaska Region Chief Clint Johnson as saying. \"The parasitic drag from the antlers that were attached to the right wing, and then also the last thing would be the wind, the mechanical wind turbulence at the end of the takeoff area, which unfortunately, led to this accident.",
      "\"If you would have been able to take one of those items out, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. But those things all in combination led to this tragic accident.\"",
      "The Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub crashed Sept. 12, 2023, northeast of the small western Alaska community of St. Mary's. Peltola had days earlier taken five hunters, a guide and equipment from the community of Holy Cross to an airstrip at St. Mary's. The group set up camp next to the runway, which was near hilly terrain and about 70 miles northwest of Holy Cross, the agency said.",
      "The day before the crash, the group got a moose and made plans with Peltola, via satellite messaging devices, for him to transport the meat, the NTSB said. On the day of the crash, Peltola had already picked up a load of meat and had returned for another. He didn't use scales to weigh the cargo, the agency said.",
      "\"The meat was strapped into the rear passenger seat area with both the seatbelt and rope and was loaded into the airplane's belly pod, which did not have tie-down provisions,\" a September 2023 NTSB preliminary report on the crash\u00a0said.",
      "The NTSB found about 150 pounds of the meat in the forward section of the belly pod after the crash, the report said. One of the hunters said Peltola Jr. told him he would be running on reserve fuel by the time he arrived back at Holy Cross.",
      "Two hunters were at the site when the crash occurred and provided aid to Peltola, the agency previously reported. Peltola died of his injuries within about two hours, the agency said.",
      "\"Given the remote location of the accident site, which was about 400 miles from a hospital, and accessible only by air, providing the pilot with prompt medical treatment following the accident was not possible,\" Tuesday's report states.",
      "The agency said carrying antlers on the outside of a plane is a common practice in Alaska but requires formal approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, with a notation in the plane's logbooks. \"There was no evidence that such approval had been granted for the accident airplane,\" the report states.",
      "Peltola was a former Alaska regional director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and worked for decades for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He had received his commercial pilot's license in 2004, requiring him to use corrective lenses at all distances, according to an FAA database.",
      "His death came almost exactly a year after Mary Peltola was sworn in as Alaska's lone U.S. House member, following a special election for the seat. Mary Peltola, who is Yup'ik, was the first Alaska Native in Congress.",
      "Peltola, a Democrat, defeated former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in a 2022 special election for the House seat, which had been left vacant after\u00a0Rep. Don Young died\u00a0in office at the age of 88.",
      "She won a full, two-year term in November 2022 but lost her reelection bid last November and has kept a relatively low public profile since then.",

      "This was the first singles victory for Williams in nearly two years. The only older woman to win a match was Martina Navratilova at 47 in 2004.",
      "The former No. 1-ranked Williams had not played singles in an official match since March 2024 in Miami, missing time while having surgery to remove uterine fibroids. She hadn't won in singles since August 2023 in Cincinnati. Until this week, she was listed by the WTA Tour as \"inactive.\"",
      "\"It is not easy,\" Williams said, \"to (come back) after all that time and play the perfect match.\"",
      "But backed by a crowd that clearly was there to see, and support, her at the hard-court tournament in the nation's capital, Williams showed glimpses of the talent she possesses and the skills she displayed while earning all of her Grand Slam titles: seven in singles, 14 in women's doubles \u2014 all alongside younger sister Serena \u2014 and two in mixed doubles.",
      "\"I wanted to play a good match,\" she told the fans, then added a phrase that drew appreciative roars: \"and win the match.\"",
      "In Tuesday's second game, for example, Williams smacked a return winner to get things started, then delivered a couple of other big responses to break Stearns, a 23-year-old who won singles and team NCAA titles at the University of Texas and is currently ranked 35th.",
      "In the next game, Williams sprinted forward to reach a drop shot and replied with a winner. Soon, she led 4-2, then closed that set.",
      "She was accompanied by choruses of cheers. The first arrived when Williams walked out into the main stadium at the DC Open, a 7,000-seat arena that's more than twice as large as where she was for her doubles victory a day earlier. Another came when she strode from the sideline to the center of the court for the formality of the coin toss. The noise really reached a crescendo when Williams began hitting aces \u2014 at 110 mph and faster \u2014 the way she used to.",
      "There also were moments where Williams \u2014 who said her fianc\u00e9 was in the stands \u2014 looked as if it had been just as long as it actually has since she competed, including in the opening game, when she got broken at love this way: forehand wide, forehand into the net, forehand long, backhand long.",
      "At the end, it took Williams a bit of extra effort to close things out. She kept holding match points and kept failing to convert them. But eventually, she powered in a 112 mph serve that Stearns returned into the net. That was it: Williams smiled wide as can be and jogged to the net to shake hands, then performed her customary post-win pirouette-and-wave.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling the federations overseeing swimming, athletics and other sports it has an \"obligation to comply\" with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0issued by President Trump.",
      "The new policy, announced Monday with\u00a0a quiet change on the USOPC's website\u00a0and confirmed in a letter sent to national sport governing bodies, follows a similar step taken by the NCAA earlier this year.",
      "The USOPC change is noted obliquely as a detail under \"USOPC Athlete Safety Policy\" and references Mr. Trump's executive order, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" signed in February. That order, among other things, threatens to \"rescind all funds\" from organizations that allow transgender athlete participation in women's sports.",
      "U.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that \"the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials\" since Mr. Trump signed the order.",
      "\"As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. \"Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.\"",
      "At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, just one openly transgender U.S. athlete competed. Nikki Hiltz, a middle-distance runner from California who uses they/them pronouns, was assigned female at birth. It's unclear how the change announced by USOPC would impact Hiltz.",
      "At a\u00a0USOPC meeting in April, Hirshland said that the committee had no plans to define eligibility criteria ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\"So typically speaking at an international level, the international federations will define eligibility criteria for the events in which they own jurisdiction, world Cups, world Championships, et cetera, and the national governing bodies domestically would define eligibility criteria for their events,\" Hirshland said at the time. \"In some cases those may be elite level events, national championships and things. In other cases those may be lower level grassroots youth sport competitions and things of that nature. So we do not have, nor will we have an eligibility policy, it wouldn't be appropriate, it's not our role to take on that position.\"",
      "The National Women's Law Center put out a statement condemning the move.",
      "\"By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,\" said that organization's president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.",
      "The USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs.",
      "Some of those organizations \u2014 for instance, USA Track and Field \u2014 have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Mr. Trump's order.",
      "A USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC's change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only \"athletes who are of the female sex\" in women's competition and opening men's events to \"all athletes not eligible for the women's category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.\"",
      "The nationwide battle over transgender athletes on girls' and women's sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court by those who say the policies are discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear a case over whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Also earlier this month, the Justice Department\u00a0filed a civil lawsuit against California's Department of Education and a nongovernmental sports organization alleging that they violated federal civil rights laws, including Title IX, by implementing policies that \"force girls to compete against boys\" in state athletic events.",
      "The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Mr. Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "Earlier this month, the University of Pennsylvania said it would ban transgender women from participating in its women's sports teams as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school for allowing\u00a0Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, to compete for\u00a0its women's swimming team in 2021 and 2022.",
      "Female eligibility is a key issue for the International Olympic Committee\u00a0under its new president, Kirsty Coventry, who has signaled an effort to \"protect the female category.\" The IOC has allowed individual sports federations to set their own rules at the Olympics \u2014 and some have already taken steps on the topic.",
      "Stricter rules on transgender athletes \u2014 barring from women's events anyone who went through male puberty \u2014 have been passed by swimming, cycling and track and field. Soccer is reviewing its eligibility rules for women and could set limits on testosterone.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he wants the IOC to change everything \"having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.\"",
      "As he took office earlier this year, the president signed an executive order declaring that it is the policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female.\" Mr. Trump campaigned on the issue and spent tens of millions of dollars on political ads that focused on transgender rights.",

      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling roughly 5 million above-ground pools linked to the deaths of nine children over the last two decades.",
      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others. Over 250,000 were also sold in Canada. They range in price from $400 to over $1,000, according to the CPSC.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools. The updated standard, finalized in May 2025, \"aims to prevent unsupervised children from gaining a foothold on the products from compression straps that surround the outside of the pool legs,\" the companies' statement said.",
      "The recall, issued jointly by the CPSC and Bestway, Intex and Polygroup, was made to ensure that the new changes be applied to \"all above-ground pools sold since 2002 that are 48 inches or taller in height,\" according to the statement.",
      "Consumers are encouraged to contact Bestway, Intex and Polygroup for a free repair kit, which includes a rope used to maintain the structural integrity of the pool. The recall number is 25-393.",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing protests and EU criticism for the first time since Russia invaded, over changes to national anti-corruption agencies.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, widespread protests have taken place across Ukraine \u2014 not against Russia or its President Vladimir Putin, but against Ukraine's own President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's parliament, the Rada.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Zelenskyy signed a bill into law, after it was fast-tracked through the Rada, that gives Ukraine's prosecutor general (roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general), more power over two anti-corruption agencies long known for their fierce independence. The prosecutor general is a political appointee, not an elected official.",
      "In the hours before Zelenskyy signed the measure, thousands of people in the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv, Dnipro in the east and Odessa in the south made their frustration and fear known, defying martial law bans on mass gatherings to come out and protest. Their concern is rooted in the continued autonomy of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), which for years have sought to combat graft by public officials, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Some critics argue the new law is political retribution. In April, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau charged a former deputy head of Zelenskyy's administration, Andrii Smyrnov, with money laundering and accepting a bribe. Others fear a potential backslide back into some degree of authoritarianism in the country that was previously led by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "The 27-nation European Union, which has been a staunch supporter of Zelenskyy and Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, also voiced concern over the changes to the management of the anti-corruption agencies. Demonstrably fighting corruption is crucial to Ukraine's bid to join the EU.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos called the vote by Ukraine's parliament \"a serious step back\" in a post on social media, adding that \"independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the anger in his country over the new legislation, saying in a statement posted on social media after the Rada's vote: \"We all hear what society is saying.\"",
      "\"We see what people expect from state institutions \u2014 ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution. We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\"",
      "Earlier he had stressed that the two anti-corruption agencies would still \"work,\" but he said they needed to be clear of what he claimed was \"Russian influence.\" He said some major corruption cases had been \"lying dormant\" with the agencies for years without any rational explanation, but offered no explanation of the alleged Russian influence.",
      "New round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that a third round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks would begin in Turkey on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Our delegation is flying to Istanbul, and indeed negotiations are scheduled to take place there tonight,\" said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. \"The main topic of discussion will be peace memorandums that were shared during the second round of talks.\"",
      "He said the two sides would discuss further prisoner swaps. Over the past two months, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners of war, but the negotiations have thus far yielded little hope of a ceasefire in the war.",
      "On Tuesday, Peskov said Moscow did not expect any \"miraculous breakthrough\" in Turkey, calling the two sides \"diametrically opposed.\"",
      "Moscow has demanded a litany of concessions from Ukraine, including that it give up territory Russian troops have seized during the war. Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin's government has also demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions of joining the EU and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, and even insisted that it should significantly downsize its military and make Russian the official language of Ukraine.",

      "Italy's national news agency ANSA said the venue had canceled the concert, offering no explanation. A representative at the Reggia di Caserta confirmed the cancellation to CBS News over the phone.",
      "The move came after criticism from Italian lawmakers, human rights advocates and Russian political dissidents.",
      "Among the most vocal opponents to Italy welcoming Gergiev was Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. She condemned Gergiev's public support for the Kremlin and accused the conductor of using his platform to legitimize Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "In a message posted on social media, Navalnaya called news of the cancellation, \"not joyful, but good.\"",
      "\"No artist who supports the current dictatorship in Russia should be welcomed in Europe. It is precisely thanks to regime loyalists like Gergiev that Putin tries to promote his image as a 'respectable person' in the West,\" she said. \"It's a small step, but great victories are built from such small steps.\"",
      "Gergiev, once lauded in the West as the \"Wild Man of Music,\" has become a contentious figure in recent years, particularly in Europe, where a range of institutions have sought to distance themselves from artists aligned with the Russian government.",

      "Choi Mal-ja was 19 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae in 1964. He pinned her to the ground and forced his tongue into her mouth, court records showed. Choi managed to break free by biting off about half an inch of his tongue.",

      "London\u00a0\u2014 The families of some British victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad have discovered that remains repatriated to the U.K. were wrongly identified as being their loved ones, a lawyer who says his firm is representing over 20 victims' families told CBS News. Of the 242 people on board the Air India flight from Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport that crashed on June 12 just minutes after takeoff, 52 were British citizens.",
      "The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, but a preliminary report released earlier this month by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that cockpit cutoff switches for fuel supply to both of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner's engines had been switched, one after another, within one second, leading to both engines losing thrust.",
      "James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer who said he was representing a number of U.K. families, told CBS News the remains of at least 12 British victims of the crash had been repatriated to the U.K., but that two of them had been misidentified.",
      "\"There was one family who believed they had accompanied their loved one back from India, having gone out there to give DNA for the identification, and then (when they returned to the U.K.) were informed that the remains in the casket were nothing to do with them,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the mistakes were discovered when the Inner West London coroner, Dr. Fiona Wilcox, sought to verify the victims' identities by matching their DNA to samples provided by the families.",
      "\"The first two caskets that arrived into the country \u2014 Dr. Wilcox and her team, assiduous as always, decided to check the verification and identity, and they discovered that DNA had been commingled in one of the caskets, which wasn't related to the person in the casket or the other person,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the family of one of the victims had to cancel funeral plans after being told the remains they thought belonged to their loved one were actually those of an unknown individual.",
      "\"It's a double psychological trauma. It's one thing to lose a loved one, but then you go to India, you sit in a hotel, you give your DNA, you pray to God that there'll be a DNA match. You're then told there is. You're assured everything's fine and certified. You come back, and then you're told either there's more remains in the casket than just your loved one, or there are no remains, in spite of having been certified, and we don't know who this is,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Indian officials cited by local media soon after the crash said that, given the level of the destruction at the site and the extent to which the wreckage was burned, DNA testing would be required to confirm the final death toll from both the plane and from the buildings at the site in Ahmedabad.",
      "\"We have seen the report and have been working closely with the U.K. side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention,\" Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement Wednesday. \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. We are continuing to work with the U.K. authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\"",
      "Healy-Pratt said the statement from the Indian Foreign Ministry statement was \"simply not good enough.\"",
      "\"It lacks specifics. It lacks any detailed explanation of the chain of custody of the remains from the time of identification to DNA matching to placing in caskets. It lacks any assurances that there may be remains, whether mislabeled, unidentified or identified, still in India,\" he said.",
      "\"The families want to draw a line under their emotional distress that's come out from this and so that requires detailed hard work by the Indian authorities to provide assurances that there are no further remains of British nationals either unidentified, identified or mislabeled, misidentified in India. And the line will not be drawn until that cast iron assurance is provided. And at the moment, it's not forthcoming,\" he said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to meet in London this week, and Healy-Pratt said he hoped this issue would make it onto their agenda.",
      "Healy-Pratt also said that, in addition to seeking the remains of their loved ones, the British families want to know the cause of the Air India crash, so their lawyers are independently investigating. The families, Healy-Pratt said, want to make sure any safety recommendations that come from formal probes are implemented internationally.",
      "\"And then finally, they want financial justice,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "He said the families' legal team had \"already made an approach to the lawyers for Air India in London, and we're progressing claims there in the High Court. And we'll also be filing an action against Boeing in the U.S. courts to get more information about these fuel control cutoff switches, because they do have a checkered history.\"",

      "In a briefing with reporters Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce suggested Witkoff could soon go to the Middle East, but declined to provide details about his itinerary.",
      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing, according to an Israeli official, and the Israeli government expects to soon receive Hamas' response to an offer made last week.",
      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",
      "Officials from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also said more than 80 people were killed trying to access emergency food supplies on Sunday.",

    "story": [
      "When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\"I would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that's wrecked,\" said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation. The group posted video about the shipwreck early Wednesday.",
      "\"I think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn't necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\" Saunders said.",
      "Uncovered after 250 years",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland's northern tip.",
      "As CBS News partner BBC News reported at the time, the timbers were held together with large wooden pegs, and locals on the island said they believed the ship may have been released from the seabed by violent winter storms.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile island since the 15th century.",
      "Resident David Walker told BBC Radio he was a history buff and he headed straight to the scene to take photos when he heard word of the discovery.",
      "\"My interest made me jump straight in the van and head over and have a look,\" he told BBC Radio Orkney. \"It's incredible, that was why I took so many pictures.\"",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\"That was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2014 everybody pulling together to get it back,\" said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island's community researchers. \"Quite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\"",
      "In September 2024, the shipwreck was put in a water tank for preservation and study, BBC News reported.",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \"the point where British bureaucracy's really starting to kick off\" and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\"And so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\" Saunders said. \"It becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\"You remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\"",
      "Wars and whaling",
      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England's south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain's failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "Community effort",
      "The ship's timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",
      "\"The community have been so keen, have been so desirous to be involved and to find out things to learn, and they're so proud of it. It's down to them it was discovered, it's down to them it was recovered and it's been stabilized and been protected,\" he said.",
      "For locals, it's a link to the island's maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",
      "\"One of the biggest things I've got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\" said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

    "story": [
      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis ... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles.

    "summary": "Ozzy Osbourne rose to fame in the heavy metal group Black Sabbath.",
    "story": [
      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",

      "A Delta flight had just begun its takeoff roll at Benito Ju\u00e1rez Mexico City International Airport when a regional jet appeared to fly over the plane and land in front of it on the same runway, forcing the Delta pilots to hit the brakes.",
      "Aeromexico Flight 1691, arriving from the city of Aguascalientes, touched down on Monday as Atlanta-bound Delta flight 590 was accelerating to initiate takeoff at 7:28 a.m. local time, according to Delta and preliminary flight data from the tracking site\u00a0Flightradar24. The data shows that the Delta Boeing 737-800 reached 62 knots, or about 71 miles per hour, before pilots stopped the plane and halted their takeoff.",
      "The Delta pilots exited the runway and returned to the gate, the airline said. The plane received additional fuel and eventually departed for Atlanta at 9:42 a.m. The flight carrying 144 passengers and six crew members landed safely in Atlanta at 3:20 p.m. ET, according to Delta.",
      "\"Because nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, Delta will fully cooperate with authorities as the circumstances around this flight are investigated. We appreciate the flight crew's actions to maintain situational awareness and act quickly \u2013 part of Delta's extensive training,\" a Delta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "In the wake of the incident, Delta says it filed reports with the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and Mexico's Federal Civil Aviation Agency, which is the country's aviation regulator.",
      "Aeromexico said it is working closely with the corresponding authorities to conduct an investigation. \"At Aeromexico, the safety of our customers and employees is, and will always be, our highest priority,\" the airline's statement said.",
      "Mexican aviation authorities had no comment when contacted by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Days before the incident in Mexico, the pilot of a SkyWest flight \u2014 which was operating as Delta Connection \u2014 apologized to passengers after performing what he described as an\u00a0\"aggressive maneuver\"\u00a0while approaching a runway in Minot, North Dakota, where the plane was set for landing.

    "story": [
      "An American airman who was killed after being trapped on a mountain with his unit during the Vietnam War has been accounted for nearly 60 years after his death, military officials said Monday.",
      "U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall was assigned to Lima Site 85, a tactical air navigation radio site on a remote mountain peak in Laos, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. There were 18 other men assigned to the site. On March 11, 1968, the location was attacked by Vietnamese commandos, marking the start of a major offensive by communist Vietnamese forces in Laos, which was a neutral country at that time, according to newspaper clippings shared by the DPAA.",
      "The unit had to evacuate to a narrow ledge of the 5,600-foot mountain. A few hours later, an A-1 Skyraider aircraft was able to provide cover for a rescue operation. U.S. helicopters managed to rescue eight of the men and travel to a base in Thailand. One of the rescued men died while en route to the base, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "Hall and 10 other American soldiers were killed, and their bodies were unable to be recovered, officials said. Hall, a native of Broward County, Florida,   was 40 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife Mary, according to newspaper clippings. His name has been engraved on the Courts of the Missing at the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, and on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C., the DPAA said.",
      "In 1994, a joint recovery operation by the U.S. and Laos failed to find any of the 11 servicemembers' remains, but nine years later, a second operation found one set of remains. A 2005 newspaper clipping said that to find the remains, U.S. investigators spoke to Vietnamese commandos who had been involved in the attack. The commandos showed the investigators where they had thrown the bodies of the dead servicemembers off the mountain. Investigators threw dummies from those sites, and used a video camera mounted on a helicopter to see where they landed.",
      "In 2023, DPAA personnel and partner organization members discovered unexploded ordnance, incident-related materials and possible material evidence and bones near another site on the mountain. Those remains were found to be those of a second technician who died during the attack.",
      "Joint recovery teams returned to the mountain earlier this year. Across two operations, the teams found possible human remains and other evidence. Those remains were taken to the DPAA Laboratory.",
      "At the laboratory, DPAA scientists used anthropological analysis and DNA analysis to study the remains. They also used material evidence found at the site to identify the remains as Hall's.",
      "Hall's family was briefed on his identification in last month. A rosette will be placed on his name on the Courts of the Missing and at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to show that he has been accounted for. Hall is set to be buried in Altoona, Kansas, in September.",

    "summary": "South Korean officials planned to publicize the results of an investigation into the cause of the crash but canceled the briefing after strong protests by relatives of victims.",
    "story": [
      "The initial results of an investigation into December's devastating Jeju Air crash in South Korea showed that, while the plane's both engines sustained bird strikes, its pilots turned off the less-damaged one just before its crash-landing. The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",
      "South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board initially planned to publicize the results of an investigation of the plane's engines on Saturday. But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\"If they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\" said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \"None of us resent the pilots.\"",
      "The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air landed on its belly without its land gear deployed at South Korea's southern Muan International Airport on Dec. 29. It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea's aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",
      "According to a copy of an unpublished briefing report obtained by The Associated Press, a South Korean-led multilateral investigation team said it found no defects in the plane's engines built by France's Safran and GE.",
      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane's right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane's left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",
      "Officials earlier said the black boxes of the Boeing jetliner stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, complicating investigations into the cause of the disaster. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder cited in the briefing report refers to data stored before the recording stopped.",
      "The report didn't say why the pilots shut off the less-damaged engine and stopped short of saying whether it was an error by the pilots.",
      "Bereaved families and pilots at Jeju Air and other airlines lambasted the investigation findings, saying authorities must disclose the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.",
      "\"We, the 6,500 pilots at civilian airlines, can't contain our seething anger against the preposterous argument by the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board that lost neutrality,\" the Korean Pilot Unions Alliance said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Unionized pilots at Jeju Air also issued a statement urging authorities to present scientific evidence to show the plane should have landed normally if it flew with the less-damaged engine.",
      "The latest report focused only on engine issues and didn't mention other factors that could also be blamed for the crash. Among them is the concrete structure the plane crashed into. It housed a set of antennas called localizers designed to guide aircraft safely during landings, and many analysts say it should have been made with more easily breakable materials. Some pilots say they suspect the government wouldn't want to mainly and prominently blame the localizers or bird strikes for mass deaths as the Muan airport is under direct management of the Transport Ministry.",
      "The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board and the Transport Ministry have offered no public response to the criticism. They said they also won't publicly discuss the engine investigations to respect demands by bereaved families.",
      "A person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities are looking at the localizers and other issues like whether air traffic controllers relayed the danger of bird strikes to the pilots swiftly enough and what emergency training Jeju Air offered to pilots. The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigations at the request of bereaved families. He said authorities don't intend to lay the responsibility for the disaster to the pilots.",
      "Authorities aim to publish the investigation's final results by next June, the person said.",
      "But Kwon Bo Hun, dean of Aeronautics College at the Far East University in South Korea, called the government's planned announcement \"clumsy\" because it didn't disclose evidence that supported its finding on the pilots. He said it only irritated \"emotional parts of us that the investigation puts the whole blame on dead people.\"",
      "A former Transport Ministry-turned-university professor reached by the AP said the engine investigation report must be \"reliable\" as it's based on an analysis of cockpit voice and flight data recorders that \"don't lie.\" He spoke on condition of anonymity citing the delicate nature of the issue.",

      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow.\"",

      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",

      "The IMO said tech companies had \"privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,\" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries.",
      "\"It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,\" said IMO president Dolinar.",
      "Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted.",
      "In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities \u2014 a landmark known as \"artificial general intelligence.\"",
      "Google DeepMind CEO\u00a0Demis Hassabis predicted\u00a0that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.",
      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

      "In 2023, four harvesters died, possibly the result of sunstroke after working in scorching heat.",

      "\"Queen Elizabeth would undoubtedly have been hurt by the change in Harry\u2019s behavior,\" said Fitzwilliams. \"Having known him for so long, she would have expected him to be loyal to her. Her reported surprise over Meghan wearing white and disapproval that she wore a veil at her wedding would not have endeared her to the couple who wanted to do things their way.\"",
      "\"After they stepped down from royal duties, they were careful never to criticize Queen Elizabeth personally, but trashed the institution she headed, knowing it was next to impossible for [the palace] to answer their charges directly,\" Fitzwilliams continued. \"The irony is that the queen\u2019s dignified comment, \u2018some recollections may vary,\u2019 is what is best remembered.\"",

      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",

      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",

      "In the final decision, Gibbons, however, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the law is too vague to be constitutional under the Due Process Clause. The judge sided with the state on that matter, saying the law is sufficiently specific in what behavior is forbidden.

      "\"The court grants summary judgment for the plaintiffs on their free speech claims and enjoins enforcement of the recruiting prong of the statute,\" Gibbons wrote. \"The statute is not, however, void for vagueness.

      "Madeline Gardner is the youngest American person to get a Hero Arm, the world's first multi-grip bionic arm for children.",
      "Kicking a ball or climbing stairs with ease after a leg amputation above the knee is now within reach. Researchers at MIT have developed a bionic knee that redefines mobility for above-the-knee amputees. Unlike traditional socket-based prosthetics, this system anchors directly to the bone and integrates with the surrounding muscle tissue. The result is faster, smoother, and more natural movement.",
      "Led by Professor Hugh Herr, the MIT team created a solution that doesn't just mimic motion, it responds to intent. This level of control allows the prosthesis to move in sync with the body, delivering a seamless experience that challenges the very definition of artificial limbs.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",
      "One participant with only a few inches of thigh remaining could walk, pivot, and even kick a ball smoothly. This kind of intuitive, natural movement is a game-changer for above-the-knee amputees.",
      "Illustration of a new e-OPRA bionic knee that can help people with above-the-knee amputations. (MIT)",
      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",
      "A man kicking balls while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "When the bionic knee for amputees will be available",
      "While the results are groundbreaking, the e-OPRA system isn't on the market yet. Larger clinical trials and FDA approval are still ahead. Herr estimates that within five years, this technology could become more accessible to patients.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We're witnessing the future of\u00a0prosthetics unfold. The bionic knee developed by MIT doesn't just restore function, it redefines it. By merging advanced robotics with the human nervous system, it offers amputees something priceless: the feeling that their body is whole again.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

      "How humanoid robots could transform healthcare and hospital staffing",
      "This is the first major study to add humanoid robots to hospital work systems. With aging populations and ongoing labor shortages, these adaptable robots could support routine and emergency tasks in hospital settings. This robot could take immense pressure off medical staff. The versatility and ability to be remotely controlled make it particularly appealing for settings that require rapid response and tools that can carry out a wide range of tasks.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've ever waited too long in an ER, struggled to book a specialist appointment, or worried about overworked healthcare providers, this research should catch your attention. Humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 aren't replacing doctors, but they could support them in real, practical ways. From performing emergency procedures in remote areas to helping with routine physical exams in crowded hospitals, these robots could ease bottlenecks and improve care access.",
      "For patients, that could mean shorter wait times, faster treatment, and safer hospital environments where medical teams are less stretched. For families in rural or underserved areas, this technology could offer critical care support where medical staff is limited. And for healthcare workers, it could bring much-needed relief by taking on repetitive or physically taxing tasks.",
      "While the tech is still evolving, these early results suggest a future where hospitals have robotic teammates, not just tools, helping deliver faster, smarter care.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 are not ready to fully replace humans, they're steadily proving how capable they are in medical environments. The researchers just need to solve issues like force control, sensitivity, and dexterity. Once they do, we will see these robots in operating rooms around the world assisting with surgeries. They will make our struggling healthcare systems far more resilient and accessible.",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",

That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Amazon website\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Amazon is using AI to improve product listings",
      "Starfish builds on earlier AI tools that Amazon began testing in 2023. These tools could:",
      "Automatically generate product images and video adsFill in missing data for third-party listingsRewrite product titles, bullet points and descriptions to be more relevant",
      "Automatically generate product images and video ads",
      "Fill in missing data for third-party listings",
      "Rewrite product titles, bullet points and descriptions to be more relevant",
      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "A new material looks like regular concrete but crumbles like a marshmallow when a plane lands on it in an emergency. Known as marshmallow concrete, this ultra-light foam absorbs an aircraft's energy and helps bring it to a safe stop during runway overruns.",
      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin. This structure allows the foam to crush in a controlled way and cushion even the heaviest aircraft.",

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",
      "A China Building Materials Academy researcher at work\u00a0 (CBMA)",
      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong. As U.S. airport authorities and the FAA explore more innovative, more cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure, marshmallow concrete could be one of the safest bets in American aviation's future.",

      "Marshmallow concrete is changing the way airports think about safety. By combining strength, flexibility, and affordability, this new material offers airports a smarter way to protect passengers and crews. As more airports around the world look for reliable solutions, marshmallow concrete stands out as a proven option that delivers results.

      "The serious wildlife threat facing airfields today",
      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",
      "Traditional deterrents, like drones, dogs, falcons and even gas-powered cannons, have been used for years. But wildlife adapts quickly, and these methods don't always keep animals away for long.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How robot coyotes work to scare off birds and animals",
      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter. Future versions may include programmed routes, exclusion zones and the ability to identify specific species.

      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",
      "If you require higher levels of privacy, you can use additional client-side encryption before uploading files to Google Drive. This ensures that only you hold the decryption keys, further protecting your sensitive information.",
      "Google Drive share settings (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Internet dependency: Plan for offline access",
      "Like most cloud storage solutions, Google Drive relies on an internet connection to sync and access files. However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is Google Drive right for you?",
      "Google Drive offers strong security, seamless integration with other Google services and generous free storage. While it has some limitations as a dedicated backup solution, it remains a reliable choice for everyday file storage, sharing and collaboration. By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google Drive stands out for its convenience and integration with other Google services. However, it\u2019s important to understand both its benefits and its limitations.

It also helps the company gather valuable user feedback.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat. (Deep)",
      "How the Vanguard underwater habitat is built and tested",
      "The development of the Vanguard underwater habitat starts with dry assembly. All parts, including the wet porch and pressure vessel, are built, tested and put together on land. Then, the team conducts dry testing by pressurizing the vessel with air to check for leaks and confirm it can maintain the necessary ambient pressure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "After that, dockside testing begins. The habitat is placed in water beside a dock for gradual submersion, which makes it easy to test for water-tightness and electrical safety.",
      "Finally, the team conducts full underwater testing. In this phase, Vanguard operates on the seafloor and receives air, power, water, and communications from the surface. This final step offers key feedback on how people live and work in the habitat, helping DEEP improve Vanguard and design the larger Sentinel system.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat test schedule. (Deep)",
      "Why the Vanguard underwater habitat matters",
      "Success with the Vanguard underwater habitat will demonstrate what's achievable for underwater missions. It can reduce time, cost and weather risk for deep-sea operations. Moreover, it can unlock new discoveries beneath the waves.",

They were approaching a small fishing lake on Ridge Road when they noticed a man laying behind a light colored Ford Mustang shooting a rifle into a target on a tree about 40 yards away,\" the report reads. \"He and his son parked their car at the small lake nearby and began fishing. The man with the rifle, which he observed to be a lever action and either new or very well taken care of, came up to them and started talking to him. The man said he was bore sighting the rifle, but he wished his brother was there because he was more experienced at this. They talked of fishing, hunting and general topics. The man did not talk with an accent and gave the impression of not being from that area.",

Meyer has observed photographs of James Earl Ray and he stated that some of the photographs definitely do not look like the man he saw, but one of the photographs he recently saw in Look Magazine, the one without glasses, in some ways resembles the man he saw firing the rifle. He said he does not believe he would be able to identify the man he saw even if he saw him again,\" the report continued.",

      "\"Meyer thought nothing of the incident until he heard of the shooting of Martin Luther King. Then he thought there might possibly be some connection, but he did not report the matter to the local police because he was afraid they would only laugh at him. He said he went back to the area [where] the man was firing and was unable to find any cartridges. He looked at the tree that had been shot at and noted that the places where the bullets hit indicated that a high-powered cartridge was used,\" the report said.",

      "\"I don't think he was involved. I think he was used as a--he was used some way in it, though. I think that because, you know, of the money he spent and all that. I think his name was used, and because he couldn't turn himself in because he had so much time to do in Missouri. I think he was implicated in some way, more likely used,\" Jerry said.",
      "\"Are you saying that someone paid him to pretend to be King's murderer?\" the interviewer asked.",

      "\"Trump has changed the game,\" Peter Doran, an expert on Russia, Ukraine, and transatlantic relations, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said. \"[Then] there's Vladimir Putin, who has clearly awakened the Europeans to the danger that Russia presents to them.\"",

      "According to Huckabee, beginning in early 2025, the Interior Ministry\u2019s visa department stopped following the Ministry of Religious Affairs recommendations and began conducting its own investigations into each Christian organization to determine whether they should be recognized as \"Religious Institutions\" and remain eligible for visas.",
      "He cited as examples the Baptist Convention of Israel, Christian Missionary Alliance and Assemblies of God, noting that members of these groups have been denied renewals of their A3 clergy visas and are instead required to complete lengthy questionnaires about their religious beliefs.

      "\"It\u2019s a chronic problem, and it\u2019s disheartening,\" the source said. \"It shouldn\u2019t take the intervention of someone like Ambassador Huckabee to resolve what should be a routine bureaucratic matter.\"",
      "EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS, WHO HAVE LONG SUPPORTED ISRAEL, VISIT AS WARTIME VOLUNTEERS",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "A Republican's call to revoke New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's citizenship has raised fears about Donald Trump's use of the denaturalization process.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Immediately after Zohran Mamdani became the presumptive Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City last month, one Republican congressman had a provocative suggestion for the Trump administration: \u201cHe needs to be DEPORTED.\u201d",
      "The Uganda-born Mamdani obtained U.S. citizenship in 2018 after moving to the United States with his parents as a child. But Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., argued in his post on X that the Justice Department should consider revoking it over rap lyrics that, he said, suggested support for Hamas.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on whether it has replied to Ogles\u2019 letter, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of his claims about Mamdani, \u201cSurely if they are true, it\u2019s something that should be investigated.\u201d",
      "Trump himself has claimed without evidence that Mamdani is an illegal immigrant, and when erstwhile ally Elon Musk was asked about deporting another naturalized citizen, he suggested he would consider it.",
      "The congressman\u2019s proposal dovetails with a priority of the Trump administration to ramp up efforts to strip citizenship from other naturalized Americans. The process, known as denaturalization, has been used by previous administrations to remove terrorists and, decades ago, Nazis and communists.",
      "But the Trump DOJ\u2019s announcement last month that it would \u201cprioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings\u201d has sparked alarm among immigration lawyers and advocates, who fear the Trump administration could use denaturalization to target political opponents.",
      "Although past administrations have periodically pursued denaturalization cases, it is an area ripe for abuse, according to Elizabeth Taufa, a lawyer at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "\u201cIt can be very easily weaponized at any point,\u201d she said.",
      "Noor Zafar, an immigration lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said there is a \u201creal risk and a real threat\u201d that the administration will target people based on their political views.",
      "Asked for comment on the weaponization concerns, a Justice Department spokesperson pointed to the federal law that authorizes denaturalizations, 8 U.S.C. 1451.",
      "\u201cWe are upholding our duty as expressed in the statute,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Immigrant groups and political opponents of Trump are already outraged at the way the Trump administration has used its enforcement powers to stifle dissent in cases involving legal immigrants who do not have U.S. citizenship.",
      "ICE detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist engaged in campus protests critical of Israel, for more than 100 days before he was released. Turkish student R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was also detained for two months over her pro-Palestinian advocacy.",
      "More broadly, the administration has been accused of violating the due process rights of immigrants it has sought to rapidly deport over the objection of judges and, in cases involving alleged Venezuelan gang members and Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Supreme Court.",
      "Denaturalization cases have traditionally been rare and in past decades focused on ferreting out former Nazis who fled to the United States after World War II under false pretenses.",
      "But the approach gradually changed after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Aided by technological advances that made it easier to identify people and track them down, the number of denaturalization cases has gradually increased.",
      "It was the Obama administration that initially seized on the issue, launching what was called Operation Janus, which identified more than 300,000 cases where there were discrepancies involving fingerprint data that could indicate potential fraud.",
      "But the process is slow and requires considerable resources, with the first denaturalization as a result of Operation Janus secured during Trump\u2019s first term in January 2018.",
      "That case involved Baljinder Singh, originally from India, who had been subject to deportation but later became a U.S. citizen after assuming a different identity.",
      "In total, the first Trump administration filed 102 denaturalization cases, with the Biden administration filing 24, according to the Justice Department spokesperson, who said figures for the Obama administration were not available. The new Trump administration has already filed five. So far, the Trump administration has prevailed in one case involving a man originally from the United Kingdom who had previously been convicted of receiving and distributing child pornography. The Justice Department declined to provide information about the other new cases.",
      "Overall, denaturalization cases are brought against just a tiny proportion of the roughly 800,000 people who become naturalized citizens each year, according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u2018Willful misrepresentation\u2019",
      "The government has two ways to revoke citizenship, either through a rare criminal prosecution for fraud or via a civil claim in federal court.",
      "The administration outlined its priorities for civil enforcement in a June memo issued by Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate, which listed 10 potential grounds for targeting naturalized citizens.",
      "Examples range from \u201cindividuals who pose a risk to national security\u201d or who have engaged in war crimes or torture, to people who have committed Medicaid or Medicare fraud or have otherwise defrauded the government. There is also a broad catch-all provision that refers to \u201cany other cases ... that the division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.\u201d",
      "The denaturalization law focuses on \u201cconcealment of a material fact\u201d or \u201cwillful misrepresentation\u201d during the naturalization proceeding.",
      "The ACLU\u2019s Zafar said the memo leaves open the option for the Trump administration to at least try to target people based on their speech or associations.",
      "\u201cEven if they don\u2019t think they really have a plausible chance of succeeding, they can use it as a means to just harass people,\u201d she added.",
      "The Justice Department can bring denaturalization cases over a wide range of conduct related to the questions applicants for U.S. citizenship are asked, including the requirement that they have been of \u201cgood moral character\u201d in the preceding five years.",
      "Immigration law includes several examples of what might disqualify someone on moral character grounds, including if they are a \u201chabitual drunkard\u201d or have been convicted of illegal gambling.",
      "The naturalization application form itself asks a series of questions probing good moral character, such as whether the applicant has been involved in violent acts, including terrorism.",
      "The form also queries whether people have advocated in support of groups that support communism, \u201cthe establishment in the United States of a totalitarian dictatorship\u201d or the \u201cunlawful assaulting or killing\u201d of any U.S. official.",
      "Failure to accurately answer any of the questions or the omission of any relevant information can be grounds for citizenship to be revoked.",
      "In 2015, for example, Sammy Chang, a native of South Korea who had recently become a U.S. citizen, had his citizenship revoked in the wake of his conviction in a criminal case of trafficking women to work at a club he owned.",
      "The government said that because Chang had been engaged in the scheme during the time he was applying for naturalization, he had failed to show good moral character.",
      "But in both civil and criminal cases, the government has to reach a high bar to revoke citizenship. Among other things, it has to show that any misstatement or omission in a naturalization application was material to whether citizenship would have been granted.",
      "In civil cases, the government has to show \u201cclear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence which does not leave the issue in doubt\u201d in order to prevail.",
      "\u201cA simple game of gotcha with naturalization applicants isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d said Jeremy McKinney, a North Carolina-based immigration lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to require significant materiality for a judge to strip someone of their United States citizenship.\u201d",
      "Targeting rap lyrics",
      "In his June 26 tweet, Ogles attached a letter he sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking her to consider pursuing Mamdani\u2019s denaturalization, in part, because he \u201cexpressed open solidarity with individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses prior to becoming a U.S. citizen.\u201d",
      "Ogles cited rap lyrics that Mamdani wrote years ago in which he expressed support for the \u201cHoly Land Five.\u201d",
      "That appears to be a reference to five men involved in a U.S.-based Muslim charitable group called the Holy Land Foundation who were convicted in 2008 of providing material support to the Palestinian group Hamas. Some activists say the prosecution was a miscarriage of justice fueled by anti-Muslim sentiment following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "Ogles\u2019 office and Mamdani\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests seeking comment.",
      "Speaking on Newsmax in June, Ogles expanded on his reasons for revoking Mamdani\u2019s citizenship, suggesting the mayoral candidate had \u201cfailed to disclose\u201d relevant information when he became a citizen, including his political associations. Ogles has alleged Mamdani is a communist because of his identification as a democratic socialist, although the latter is not a communist group.",
      "The Trump administration, Ogles added, could use a case against Mamdani to \u201ccreate a template for other individuals who come to this country\u201d who, he claimed, \u201cwant to undermine our way of life.\u201d (Even if Mamdani were denaturalized, he would not, contrary to Ogles\u2019 claim, automatically face deportation, as he would most likely revert his previous status as a permanent resident.)",
      "In an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on June 29, Mamdani said calls for him to be stripped of his citizenship and deported are \u201ca glimpse into what life is like for many Muslim New Yorkers and many New Yorkers of different faiths who are constantly being told they don\u2019t belong in this city and this country that they love.\u201d",
      "Targeting Mamdani for his rap lyrics would constitute a very unusual denaturalization case, said Taufa, the immigration lawyer.",
      "But, she added, \u201cthey can trump up a reason to denaturalize someone if they want to.\u201d",
      "McKinney, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the relatively low number of denaturalization cases that are filed, including those taken up during Trump\u2019s first term, shows how difficult it is for the government to actually strip people of their citizenship.",
      "\u201cBut what they can be very successful at is continuing to create a climate of panic and anxiety and fear,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re doing that very well. So, mission accomplished in that regard.\u201d"

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia is expected to plead guilty to charges stemming from Matthew Perry's accidental overdose in 2023 in a series of cases targeting those who supplied the \"Friends\" actor with copious amounts of ketamine.",
      "Plasencia agreed last month to plead guilty to four counts of distributing ketamine and has a formal hearing on the matter in federal court on Wednesday. According to an agreement with prosecutors, Plasencia faces up to 40 years in prison and three years of supervised release.",
      "Plasencia also faces a fine of at least $2 million, the agreement states.",
      "Perry was found dead at his Pacific Palisades home on Oct. 28, 2023, in what the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's Office declared an accident from acute effects of ketamine.",
      "The \"Friends\" actor was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety, but an investigation found that Perry was seeking the drug illegally outside of his treatment.",
      "Kenneth Iwamasa, Perry's personal assistant, was one of five people charged in the actor's death. Iwamasa plead guilty in 2024 and court documents in his case revealed that Perry was experiencing an out-of-control addiction.",
      "The former assistant told authorities that Perry was introduced to Plasencia weeks before the actor died, and that the doctor sold Perry both liquid ketamine and ketamine lozenges. He also taught Iwamasa how to inject Perry, the assistant said, despite the fact that Iwamasa had no medical training.",
      "Iwamasa\u2019s plea agreement stated that Perry paid Plasencia up to $55,000 for the drug in the month prior to his death.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged in court documents that Plasencia told a patient that Perry was \u201ctoo far gone and spiraling in his addiction,\" but continued to sell him drugs anyway. Text messages between Plasencia and Mark Chavez, a former doctor who pled guilty in the Perry case, showed the men mocking how much money they could get from the actor for ketamine.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia said. \"Lets find out.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has begun announcing a suite of new bilateral trade agreements.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has begun announcing a suite of new bilateral trade agreements. The details of the deals \u2014 and who, if anyone, stands to benefit \u2014 remain largely unknown.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump heralded three new agreements with Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. The announcements came with no information about enforcement or guarantees, outside of tariff levels stated by Trump \u2014 19% for the first two, 15% for Japan \u2014 and promises of eliminating barriers on imports of U.S. products.",
      "Instead, the deals have been overshadowed by warnings from U.S. firms about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs to their bottom lines, prolonging a cloud of uncertainty over a U.S. economy already operating at stall speed.",
      "While recession odds have been dialed back in recent weeks, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal still see 33% odds of one coming within a year, compared with 22% at the start of 2025. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for the S&P 500 compiled by research group FactSet are 3% lower since then, the Journal said.",
      "And even as major stock indexes continue to churn higher to near-records, analysts say the gains are increasingly driven by an ever-narrower band of companies, like tech firms, that are largely unaffected by the tariffs. Reuters reported this week that out of 68 U.S. companies that have provided explicit reactions to tariffs, 26 have issued profit margin warnings, while 24 have announced price hikes.",
      "It is not clear how any of the new deals will improve matters. The most significant new agreement recently announced by Trump is with Japan. It imposes a 15% tax on products imported from that country, with Japan pledging to \u201copen\u201d itself to more U.S. products \u201cincluding cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products and other things.\u201d Trump also announced an unspecified investment worth $500 billion, of which the U.S. would take 90% of profits.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday the $500 billion would be able to be used for \u201canything\u201d \u2014 from manufacturing pharmaceuticals to building semiconductor factories or mining critical minerals. Japan \u201cwill finance the project and then we\u2019ll give it to an operator who will run it and the profits will be split \u2014 90% to the taxpayers of the United States and 10% to the Japanese,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked if the billions were just loan guarantees, Lutnick said it encompassed \u201cequity, loans and loan guarantees.\u201d He added that Japan would \u201cbe the banker\u201d for projects the U.S. wanted to pursue.",
      "Lutnick said the investment was proposed along with lowering tariffs to 15% because \u201cthe Japanese are never going to really open their market the way Donald Trump wants them to open it.\u201d Shortly after Lutnick made those comments on Bloomberg Television, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, saying that \u201cJapan is, for the first time ever, OPENING ITS [MARKET] TO THE USA,\u201d adding that the deal includes \u201ccars, SUV\u2019s, Trucks, -and everything else.\u201d",
      "Setting aside the contradictory remarks, the deal serves to massively increase the effective tax rate charged to companies importing Japanese products, from 2% to 15%. With most analysts agreeing that the importing firm \u2014 and, in many cases, the end consumer \u2014 ultimately pays the tariff, it translates to nearly $23 billion in lost private spending power in the U.S. economy given the approximately $150 billion worth of goods the U.S. imports from Japan.",
      "Early Wednesday, Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers expressed their concerns about the Japan deal, saying that if nothing changes, Japanese auto imports now face a lower tariff rate than those imported from Canada and Mexico, where the trio still maintain much of their production capacity. The warning came after GM announced a $1 billion hit to its profits from tariffs already being collected.",
      "\u201cAny deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high U.S. content is a bad deal for U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers,\u201d Matt Blunt, who heads the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement.",
      "Investors are also reacting, but not the way they used to.",
      "Unlike at the outset of his second term, when Trump\u2019s tariffs rollout caused one of the sharpest sell-offs in history, markets now shrug when Trump announces new deals \u2014 simultaneously waiting for the impact from tariffs to show up in the economy, while also unsure that what Trump announced will actually end up sticking.",
      "In a note to clients published Wednesday, analysts with Piper Sandler financial group said they doubt the deals being cut will last.",
      "\u201cThese deals are made under duress,\u201d they wrote. \u201cInstead of being based on fixed principles of free or fair trade \u2014 or you might say, reciprocity \u2014 these deals are all about leverage. But leverage shifts all the time.\u201d",
      "For now, they said, it is clear that any agreements Trump announces will include higher import duties.",
      "\u201cInvestors should expect higher tariffs after August 1,\u201d they wrote."

    "story": [
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., is skipping a bid for governor and will instead run for re-election after President Donald Trump urged him to do just that, giving Republicans a battle-tested incumbent in one of the most competitive House races in the country \u2014 and clearing the way for one of Lawler's House colleagues to run for governor if she so chooses.",
      "Lawler made his announcement Wednesday morning in an interview with The New York Times and an appearance on Fox News, noting that \u201ckeeping the House majority is critical\u201d and that his seat has been \u201cdeterminative of control of the House\u201d during recent elections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to run for re-election on my record and win next November and keep the House Republican majority,\u201d he said.",
      "In a post on social media, he added that he's skipping a gubernatorial bid despite the fact that \"I fundamentally believe I am best positioned to take on\" Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Republicans are protecting a narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms. Democrats would need to a net gain of just three seats to flip the chamber, and Lawler represents one of the three House Republican districts carried by then-Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "New York Republicans have been encouraged by their recent performance in statewide elections \u2014 Trump improved his vote share from 38% in 2020 to 43% in 2024, and Republican Lee Zeldin lost to Hochul by about 6 percentage points in the 2022 governor's race. It was the Republican Party' best performance in 20 years.",
      "But Democrats haven't lost a gubernatorial race since 2002, and the party is already gearing up to use Trump and the House GOP's legislative agenda against Republicans next fall.",
      "Lawler had been openly considering a gubernatorial bid for some time, but Trump endorsed him for re-election in May, before the congressman made his announcement.",
      "That endorsement came weeks after reporting that Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a Trump ally who had been tapped to become his United Nations ambassador before that nomination was pulled amid concerns about the slim GOP majority in the House, was weighing a gubernatorial bid of her own.",
      "Stefanik responded to Lawler\u2019s decision by praising the congressman's commitment to \"protecting the House Republican majority,\" adding she\u2019d announce her plans after the fall elections. Stefanik started a political action committee last month aimed at supporting \"Republican candidates across New York in 2025, and laying the groundwork to save New York by firing Kathy Hochul in 2026.\"",
      "Hochul is running for re-election and faces a primary challenge from her lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado. Addressing Lawler's decision not to run on social media, Hochul criticized Lawler for having \"caved to Trump\" by supporting the GOP's major tax cut and spending bill, and posting a photo of a box of dog bones, calling Lawler \"Donald Trump's Good Boy.\"",
      "Lawler\u2019s decision helps House Republicans defend their narrow majority next year, as they\u2019ll be able to rally behind the incumbent in a difficult district that Harris narrowly won in 2024. But Lawler is expected to face significant competition as Democrats look to win back control of the House."

      "In the Apple TV+ show \u201cAcapulco,\u201d M\u00e1ximo Gallardo was first introduced to viewers as the symbol of the American dream \u2014 a young, working-class hotel worker in Mexico who ultimately becomes a multimillionaire with a big mansion in Malibu, California.",
      "But Eugenio Derbez \u2014 star and executive producer of the bilingual hit series \u2014 wants viewers to remember M\u00e1ximo in the show's fourth and final season as a dreamer who also represents the moxie and creativity of hardworking Mexicans.",
      "\u201cI want \u2018Acapulco\u2019 to be remembered as a vibrant, bilingual series that celebrated Mexican culture with warmth, humor, and authenticity,\u201d Derbez said via email in an interview with NBC News. \u201cFor American audiences, I hope it reshapes perceptions: that Mexico is more than headlines \u2014 it\u2019s rich in identity, beauty, resilience, and heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not modeled after one real figure,\u201d Derbez said about M\u00e1ximo, adding that his character's ambition and business instincts resonate with many self-made entrepreneurs in Mexico \u2014 people who work tirelessly to build something lasting.\u201d",
      "Viewers first met M\u00e1ximo in season one as he started to tell the  story of himself as a young, energetic pool boy at the glamorous resort of Las Colinas in Acapulco, Mexico. (The young M\u00e1ximo is played by Enrique Arriz\u00f3n).",
      "Now in season four, M\u00e1ximo is poised to reopen the hotel as its new owner, and restore the legacy that made Acapulco an international destination for the rich and famous.",
      "Hollywood legends Rita Hayworth, Errol Flynn and Orson Welles first made Acapulco popular for Americans in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and even the Flintstones expanded that Riviera fame in the 1960s. It wasn't just Americans who put Acapulco on the map \u2014 but Mexican icons such as comedic genius Cantinflas and Grammy-winning pop singer Luis Miguel also made the city a household name for Spanish speakers all over the world.",
      "Off screen, M\u00e1ximo can mirror the tenacity and ambition of Derbez, who established himself as a one-man-show \u2014 writing, producing, directing and acting \u2014 in multiple series for Mexican television before moving to Hollywood.",
      "In the U.S., Derbez transitioned successfully to the big screen, starring in 2011 with Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes and Al Pacino in the comedy \u201cJack and Jill.\u201d In 2012, he was featured with Eva Mendes, Matthew Modine and Patricia Arquette in \u201cGirl in Progress.\u201d",
      "But his big break happened in 2013 with \u201cInstructions Not Included,\u201d in which Derbez demonstrated some of that M\u00e1ximo moxie: The comedy about a Mexican playboy forced to raise his small daughter that he wrote, produced, directed and starred in became the highest Spanish-language box office hit of all time\u2014grossing over $100 million worldwide.",
      "Since then, Derbez has had other successes with \u201cHow to Be a Latin Lover\u201d and \u201cOverboard.\u201d And in 2021, he played a music teacher in \u201cCODA,\u201d which won the Oscar for best picture.",
      "In 2023, Derbez challenged viewers with another heartfelt story about Mexico. He produced and starred in the Spanish-language comedy-drama movie \u201cRadical.\u201d The film was inspired by a 12-year-old Mexican girl who was featured on the cover of Wired magazine in 2013 as \u201cThe Next Steve Jobs.\u201d",
      "Now, with \u201cAcapulco\u201d kicking off its last season Wednesday, Derbez is looking for other ways to tell authentic dreamer stories.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, I\u2019d love to explore more stories from Mexico\u2014and even stories from other Latin American countries that deserve global representation,\u201d he said.",
      "Derbez is proud of \u201cAcapulco\u201d because it represents Mexican culture \u201cwithout stereotypes.\u201d And while Hollywood has made progress telling diverse stories, he calls on the industry for more work to be done.",
      "\u201cI think we need to go beyond token gestures. Putting a Latino actor in a supporting role doesn\u2019t automatically make a project inclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue inclusion begins when we tell stories about Latinos \u2014 stories that are authentic, layered, and compelling. Stories that don\u2019t just resonate with Latino audiences, but with the entire world.\u201d",
      "And this, Derbez says, is what viewers can see in \u201cAcapulco.\u201d",

      "The former motel manager was convicted in 1997 of commissioning the murder of his former boss Barry Van Treese, the owner of a motel in Oklahoma City. Glossip has maintained his innocence.",

      "In the Supreme Court's majority ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that prosecutors \"knew Sneed\u2019s statements were false\" and that \u201cbecause Sneed\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence of Glossip's guilt of capital murder, the jury\u2019s assessment of Sneed's credibility was necessarily determinative here.\"",
      "\"Hence, there is a reasonable likelihood that correcting Sneed\u2019s testimony would have affected the judgment of the jury,\" she wrote.",

      "\"He had nine execution dates, three last meals, and obviously, to finally get relief has been huge for him, and he\u2019s thrilled beyond words,\u201d Knight said at the time.",
      "Since the ruling, Glossip has been removed from death row and held without bail in the Oklahoma County Detention Center.",
      "The court\u2019s ruling came several years after a group of bipartisan Oklahoma lawmakers championed Glossip\u2019s innocence, commissioning an independent report in his defense.",
      "The 2022 report concluded that \u201cno reasonable jury hearing the complete record would convict Glossip of first-degree murder.\u201d",
      "The latest twist in Glossip's case came last month when Oklahoma State Attorney General Gentner Drummond said that he intends to pursue a new murder trial against Glossip on a first-degree murder charge.",
      "\"While it was clear to me and to the U.S. Supreme Court that Mr. Glossip did not receive a fair trial, I have never proclaimed his innocence,\" Drummond said in a statement at the time. \"After the high court remanded the matter back to district court, my office thoroughly reviewed the merits of the case against Richard Glossip and concluded that sufficient evidence exists to secure a murder conviction.\"",
      "Drummond added that he would seek a life sentence for Glossip rather than the death penalty.",
      "The state attorney general's office did not immediately return a request for comment."

      "Abrego\u2019s attorney Sean Hecker wrote in the latest filing: \"These comments \u2014 made by a sitting cabinet secretary (and one of the Nation\u2019s highest ranking law enforcement officials) in this District, mere miles from the courthouse where Mr. Abrego\u2019s case is pending\u2014 are precisely of the type that are most likely to prejudice Mr. Abrego\u2019s right to a fair trial.\"",
      "\"Secretary Noem assailed Mr. Abrego\u2019s character and reputation, including with verbal insults and allegations that are irrelevant to the offenses charged in the indictment and almost certainly inadmissible at trial,\" he continued.",
      "The attorney argued that Noem went out of her way to make the remarks to local press, and the statements \"are not just highly likely to taint the jury pool; they appear calculated to maximize the prejudice to Mr. Abrego.\"",
      "On July 21, the defense had requested that the government issue a retraction, but the Trump administration did not respond to that request.",
      "The court had already ordered both the government and defense to stop making public statements about Abrego\u2019s case to ensure a fair trial on July 3.",
      "The new filing asks Judge Crenshaw to clarify the requirements of Local Criminal Rule 2.01 in Tennessee, which says a lawyer participating in an investigation or litigation must not make extrajudicial statements that could prejudice a proceeding.",
      "\"In light of the July 18 press conference, Mr. Abrego also requests that this Court order the government to notify all officials at DHS that are involved in the investigation of Mr. Abrego, and all officials in their supervisory chain, of the requirement to comply with this Court\u2019s rules regarding extrajudicial statements,\" the filing said.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the Department of Justice and DHS for comment.",
      "Abrego, 29, was deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador in March. The Trump administration later said he was deported in an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d His deportation was in direct violation of a judge\u2019s order in 2019 that was issued to prevent Abrego's deportation to El Salvador, where he was born and claimed to have been in danger of gang violence.",
      "He was brought back to the U.S. in June after a high-profile back-and-forth between his attorneys and the federal government. The Trump administration doubled down in painting Abrego as a gang member \u2014 claims he denies.",
      "Upon his return to the U.S., he was charged with two federal felonies in the U.S. District Court in Nashville: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to those charges."

      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to the Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy.

      "Aside from a plug-in fly trap or drain cleaner, a fly ribbon is also quite effective in trapping flies. These ribbons, which have a 4-star average rating from over 12,000 reviews on Amazon, use a subtle scent to attract flies and the adhesive on them keeps them in place. They expand into a long spiraled ribbon, which  you can attach to a wall, windowsill or door, according to the brand. All you have to do is place in an area that gets a good amount of natural light, which is more likely to attract flies and other pests.",
      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "How we tested the best mineral sunscreens for dark skin",
      "Our NBC Select staff tested over 100 sunscreens for six weeks to find the very best formulas for summer (and beyond). While testing, we tried dozens of mineral sunscreens and of those, we found some brown skin-friendly formulas for different skin types and activities. We tested on a range of brown skin tones and skin types, including dry, oily, sensitive and acne-prone skin, and wore the sunscreens to work, to the gym, outdoors, and more. Here is some of the key criteria we kept in mind while testing:",

      "When a sunscreen claims to have a \u201cuniversal tint\u201d, my guard automatically goes up, but Herbivore\u2019s Star Seed sunscreen proved my doubts wrong. It\u2019s formulated to work with all skin types, hydrates the skin\u2019s moisture barrier with prebiotics, and evens skin tone with vitamin C, according to the brand. It has a creamy texture that feels more like a primer than sunscreen, and a light, orange-ish tint. Although I can\u2019t speak to exactly how universal the tint is, the sunscreen absorbs within minutes and gives me zero white cast while blending really well into my skin. I also love how well it holds up on my oilier skin \u2014 even on my shiniest days, the most I\u2019ll get is a soft glow as my oil starts to break through after a few hours of wear. The sunscreen can also double as a primer.",

NBC Select commerce editor Cory Fernandez was also initially worried by the sunscreen\u2019s subtle tint, but says it blended into his skin and around his facial hair perfectly within a few minutes, sans white cast. It has a very fluid, lightweight texture that sits on your skin without feeling too heavy, and is gentle enough to use on sensitive skin. Fernandez, who has combination skin, likes that it doesn't cause irritation or burn his eyes while walking outside.  I especially recommend this sunscreen for anyone with drier skin, since it\u2019s full of hydrators, including hyaluronic acid and niacinamide.",

He also likes that it didn\u2019t leave much of a cast over his facial hair, which he says has been an issue with other formulas he\u2019s tried, and that the sunscreen didn\u2019t run white during his sweaty, intensive tennis games. Alabi, who\u2019s used and loved Dr. Loretta\u2019s products in the past, says the sunscreen\u2019s light, moisturizer-like texture is one of the few American formulas that doesn\u2019t leave her greasy.

      "Choose sunscreens with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30, which the Skin Cancer Foundation says protects against 97% of the sun\u2019s rays.For oily or acne-prone skin, be sure to check for \u201cnoncomedogenic\u201d labels, which means the product doesn\u2019t contain ingredients that are more likely to clog pores, like mineral oil or petroleum.For dry skin, keep an eye out for hydrating formulas that include ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, aloe vera and more.If you\u2019ll be swimming or sweating, choose sunscreens labeled as water-resistant, with at least 40 minutes of resistance for good measure.Lastly, to avoid a white cast, look for lightweight, sheerer formulas that are more likely to seamlessly absorb into your skin (and always check reviews).",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Mineral sunscreens typically leave a white cast because of key active ingredients zinc oxide and titanium oxide, which tend to reflect light in a way that leads to a white-ish finish, especially on darker skin. The ingredients themselves are also naturally white, which is why many mineral options come in tinted versions to help counteract the ingredients\u2019 powdery coloring.",
      "Mineral sunscreens are sometimes referred to as physical sunscreens, because they sit on the skin and shield it physically from UV rays, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, penetrate the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, to absorb UV rays like a sponge.",
      "In a word \u2014 yes. There\u2019s a huge misconception that those with darker skin don\u2019t need sunscreen, which is largely due in part to inaccuracies about the protection that melanin provides. Though melanin, which is the pigment that determines your skin color, naturally provides sun protection, it\u2019s very minimal \u2014 meaning that regardless of skin color, you absolutely still need to use sunscreen.",
      "Dermatologists and estheticians have told us multiple times that sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours, no matter your skin tone. If you\u2019re using a water- or sweat-proof formula, check the suggested reapplication times, which tend to last a bit under two hours in the 40-80 minute range.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m an associate SEO reporter for NBC Select, covering skin care and wellness topics like sunscreens for dark skin and acne spot treatments. For this piece, myself and the NBC select staff tested dozens of mineral sunscreens to find the formulas that work best for dark skin.",

      "How to shop for plastic food container alternatives",
      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "As mentioned, Osbourne had been living with Parkinson\u2019s disease for years before his death.

      "So, he focused on preparing his body for his last performance with Black Sabbath, the group\u2019s first in 20 years. Ahead of the show, he spoke to British newspaper The Guardian via video call about training for the show and how he struggled over recent years.",
      "He described his recent years as \u201cthe worst of my life\u201d amid his health issues. \u201cHow many surgeries have I had?\u201d he asked himself, referring to the multiple procedures he had since falling on his face in January 2019. \u201cI\u2019ve got more f---ing metal in me than a scrap merchants.\u201d",
      "To get ready for his last time on stage, he started lifting weights, bike riding and working with a trainer. \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2014 I\u2019ve been laid up for such a long time. I\u2019ve been lying on my back doing nothing and the first thing to go is your strength. It\u2019s like starting all over again,\u201d he said.",
      "Osbourne continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got a vocal coach coming round four days a week to keep my voice going. I have problems walking. I also get blood pressure issues, from blood clots on my legs. I\u2019m used to doing two hours on stage, jumping and running around. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be doing much jumping or running around this time. I may be sitting down, but the point is I\u2019ll be there, and I\u2019ll do the best I can. So all I can do is turn up.\u201d",
      "He was also asked during the interview if he was sure that the Birmingham gig would be his last.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to say \u2018never say never\u2019, but after the last six years or so \u2026 it is time,\u201d he said. \u201cI lived on the road for 50-odd years, and I\u2019ve kind of got used to not picking up my bags and getting on the bus again. I don\u2019t smoke dope or do any of the rock star lifestyle anymore. I\u2019m kind of like a homebody. I never go out. I never hang out in bars \u2014 I don\u2019t drink. So what the f--- is out there for me?\u201d",

      "\u201cI hate going shopping with my wife. I feel like stabbing myself in the neck after half an hour. But it\u2019s time for me to spend some time with my grandkids, I don\u2019t want to die in a hotel room somewhere. I want to spend the rest of my life with my family,\u201d he said."

      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Bana called the show a \u201ccharacter-driven murder mystery,\u201d appearing to be exhausted recalling all that Kyle endures throughout the course of the six episodes.",
      "\u201cIn the end, I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, how much more can this character take?\u2019\u201d Bana says.",
      "Who Is Jane Doe in \u2018Untamed\u2019?",
      "Naya uncovers Jane Doe's identity through a detailed photo search paired with DNA testing. The former Los Angeles Police Department officer-turned-park ranger identifies Jane Doe as Lucy Cook, a girl who went missing in the park in 2012.",
      "Based on Lucy\u2019s wounds discovered post mortem, Kyle and Naya reason that she was likely running from someone when she arrived at the top of the mountain. Meanwhile, the mystery of her disappearance as a child remains.",
      "Initially, Kyle believes Lucy's father, Rory, was responsible for her death, until it's revealed he had been killed three years prior. Then, DNA evidence shows Rory wasn't even Lucy's biological father.",
      "Kyle learns Lucy was once in the foster care system and went on the run from a problematic home.",
      "What Happened to Caleb in \u2018Untamed\u2019?",
      "The story of the young girl's death hit close to home for Kyle. Just five years earlier, he and now-ex wife Jill Bodwin (Rosemarie DeWitt) lost their son, Caleb, who was murdered in the park.",
      "Caleb appears to Kyle as apparitions throughout the show, seemingly guiding him through the investigation. But it's not until the final episode of the show that viewers know who killed Caleb and why his death tore apart Kyle and Jill's marriage.",
      "Seemingly in the background of the Jane Doe case, Kyle is occasionally questioned about a wrongful death lawsuit for a man named Sean Sanderson. Though he acts na\u00efve to Sean's identity and the reason for his death, the finale reveals that Kyle and Jill both know how he died.",
      "As told in the final episode, Sean killed Caleb, and Jill hired the park\u2019s wildlife management officer, Shane Maguire (Wilson Bethel), to kill Sean.",
      "Jill initially kept her plan from Kyle until Sean was killed, which they suggest caused them to separate.",
      "Who Killed Lucy Cook in \u2018Untamed\u2019?",
      "As Kyle comes closer to cracking the case of Lucy's death, chief park ranger Paul Souter (Sam Neill) begins urging him to drop the investigation.",
      "Determined to see this case to the end, Kyle finds Lucy's final foster home, where she was dropped off by a man claiming to be her dad and whom she described as a police officer.",
      "Putting the pieces together, Kyle returns to Yosemite and confronts Paul with what he's heard. In a dramatic confession, Paul, who was married, reveals that he had an affair with Lucy's mother, which he hid for decades. Paul tells Kyle that he brought Lucy to the Nevada foster home to remove her from a violent situation with her mom's husband, Rory.",
      "Paul says he hadn't seen Lucy since he dropped her off, until about a year ago when she began blackmailing and extorting money from him, threatening to tell his family he had a secret daughter.",
      "At one point, Paul says Lucy attempted to run away with his other daughter, Sadie, while threatening to reveal his covert life. Paul says he brought Sadie home, but then went after Lucy, chasing her up the mountain.",
      "Paul tells Kyle he fired a shot at Lucy \u2014 not to kill her, but to get her attention for them to talk. After being shot in the leg, Lucy made her way to the edge of the mountain and jumped.",
      "When asked what was likely going through Kyle\u2019s head during Paul\u2019s confession, Bana tells TODAY.com: \u201cShock.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s pieced together a lot of it, but then to hear Paul confess to all that is biggest gut punch for him imaginable,\u201d Bana says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, what else can this character experience? It\u2019s just so hard,\u201d he adds.",
      "How Does \u2018Untamed\u2019 End?",
      "After the confession, Kyle tells Paul that he must to report who's responsible for Lucy's death, and that this could be Paul's chance to make things right.",
      "Paul then pulls a gun on Kyle, who looks but continues to walk away. As Kyle leaves, Paul shoots himself in the head and falls into the river below them.",
      "From Kyle\u2019s perspective, Bana describes Paul as \u201cthe only character that Kyle really respects and listens to.\u201d So when it came to choosing between keeping his friend\u2019s secret and doing his job, Bana says Kyle\u2019s trauma could have played a role.",
      "\u201cI think when someone\u2019s damaged or been through so much trauma in their own life, maybe there\u2019s a kind of level of them having such a thick skin,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that keeps him going is to do his job well and properly, and to ensure that the law is upheld, and things are done morally correct.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of what\u2019s keeping him alive himself,\u201d Bana continues of Kyle. \u201cSo, it\u2019s almost like a survival mechanism to just continue with the task. And the fact that it means that one of his closest friends is going to have to face up to what he\u2019s done, that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d",
      "At the end of the series, Kyle leaves Yosemite, seemingly moving on from his role as a special agent. He leaves a horse behind for Naya and a box of Caleb's toy cars for her son.",
      "Seen driving through the mountains and pine trees out of Yosemite, the show never reveals Kyle's next destination, though he appears to be at peace with his decision.",
      "\u201cI like it because we get a sense of the character having some closure, but not complete closure at all,\u201d Bana says of Kyle\u2019s decision to leave the park.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s been convinced that spiritually, he can carry whatever he\u2019s carrying with him to another location that it doesn\u2019t have to be physically rooted in this particular location and park, and his connection to his son will always be there.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "One Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader is breaking the mold with her signature hairstyle, and it's causing quite the stir.",
      "When rookie Faith Ward recently announced that she'd earned a spot on the 2025-2026 DCC squad, some social media users noticed that her hair looked a bit different than the rest of the cheerleaders.",
      "In \"America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,\" the members of the iconic squad are typically seen wearing their hair down, with lots of volume.",
      "However, Ward was spotted rocking a perky ponytail while sporting the DCC uniform in multiple TikTok and Instagram posts.",
      "Now, the New Zealander is addressing the question on everyone\u2019s mind: Will the ponytail stick around?",
      "During a July 21 interview with ABC Perth, Ward said she understands why people have been curious to know whether she's allowed to wear a different hairstyle than the rest of the squad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because obviously the DCC hairstyle is hair out, fluffy, voluminous, luscious, long locks. I\u2019ve, you know, broken that stereotype,\u201d she said.",
      "The cheerleader then explained how the ponytail hairstyle came about in the first place.",
      "\u201cSo, I\u2019m in rehearsal one of the days with my hair out and I am, you know, sweating after doing \u2018Thunderstruck.' (DCC Director Kelli Finglass is) looking at me and she\u2019s like, \u2018You know what? I really want to see what your hair would look like tied up,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "The change helped Ward focus more on her choreography and resulted in an unexpected, yet positive perk.",
      "\u201cSo I put it up for her and she really liked the way it danced, which was really cool because I was super excited about that because your girl doesn\u2019t want to have her hair out, sweaty in her face (while) dancing,\u201d she said.",
      "When Ward went to uniform fittings, she kept her hair in the ponytail \"in hopes that\" Kelli Finglass would like it. Luckily, she did.",
      "\u201cI walk in and she goes, \u2018You\u2019re giving Ariana Grande! Like, we need an Ariana Grande moment on the team,\u201d she said of Finglass' reaction. \"I was like, \u2018Are you serious right now, Kelli? Like this is so exciting!\u2019 She was like, \u2018Yeah, but I want your ponytail longer, I want it blonder and then I want to see a cameo day (to determine) whether I prefer you with your hair out or in a ponytail.\u201d",
      "Moving forward, Ward still isn't positive that the hairstyle will stick around, but she's cautiously optimistic.",
      "\u201cSo right now, it\u2019s looking very hopeful that I will be a DCC with a ponytail. But, we still have to keep an open mind to the possibility that I could be going back to be hair out. So we can\u2019t get too excited yet!\u201d she said.",
      "Second-year DCC veteran Ava Lahey also recently opened up about her hair, which she wears straight instead of curly. In an Instagram video posted on June 27, she said her hair is \"naturally really soft and fine\" and used to \"fall flat after 20 minutes and look really stringy\" when she curled it during training camp.",
      "Similar to Ward, Lahey was told her hair \"dances better\" when she wears it straight.",
      "\u201cI did end up getting cut from training camp that year, but when I made it back to training camp again, I wore it straight right off the bat,\u201d she said.",
      "During the makeover phase, Lahey was told her hair looked great \"straight, sleek and blonde\" and she was \"so happy.\""

      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria.

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a response to the criticisms.",

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

So they feel free to behave as they want,\u201d he added."

      "Syria's leader accused Israel on Thursday of sowing discord with a wave of intense airstrikes following deadly sectarian clashes that threatened the country's fragile unity and illustrated its neighbor's capacity to attack across the region.",
      "In a televised speech, interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa promised to protect the rights and freedom of Syria's Druze community \u2014 and avoid an \u201copen war\u201d with Israel. He said Syria \"will never be a place for division or fragmentation.\"",
