      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival in southwest England is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before it takes a year off to allow the farmland to recover",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Glastonbury Festival is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before taking one of its regular fallow years off to allow the southwest England farmland where the music fest takes place to recover after hosting some 200,000 revelers.",
      "Festival organizers announced the lineup on Thursday, including the headline acts, for arguably the world\u2019s most famous music festival. This year, it will take place at Worthy Farm from June 25 to June 29.",
      "The main news is that English band The 1975 will headline the main Pyramid Stage on the festival's Friday night, while American singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo will take top billing on the Sunday evening.",
      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",
      "There are no scheduled performers on the festivals first two days, Wednesday and Thursday, though many ad hoc events take place as attendees arrive and pitch up their tents.",
      "A lot of interest will focus on Manchester-formed The 1975, which is fronted by Matty Healy. The band has headlined various festivals in the United Kingdom \u2014 but not Glastonbury \u2014 and elsewhere, with controversial stage antics.",
      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "NEW YORK -- She was the first to go \u201cSOLO.\u201d",
      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music. On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",
      "On \u201cRuby,\u201d it's strongest on the singles \u201cMantra,\" where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: \u201cPretty girls don\u2019t do drama \u2019less we wanna / it\u2019ll be depending on the day\" atop brassy production perfect for primetime commercial placement. Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Lady Gaga rediscovered her passion for music through self-discovery, channeling her personal transformation into her new album \u201cMayhem.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself.",
      "But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins.",
      "In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, \u201cMayhem,\u201d which is being released Friday.",
      "\u201cI reclaimed myself as an artist,\u201d said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year\u2019s \u201c Harlequin,\u201d a jazz-inspired companion album for the film \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200.",
      "But Gaga's singles for the 14-track \u201cMayhem\u201d have been received well on the charts, including \u201c Disease,\u201d \u201c Abracadabra \u201d and \u201c Die With a Smile,\u201d a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month.",
      "While recording \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys \u2014 including a tribute song \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with \u201cAll I Need is Time\u201d and delivered a surprise performance singing \u201cHold My Hand\u201d before the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana Beach in May.",
      "\u201cI built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,\u201d said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Polansky, 41, on \u201cMayhem.\u201d \u201cWhen my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on \u201cSaturday Night Live\" on Saturday.",
      "While Gaga was dropping early hits like \u201cJust Dance\u201d and \u201cPoker Face,\u201d she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists.",
      "With \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation.",
      "\u201cThey tried to qualify and quantify me,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You\u2019re a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions.\u201d",
      "When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character",
      "\u201cThis was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn\u2019t. That it was the real me,\u201d she said. \"I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity.",
      "The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records.",
      "Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free.",
      "\u201cI lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,\" Gaga said. \"Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs.",
      "It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry.",
      "\u201cThis is the first day I\u2019ve done interviews without makeup on, and it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I\u2019m not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist.\u201d",
      "In her appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show\u2019s sketch comedy skits.",
      "\u201cI get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,\u201d said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as \u201cSNL\u201d host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013.",
      "Gaga performed during the \u201c SNL50: The Homecoming Concert \u201d last month.",
      "\u201cDoing \u2018SNL\u2019 is all about hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home.\u201d",
      "To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be like really close with the cast,\u201d she said. \u201cThey write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be.\u201d",
      "Gaga added: \u201cI\u2019m treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There\u2019s hosting and then there\u2019s being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I\u2019m ready to do it though.\u201d"

      "The Ayers family said in a Facebook post that he died Tuesday in New York City after suffering from a long illness. \u201cHe lived a beautiful 84 years and will be sorely missed,\u201d it said.",
      "Ayers had 12 albums land in the Billboard 200 album charts, the highest being \u201cYou Send Me\u201d in 1978 at No. 48. His \u201cThe Best of Roy Ayers\u201d spend 50 weeks on the Contemporary Jazz Album chart.",
      "His music never went out of style, appearing in the 2019 \u201cQueen & Slim: The Soundtrack.\u201d His song \u201cRunning Away\u201d propelled A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s 1989 opus \u201cDescription of a Fool,\u201d and the song was sampled by Big Daddy Kane and Common. Ayers was heard on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s album \u201cCherry Bomb\u201d and Erykah Badu's \u201cMama\u2019s Gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, I have more sampled hits than anybody,\" he said in a 2004 interview with Wax Poetics magazine. \"I might not have more samples than James Brown, but I\u2019ve had more sampled hits. Oh, man, and there\u2019s a few I don\u2019t know about.\u201d",
      "One of Ayers' most popular albums was \"Lifeline,\" which peaked at No. 9 on what has become the Top R&B/Hip-hop chart in 1977 and contained the hit \u201cRunning Away,\u201d which peaked at No. 19 on the R&B chart and became a massive club hit.",
      "During a visit to Johannesburg in 2017, Ayers offered some rhythmic advice for youth in the city's Soweto area: Get serious, be inspired, rap on, keep on and \u201ceventually you\u2019ll get it.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou guys, you have to pick your plateau. Get serious about everything,\u201d said Ayers. He also named a few musicians who have inspired him: Nigerian Fela Kuti (\u201che was really like a genius\u201d), Herbie Mann (\u201che taught me the business\u201d) and Miles Davis (\u201cHe was the coolest. He was the grandmaster. He was out of sight\u201d).",
      "After debuting on record with hard bop tenor saxophonist Curtis Amy\u2019s group in 1962, he teamed with jazz flutist Mann to record three albums for Atlantic Records \u2014 \u201cVirgo Vibes,\u201d \u201cStoned Soul Picnic\u201d and \u201cDaddy Bug\u201d \u2014 and wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film \u201cCoffy\u201d starring Pam Grier. He also moved on to work with David \u201cFathead\u201d Newman, the tenor mainstay of Ray Charles\u2019 great \u201960s orchestra.",
      "In 2017, he appeared alongside such acts as Tom Petty, the Shins, Alabama Shakes, Charles Bradley and William Bell at the eclectic Arroyo Seco Festival in Los Angeles.",

      "He died Sunday in Lakeland, Florida, two of his business representatives said. Lowe had been struggling to recover from elective heart surgery in November, his family said in a statement. \u201cOver the past few months, his family and friends have been by his side in support and care for him,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Lowe's booming voice and off-the-wall humor turned \u201cSpace Ghost Coast to Coast\u201d into a cult classic among young adults and teens.",
      "The show debuted in 1994 and aired for more than a decade on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim nighttime programming block.

While the interviews with the likes of William Shatner, Conan O'Brien and Donny Osmond were pre-recorded, Lowe would later add wacky and rambling digressions, such as asking guests if they were getting enough oxygen.",
      "\u201cInsanity became en vogue, thanks to us,\u201d Lowe told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2004.",
      "Adult Swim President Michael Ouweleen said the show proved the network could find success with its own productions.",

      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "Olivia Wilde wore a sheer lace negligee",
      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- At the Oscars ceremony, they were there. At the after-parties, they were barely there.",
      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Polish abortion rights activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw on Saturday where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.",
      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",
      "Activists with the group Abortion Dream Team say it is the first stationary abortion center in Poland. It is meant to offer support to women who prefer not to have abortions alone in their bathrooms at home.",
      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",
      "The country's centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, came to power in an election in 2023 in which he vowed to liberalize the country's abortion law. But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",
      "Last year he acknowledged that he lacks the backing in parliament to change the law. Allowing abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy had been one of his campaign promises."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",

      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",

      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",

      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment.

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",

      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",

      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",

      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health is facing questions from a Senate panel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A health economist who famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health faces Senate questioning Wednesday on his nomination to head that agency.",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",
      "He \u201chas a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate health committee considering the nomination, wrote on X after meeting with Bhattacharya last month.",
      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",
      "Bhattacharya holds a medical degree but is not a practicing physician. His own research on the economics of health care has been funded by the NIH.",

      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The administration\u2019s unprecedented moves are upending the research engine that has made the U.S. \u201cthe envy of the world in terms of scientific innovation,\u201d said Georgetown University health policy expert Lawrence Gostin.",
      "Among the biggest blows, if it survives a court challenge: Massive cuts in funding from the National Institutes of Health that would cost jobs in every state, according to an analysis by The Associated Press with assistance from the nonprofit United for Medical Research.",
      "That\u2019s on top of mass firings of government workers, NIH delays in issuing grants and uncertainty about how many already funded studies are being canceled under the president's anti-diversity executive orders.",
      "Earlier this week, lawmakers pressured Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the nominee to become NIH director, about the turmoil. Bhattacharya said if confirmed, he'd look into it to ensure scientists employed by and funded by the agency \u201chave resources to do the lifesaving work they do.\u201d",
      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",

      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",

Thousands of young men and women from Asia, Europe and Africa released from modern day slavery are now waiting in an indefinite limbo at repurposed scam centers and army camps controlled by armed militia groups as the first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa. No disease is deadlier on the continent, especially for children. But the Trump administration's decision to terminate 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts has local health officials warning of catastrophe in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Dr. Jimmy Opigo, who runs Uganda\u2019s malaria control program, told The Associated Press that USAID stop-work orders issued in late January left him and others \u201cfocusing on disaster preparedness.\u201d The U.S. is the top bilateral funder of anti-malaria efforts in Africa.",
      "Anti-malarial medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets to help control the mosquito-borne disease are \u201clike our groceries,\u201d Opigo said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be continuous supply.\u201d",
      "As those dwindle with the U.S.-terminated contracts, he expects a rise in cases later this year of severe malaria, which includes problems like organ failure. There is no cure. Vaccines being rolled out in parts of Africa are imperfect but are expected to largely continue with the support of a global vaccine alliance.",
      "The Washington-based Malaria No More says new modeling shows that just a year of disruption in the malaria-control supply chain would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally. It has urged the Trump administration to \u201crestart these life-saving programs before outbreaks get out of hand.\u201d",
      "Africa's 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Health workers in the three African nations most burdened by malaria \u2014 Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 described a cascade of effects with the end of most U.S. government support.",
      "The U.S. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the three countries alone through the USAID-led President\u2019s Malaria Initiative.",
      "The U.S. funding has often been channeled through a web of non-governmental organizations, medical charities and faith-based organizations in projects that made malaria prevention and treatment more accessible, even free, especially for rural communities.",
      "Uganda in 2023 had 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths, many of them children under 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Opigo said the U.S. has been giving between $30 million and $35 million annually for malaria control. He didn't say which contracts have been terminated but noted that field research was also affected.",
      "Some of the USAID funding in Uganda paid for mosquito-spraying operations in remote areas. Those operations were supposed to begin in February ahead of the rainy season, when stagnant water becomes breeding ground for the wide-ranging anopheles mosquito. They have been suspended.",
      "\u201cWe have to spray the houses before the rains, when the mosquitoes come to multiply,\u201d Opigo said.",
      "Already, long lines of malaria patients can be seen outside clinics in many areas every year. Malaria accounts for 30% to 50% of outpatient visits to health facilities across the country, according to Uganda National Institute of Public Health.",
      "Nigeria records a quarter of the world's malaria cases. But authorities have reduced malaria-related deaths there by 55% since 2000 with the support of the U.S. and others.",
      "That support is part of the $600 million in health assistance the west African country received from the U.S. in 2023, according to U.S. Embassy figures. It was not immediately clear whether all of that funding has stopped.",
      "The President\u2019s Malaria Initiative has supported Nigeria\u2019s malaria response with nearly 164 million fast-acting medicines, 83 million insecticide-treated bed nets, over 100 million rapid diagnostic tests, 22 million preventive treatments in pregnancy and insecticide for 121,000 homes since 2011, the embassy says.",
      "In Congo, U.S government funding has contributed about $650 million towards malaria control since 2010.",
      "Now, some of the successes in fighting malaria in Congo are being threatened, which will complicate already difficult efforts to identify and track disease outbreaks across the vast country as supplies and expertise for malaria testing are affected.",
      "Worsening conflict in Congo's east, where some health workers have fled, has raised the risk of infection, with little backup coming.",
      "With the loss of substantial U.S. support, \u201ca lot of people are going to be affected. Some people are really poor and cannot afford (malaria treatment),\u201d said Dr. Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo, a Nigerian who runs the Market Doctors nonprofit providing affordable local healthcare services.",
      "Up to 40% of her organization's clients are diagnosed with malaria, Ayo-Oyalowo said.",
      "There is hope among health workers in Africa that, even after the dismantling of USAID, some U.S. funding will continue flowing via other groups including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. But that group also received U.S. support and has not issued a public statement on the dramatic cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Opigo in Uganda said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health might be sources of help.",
      "But he added: \u201cWe need to manage the relationship with the U.S. very carefully.\"",

      "TV footage showed Yoon waving his hand, clenching his fists and bowing deeply to his supporters who were shouting his name and waving South Korean and U.S. national flags. He climbed into a black van to travel to his presidential residence in Seoul.",
      "In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he \u201cappreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul Central District Court to correct illegality,\u201d in an apparent reference to questions over his arrest. He said he also thanks his supporters and asked those who are on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.",
      "Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into huge political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",
      "The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Friday it accepted Yoon\u2019s request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations on the president. Yoon\u2019s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "Yoon\u2019s release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is canceled by a court.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon\u2019s Dec. 14 impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors\u2019 decision, calling them \u201chenchmen\u201d of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.",
      "At the heart of public criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree was his dispatch of hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after placing the country under military rule. Some senior military and police officials sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to pull out lawmakers to thwart a parliamentary vote on the decree. Yoon has countered that he aimed to maintain order.",

      "Investigators have alleged Yoon\u2019s martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he\u2019s convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that doesn't cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.",
      "Yoon has said he didn\u2019t intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "South Korea's conservative-liberal divide is severe, and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon's impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes, the division is certain to worsen.",

      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow.

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Foreign ministers from Muslim nations on Saturday rejected calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population and backed a plan for an administrative committee of Palestinians to govern the territory to allow reconstruction to go ahead.",
      "The foreign ministers gathered in the Saudi city of Jeddah for a special session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to address the situation in Gaza, at a time when the 7-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been thrown into doubt.",
      "In a statement put out Saturday, the gathering threw its support behind a plan to rebuild Gaza put forward by Egypt and backed by Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, aimed at countering Trump\u2019s call. The OIC groups 57 nations with largely Muslim populations.",
      "Without specifically mentioning Trump, the ministers said they rejected \u201cplans aimed at displacing the Palestinian people individually or collectively \u2026 as ethnic cleansing, a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity.\u201d They also condemned \u201cpolicies of starvation\u201d that they said aim to push Palestinians to leave.",
      "The OIC also reinstated Syria as a member of the grouping.",
      "Syria was removed from the OIC in 2012 over then-President Bashar Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on opposition protests. After some 14 years of civil war, Assad was ousted in December by Islamist-led insurgents who since have created a transitional government.",
      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel\u2019s campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire\u2019s first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by militants in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "But an intended second phase of the deal \u2014 meant to bring the release of remaining hostages and a lasting truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2014 has been thrown into doubt. Israel has balked at entering negotiations over the terms of the second phase. Instead, it has called for Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in return for an extension of the ceasefire and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Since Sunday, Israel has barred all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza for some 2 million people, demanding Hamas accept the revised deal.",
      "At the same time, Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be resettled elsewhere permanently so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have rejected calls to leave.",
      "The ministers at the OIC gathering supported an Egyptian-backed proposal that an administrative committee replace Hamas in governing Gaza. The committee would work \u201cunder the umbrella\u201d of the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in the Gaza Strip, but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule in the territory.",
      "Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces have pulled back to a zone along Gaza\u2019s edges. Early Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinians in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck several men who appeared to have been flying a drone that entered Israel from Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others."

      "Pope Francis continued his recovery from double pneumonia Sunday after doctors reported some positive news: After more than three weeks in the hospital, the 88-year-old pope is responding well to treatment and has shown a \u201cgradual, slight improvement\u201d in recent days.",
      "In the early Sunday update, the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night. For the fourth Sunday in a row, the pope will not appear for his weekly noon blessing, though the Vatican planned to distribute the text he would have delivered if he were well enough.",
      "The Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained stable, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday.",
      "The doctors said that such stability \u201cas a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\u201d It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14.",
      "But they kept his prognosis as \u201cguarded\u201d, meaning he's not out of danger.",
      "In his absence, the Vatican\u2019s day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrates the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",

      "President Donald Trump abruptly stopped most foreign aid and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has significantly hampered the global humanitarian sector. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order froze the funding for a 90-day review.",
      "The World Food Program, the main U.N. food agency, recently announced that cuts to food rations will take effect from April 1 in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, where dozens of camps are inhabited by Rohingya refugees.",
      "More than 700,000 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar starting in late August 2017 when Myanmar's military launched a \u201cclearance operation.\u201d The ethnic group faces discrimination and are denied citizenship and other rights in the Buddhist-majority nation. Following a miliary takeover in 2021, the country has been engulfed in an armed conflict widely seen as civil war.",

      "\u201cAs the food is cut, they will get less nutritious food, which may lead to a lack of nutrition. There will be social and mental pressure created amongst the Rohingya people in their community. They will have to look for an alternative for the food,\u201d he said.",
      "Douza said there are more sectors where budgets have been cut beyond the food rations, but he would not say whether WFP cuts were related to the U.S. funding rollback.",
      "\u201cGenerally, there will be less (support) for the (Rohingya) response after the funding cuts. The response already has been slowed, and some people, including Rohingya, have lost their jobs, and some services are reduced. It does not bring a good result when the available services get reduced,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. has been the top donor to Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees, providing the U.N. with emergency food and nutrition assistance. The U.S. usually provides almost half of the aid money spent on the humanitarian response to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which provided about $300 million in 2024.",
      "As the news of the impending food reductions spread through the camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, fear and frustration gripped the refugees.",

      "BEIJING -- Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.",
      "The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared to a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.",
      "While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.",
      "The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared to 2024's elevated level.",
      "Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.",
      "That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.",
      "A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic headwinds.",
      "Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs."

      "Their nightmare was supposed to be over.",
      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\u201cIf we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\u201d he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "\u201cYour passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\u201d a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\u201d said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",
      "An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they\u2019re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\u201cThe ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\u201d Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\u201cYou can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\u201d she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \u201cI think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\u201d",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt really does require a kind of a global response.\u201d",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\u201d said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\u201d said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\u201d conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\u201d said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \u201cHowever, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\u201cThe resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\u201d said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\u201cThere is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\u201d",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",
      "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t affect anything,\u201d said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are \u201crich as hell\u201d and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\u201cMy friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \u201cIs anyone coming for us?\u201d",

      "KILGORIS, Kenya -- KILGORIS, Kenya (AP) \u2014 \u201cI am worth defending!\u201d a group of girls chant as they each take up a fighting stance.",
      "They are about to practice combat techniques. And no, they are not part of a martial arts club. They are Maasai girls living at a boarding school in Transmara in western Kenya, which doubles up as a rescue center for teens who have escaped early marriage and female genital mutilation.",
      "\u201cWe learn how to protect ourselves, how to protect our bodies,\u201d said Grace Musheni, 14, who has been living and studying at the Enkakenya Centre for Excellence since 2023.",
      "The center was set up in 2009 by Kakenya Ntaiya, a Maasai woman who was subjected to genital cutting herself. It doesn\u2019t just offer a safe haven for girls at risk of early marriage: it also provides a free high school education as an incentive for parents to allow their daughters to stay in school instead of undergoing the cutting ritual that is still common for Maasai girls between the ages of 8 and 17.",
      "Once a girl is circumcised, she is considered an adult and ripe for marriage, meaning an abrupt end to childhood and education for many.",
      "\u201cMost child marriages are caused by poverty in families,\u201d Musheni explains. \u201cBecause of this poverty, you can get that a parent can allow their daughter to be married by an old man \u2014 because the family can be paid.\u201d",
      "While Ntaiya was unable to escape genital mutilation herself, she convinced her father to allow her to continue her education, and she now holds a Ph.D. in education from the University of Pittsburgh and multiple awards for her work.",
      "\u201cI am a beneficiary of proper education and I really wanted to show my community how important it is to empower women and girls,\u201d she says.",
      "Although Kenyan law prohibits genital mutilation and marriage below age 18, both are still practiced, especially in rural areas where education levels remain low. The 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey by the government found that 56.3% of women with no education had undergone genital mutilation, compared to 5.9% of women who had studied past secondary school.",
      "Girls\u2019 education apparently has an impact on gender-based violence too, with 34% of Kenyan women surveyed saying they were victims of physical violence, a figure that drops to 23% for women with education.",
      "But that is still alarmingly high. So on top of providing education, the Enkakenya Centre partners with I\u2019m Worth Defending to teach combative self-defense skills. It\u2019s not so much so that they can physically fight potential abusers \u2014- although they could \u2014 but it teaches them to be assertive in all areas of their lives.",
      "\u201cWe train them with basic principles of assertiveness and boundary setting, which includes verbal and physical techniques,\u201d says Amelia Awuor from I\u2019m Worth Defending. \u201cThese skills instill confidence to speak up against violations or fight off physical threats.\u201d",
      "The training gave 14-year-old Rahab Lepishoi power to speak up for other girls. During a recent visit to her older sister, she learned that the girls in the village were about to be circumcised, including an old childhood friend. \u201cI told her about the dangers of FGM and to come with me to my home to avoid (it),\u201d Lepishoi says.",
      "She is following in the footsteps of her educators, who visit remote communities in Transmara every year to raise awareness about genital mutilation, early marriage and the importance of education. \u201cNow when I go to a place, I apply that skill of assertiveness and confidence. I educate my friends, so that when they meet with a boy, they will be confident and say what they mean,\u201d says Lepishoi.",
      "The self-defense classes also offer some protection against sexual abuse, which can end up trapping many in violent marriages. \u201cWhen a girl reports to her parents that she has been abused, it is common for the parents to force the girl to marry the man that abused her,\u201d said Musheni.",
      "Purity Risanoi, 15, has been at the school for five years. Her mother is a widow and raised her five children alone, but cultural pressures from her community remain. \u201cMy family is still very traditional,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a girl grows up, she is expected to get married and she cannot choose who to marry.\u201d",
      "Her solution? Keep studying. One day, she wants to be a lawyer.",
      "Musheni meanwhile dreams of a career as a software engineer. She wants to come back here and use technology to uplift her community. \u201cGirls can achieve great things,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to inspire others to chase their dreams.\u201d",

      "University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people.",
      "Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. Street demonstrations have become a challenge to the populist President Aleksandar Vucic.",

      "Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.",

      "The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power.",
      "The government has said that they were responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed \u201cindividual actions\u201d for the rampant violence.",
      "The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad\u2019s support base for decades.",
      "Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria\u2019s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts.",
      "They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety.",
      "Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them.

      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes.",
      "Sheha called the attacks \u201crevenge killings\u201d of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad's government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters, and militants from neighboring villages and towns.",
      "\u201cIt was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,\u201d as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes.",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said that 428 Alawites have been killed in revenge attacks in addition to 120 pro-Assad fighters and 89 from security forces. The Observatory\u2019s chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday.",
      "\u201cThis was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\u201d Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians.",

      "Syria\u2019s state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region \u201cto prevent violations and gradually restore stability.\u201d",
      "On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said.

      "Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad\u2019s fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed.",

      "Panama has released dozens of migrants deported from the United States who were held for weeks in a remote camp on the condition that they would leave the Central American nation in 30 days",
      "PANAMA CITY -- After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\u201cWe are refugees. We do not have money. We can not pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\u201d Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\"",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don\u2019t know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \u201cto send a signal of deterrence\u201d to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\u201cOnce I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \u201cblack holes\u201d for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\u201cMy hope was freedom. Just freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities.",
      "In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn\u2019t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \u201cwe do not accept asylum.\u201d",
      "\u201cNone of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\u201d said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama\u2019s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",
      "That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities.",
      "Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she'd find a way back to the U.S.",
      "\"I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,\" she said.",

      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said Friday the election will take place either in December or January 2026 at the latest, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. He announced the dates in a press conference while on an official visit to Belarus, one of the few allies of Myanmar\u2019s military government, saying that 53 political parties have already submitted their lists to participate in the election.",
      "However, Min Aung did not mention exact election dates.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis entered his fourth week in the hospital with double pneumonia, increasingly handing off his day-to-day duties to cardinals as questions swirl about the near and long-term future of his papacy.",
      "On Saturday, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, took Francis' place to celebrate Mass for a pro-life group. On Sunday, another Vatican official, Cardinal Michael Czerny, is stepping in for the pope to celebrate a Holy Year Mass for volunteers.",
      "There is no reason why such delegation of papal obligations cannot continue, especially since Francis remains conscious and working from the hospital. But the 88-year-old pope has spoken about the possibility of resignation, though his position has changed over time, especially after the death of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "Here's what Francis has said about pope's retiring, in his own words:",
      "In his 2024 memoir, Life, Francis recounted how he first learned about Benedict\u2019s resignation, the first in 600 years. He said a Vatican journalist had called him in Buenos Aires on Feb. 11, 2013, and told him the news as it was breaking.",
      "\u201cFor a moment I was paralyzed. I could hardly believe what I was hearing,\u201d Francis wrote in Life. \u201cThis was news I had never expected to receive in my lifetime: the resignation of a pope was unimaginable, although it was provided for in canon law. In the first few moments I said to myself, \u2018I must have misunderstood, it\u2019s not possible.\u2019 But then I understood that Benedict had surely meditated and prayed for a long time before making this brave and historic decision. Faced with his declining strength, he had evidently realized that the only irreplaceable element in the Church is the Holy Spirit, and the only Lord is Jesus Christ. This is why he was a great pope, humble and sincere, who loved the church until the end.\u201d",
      "During the 10 years they lived together in the Vatican as a reigning and retired pope, Francis repeatedly praised Benedict\u2019s courage and humility for resigning and said he had \u201copened the door\u201d to future popes also stepping down.",
      "In a 2022 interview with Spain's ABC daily, Francis revealed that he had written a letter of resignation soon after he was elected pontiff. The letter laid out his resignation if medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties or from freely announcing a resignation.",
      "The text of the letter has not been released and it\u2019s not known what sort of medical impairment or lack of consciousness might trigger a resignation. Canon law has no provision for what to do if a pope is permanently impaired and canonists are divided on whether a pre-written letter of resignation would be valid.",
      "Canon 332.2 says that for a pope to resign his office, \u201cit is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.\u201d",
      "Francis has repeated the existence of his resignation letter as recently as last year. But in Life, which was published a year ago this month, Francis said he had no plans to resign and was at least at that time enjoying good health.",
      "\u201cBut this is, I repeat, a distant possibility, because I truly do not have any cause serious enough to make me think of resigning,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people may have hoped that sooner or later, perhaps after a stay in the hospital, I might make an announcement of that kind, but there is no risk of it: Thanks be to God, I enjoy good health, and as I have said, there are many projects to bring to fruition, God willing.\u201d",
      "Benedict died Dec. 31, 2022, at age of 95. There were not a few problems during those 10 years of cohabitation, with traditionalists and conservatives looking to Benedict as their nostalgic point of reference.",
      "In his first interview with The Associated Press after the death, Francis again repeated that Benedict had opened up the possibility of future retired popes. He repeated that if he were to follow, he would live outside the Vatican in a home for retired priests in the diocese of Rome and be referred to as the \u201cemeritus bishop of Rome\u201d as opposed to \u201cemeritus pope.\u201d",
      "Francis said Benedict\u2019s decision to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican Gardens was a \u201cgood intermediate solution,\u201d but that future retired popes might want to do things differently.",
      "But a few weeks later, speaking to Congolese and South Sudanese priests, Francis changed tune. Freed from Benedict's presence, Francis pointed out the risks that papal resignations become the norm. He repeated that he had written a letter of resignation, but made clear the papacy was for life.",
      "\u201cI did it in case I have some health problem that prevents me from exercising my ministry and I am not fully conscious in order to resign,\u201d he said, according to the closed-door comments reported by the Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica.",
      "\u201cHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that resigning popes should become, let\u2019s say, a \u2018fashion,\u2019 or a normal thing. Benedict had the courage to do it because he didn\u2019t feel like going on because of his health. I for the moment do not have that on my agenda. I believe that the pope\u2019s ministry is ad vitam (for life). I see no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be so. The ministry of the great patriarchs is always for life. And historical tradition is important.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf, on the other hand, we listen to the gossip well, then we should change popes every six months!\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian special forces walked kilometers (miles) inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine\u2019s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow moves to recapture parts of its border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive.",
      "Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk i n August, in what marked the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks, and force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine.",
      "But months after Ukraine\u2019s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russia's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open source maps of the battlefield show.",
      "According to Telegram posts by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed.",
      "The town had some 5,000 residents before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory.",
      "Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff confirmed on Saturday evening that Russian \u201csabotage and assault groups\u201d used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said the Russian troops were \u201cdetected in a timely manner\u201d and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery.",
      "\u201cAt present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy\u2019s losses in Sudzha are very high,\u201d the General Staff reported.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going.",
      "But the same factors that have pulled mortgage rates to their lowest level since December \u2014 signs that the U.S. economy is slowing and uncertainty over the potential fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports \u2014 are clouding the outlook for where mortgage rates will go from here.",
      "\u201cWe do not anticipate significant relief from high mortgage rates in the near future because of inflation remaining stubbornly high, which will not be helped by the tariffs that the Trump administration appears committed to rolling out,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has declined six weeks in a row from 7.04% in mid-January to 6.76% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year earlier, it averaged 6.94%.",
      "The average rate is now at its lowest level since Dec. 19, when it was 6.72%. It briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but remains more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates echoes moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 4.79% in mid-January, has been mostly easing since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the potential impact from the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners.",
      "While one could say the bond market jitters have ultimately benefited home shoppers by leading to lower mortgage rates, the trajectory for rates from here is far from certain.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "And then there\u2019s the Fed, which has signaled a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue.",
      "So far, the steady decline in mortgage rates this year hasn\u2019t been enough to drive home sales higher. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in January as rising mortgage rates and prices froze out many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "Pending home sales, a bellwether for future completed sales, point to potentially further sales declines in coming months. They slid to an all-time low in January.",
      "Still, last week, mortgage applications jumped 20.4% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 37%, the MBA said.",
      "While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase is a signal that mortgage rates have fallen enough to spur some buyers off the fence.",
      "The pullback in rates comes at a good time for home shoppers. The inventory of homes on the market has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida.",
      "Still, more attractive mortgage rates may not be enough to motivate home shoppers if the economy and labor market worsen.",
      "\u201cInflation is still a problem, but now the economy is starting to show signs of weakness,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cWhat that means to the housing market is that those two factors make buyers more reluctant to jump into the market.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 is baffling businesses and causing them to delay or cancel the investments that help drive economic growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers\u2019 back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can\u2019t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he\u2019s bringing to the United States from China.",
      "There\u2019s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced that he was suspending many of the levies on Mexico and some of them on Canada for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4.",
      "\u201cTrump is jerking around the entire continent of North America right now, it\u2019s stupid and it has to stop,\" Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said. \"Today there are businesses that don\u2019t even know if the goods they trade in are subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Everything Trump does on trade seems designed to maximize chaos and uncertainty.",
      "Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China \u2013 which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he\u2019s not sure where the tariff will actually land.",
      "\u201cThe misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "\u201cIt creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. \u201cThe uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.''",
      "During Trump\u2019s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.",
      "Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets \u2014 steel and aluminum and most goods from China \u2014 after lengthy investigations.",
      "This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders \u2014 to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he\u2019s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u2019\u2019 on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.",
      "\u201cJust the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on \u2014 on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,\u2019\u2019 European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe\u2019s struggling economy.",
      "His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. \u201cPast trade agreements simply don\u2019t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,\u201d said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty: It\u2019s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury \u2014 money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America\u2019s big trade deficits with most other countries.",
      "Since the goals are cloudy, it\u2019s hard to see what it will take to make Trump\u2019s tariffs go away.",
      "Not only that, but he\u2019s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole \u2013 the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "Businesses are baffled. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,\u2019\u201d said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump\u2019s first term \u201cthey knew what the ground rules were. Now they don\u2019t know if we\u2019re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.\u2019\u2019",
      "Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. \u201cThere is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it\u2019s harder to project how they will affect business,\u201d a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: \u201cThe tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cRight now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,\u201d said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.",
      "Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant.",
      "\u201cThat construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans.",
      "\u201cDevelopers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don\u2019t account for new tariffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThose budgets will be blown.\u2019\u2019",
      "Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, we won\u2019t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.\u201d",
      "Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs.

      "NEW YORK -- Macy's swung to a profit in the fourth quarter, though sales dipped with shoppers remaining cautious about spending.",
      "The strength of the quarterly profit surprised Wall Street, but sales were just below expectations and uncertainty about both the American consumer and new tariffs seeped into the company's outlook for 2025.",

      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners resulted in immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, while roiling financial markets. Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.",
      "The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.",
      "Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.",
      "Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.",
      "\u201cWe are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,\u201d Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. \"And we have to lean into that. And so, I don\u2019t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I\u2019m not an economist, I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?\"",
      "The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.",
      "Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.",
      "Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.",
      "Comparable sales at the overall company\u2014 established business from physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.",
      "Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives \u2014 which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays\u2014 have been added to another 75 stores.",
      "Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale\u2019s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.",
      "Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders are trumpeting their endorsement of a plan to free up hundreds of billions of euros to inject into their defense budgets after the Trump administration warned that the continent must look after its own security, including Ukraine, in future.",
      "After more than 12 hours of talks on Thursday, the 27 leaders signed off on a scheme that would ease budget restrictions for defense spending, funnel some of the EU\u2019s unused funds toward security priorities and provide 150 billion euros ($162 billion) in loans for military purchases.",
      "As a priority, the funds would be spent on air and missile defense, artillery systems, ammunition, drones and air transport, as well as cyber systems, artificial intelligence and electronic warfare.",
      "The three-year war in Ukraine was also top of the agenda, but no obvious short-term solutions were found to keep the country in the fight, after the U.S. halted military support and intelligence sharing. No new weapons were pledged, no ready cash identified.",
      "Hungary also vetoed a joint statement on support to Ukraine, notably the stance of the 26 other member countries that their war-ravaged partner can only achieve \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d",
      "All 27 leaders agreed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, should loosen budget restrictions so countries that are willing can increase their military spending. The commission monitors whether members are keeping their debt under control.",
      "It estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way, and could allow each country to spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product on defense. NATO\u2019s current guideline is that allies should spend at least 2%.",
      "Seven EU countries fall short of that figure, including heavyweights Italy and Spain.",
      "It remains to be seen whether countries that pledged to hit 2% more than a decade ago and still haven\u2019t are now willing, or even able, to dig deeper into their pockets.",
      "The commission also tabled a proposal for an offer of loans worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment, with material priorities to be based on lessons learned from the battlefield in Ukraine. Air and missile defenses are right up there.",
      "The European Commission said it would raise the money on financial markets, and that around 20 member countries would benefit from the more favorable rates that it could generate.",
      "But the leaders did not welcome the idea with open arms. Instead, they invited EU headquarters staff \u201cto examine this proposal as a matter of urgency.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are very thankful that we are not alone, and these are not just words. We feel it. It\u2019s very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said, looking more relaxed among Europe\u2019s leaders in Brussels than when he received a verbal lashing from Trump in Washington last week.",
      "But the EU offered no new weapons, a day after Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown was bombed again, even though the leaders might argue that this was not the main goal of their summit.",
      "No discussion was held on whether to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized if Europe was willing.",

      "\u201cThey will have to stop that work immediately. That will cost local jobs, hobble the creation of affordable homes, and stall opportunity in hundreds of communities.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HUD said the program, called Section 4, will continue and is not being cut, but that \u201cthe department is consolidating some grants, while others remain.\"",
      "It remains unclear how or when the funding will arrive to the small nonprofits, which has thrown their work into disarray.",
      "\u201cNot knowing for me means we assume that the money is not coming, and that means that I have to pivot,\" said Jonathan Green, executive director of a nonprofit in Mississippi that's building a 36-unit affordable housing development in Biloxi.",
      "Green said about $20,000 in grant dollars are now in limbo, money that was meant to pay for an environmental review that could cost upwards of $10,000, and licenses and permits. That threatens discussions Green is having with potential partners and investors who want to see all the up-front work done first.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that, if the project stops altogether, we may never get it started again,\u201d he said.",
      "The development is supposed to be in East Biloxi, where lots still remain empty after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Before an ounce of dirt has been moved on the project, Green's organization has received enough calls from people eager to become tenants that they\u2019ve started a waiting list.",
      "That's the position hundreds of other small nonprofits have found themselves in, with not just their grant funds in question but investments on the line. For every dollar in grants disbursed by Enterprise Community Partners, the local nonprofits leverage another $95 in other capital, CEO Donovan said.",
      "Congress gave the national nonprofits the job of administering the grants, fielding and assessing hundreds of applications, so that the government doesn\u2019t have to, Donovan said.",
      "In one of the contract termination letters obtained by the AP, HUD said the contracts were cancelled at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency. It said the group's operations \u201cwere not in compliance\" with Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The letter also allows the organizations to appeal the termination.",
      "The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is the other group whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cWithout access to this seed capital, housing projects for hardworking, families will stall, worsening shortages and pushing distressed neighbors into overcrowded conditions or homelessness,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Habitat for Humanity International is the third nonprofit disbursing the grants, but the organization has not responded to repeated requests for comment or said if their contract was cancelled.",

      "The rate decision Thursday, which was widely expected by economists, was overshadowed by concerns over a potential trade war with the U.S. and the impact of a surge in defense spending, two factors that could upend expectations for growth and inflation.",
      "The ECB\u2019s rate-setting council lowered its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5%. That should provide support for growth by making it cheaper to borrow and buy a house or expand a factory. The rate was raised to a record 4% to combat inflation that reached 10.6% in Oct. 2022, but has been reducing it steadily since June.",
      "As inflation has fallen to an annual, 2.4% concern has shifted to weak growth prospects in the 20 countries that use the euro currency. The eurozone showed zero growth in the last three months of 2024, and prospects for this year are muted amid uncertainty about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy.",
      "President Christine Lagarde said at her post-meeting news conference that with the cut, rates were \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d on economic activity, but added that the bank was \u201cnot pre-committing to a particular rate path\" in months ahead.",
      "She acknowledged conflicting pressures ahead from trade and the prospect of more government spending. While \u201can increase in defense and infrastructure spending could also add to growth... increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation.\u201d",
      "At its last meeting, the bank said rates were still in \u201crestrictive\u201d territory, indicating further cuts were ahead. After Thursday, the bank's next step is less clear, said Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank.",
      "\u201cWith the increased uncertainty and the prospects of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB\u2019s direction of travel after today\u2019s rate cut is no longer as clear as it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cA pause at the next meeting to come to terms with the new macro reality now looks like a possibility.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile new concerns that would massively reshuffle the economic picture are likely to intrude: the potential impact of new tariffs on European imports from U.S. President Trump, which could slow growth, and plans for massive new defense spending and borrowing, which could mean more growth but also more inflation.",
      "Those two forces could push the ECB in opposite directions: a hit to growth would call for lower rates in months ahead, while more persistent inflation would argue for keeping rates higher in coming months.",
      "Growth estimates for Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, shot up overnight and long-term interest rates rose in response to an agreement by the two parties that will form the country\u2019s next government to loosen constitutional limits on borrowing and exempt defense spending.",
      "That is a major turnaround in German budget policy and opens the way for a trillion or more in new borrowing and spending over the next decade.",
      "Also in the mix are concerns that Trump will impose new tariffs on European goods, hurting growth in an export-dependent economy.",
      "The 20 countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB determines interest rate policy stagnated in the last three months of the year, showing zero growth. Consumers burned by an earlier outbreak of inflation remain cautious, while businesses have been unsettled by concerns about what Trump may do.",
      "Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, predicted the ECB would stay flexible and decide based on incoming data: \u201cThe possible push, in terms of GDP growth, from higher government spending may be offset by the pull coming from US tariffs and the net effect is unclear.\u201d"

    "summary": "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an &ldquo;unprovoked attack.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an \u201cunprovoked attack.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration, marking a major effort to dismantle union protections under the Trump administration. The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees is the union representing the TSA workers. The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "The union said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "France decisively took over the lead of the championship with a bonus-point victory and can clinch its first title since 2022 in the final round at home next Saturday when it hosts Scotland.",
      "Meanwhile, Ireland's Grand Slam hopes were destroyed in the fourth round for a second straight year, and its hopes of a third successive outright title, unprecedented in the tournament's 142-year history, were probably sunk.",
      "England was also in the title picture, barring an upset at home against Italy on Sunday, but France's other big advantage was an extremely healthy points differential of +106, which is 93 points better than Ireland.",
      "The breadth of France's win by five tries to three, running up its highest score in Ireland, was even more impressive in the absence for the last 50 minutes of talismanic captain Antoine Dupont. He limped off with help because of a right knee injury. When he left, France was leading 5-0 but the momentum was swung.",
      "France was on the ropes for the first 15 minutes, absorbing waves of Irish attacks. But when lock Joe McCarthy was sin-binned for a cynical foul, Dupont set up wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey for the first of his two tries against the run of play.",
      "Ireland, trailing by two at halftime, led 13-8 soon after, but for only four minutes.",
      "Flanker Paul Boudehent crashed over after offloads by prop Jean-Baptiste Gros and Maxime Lucu, Dupont's replacement.",
      "In a double blow to Ireland, winger Calvin Nash was yellow-carded for a high tackle and France pulled away from there thanks to unleashing the seven reserves forwards off the bench.",
      "Ireland couldn't withstand the injection of fresh power.",
      "A France counter-ruck in its own half led to Damian Penaud freeing his fellow wing Bielle-Biarrey, who grubbered ahead and beat Lucu to ground the ball. The try was Bielle-Biarrey's tournament-leading seventh, and 17th in 18 tests.",
      "Replacement lock Oscar Jegou scored his first test try and, while Gros was in the sin-bin, Thomas Ramos intercepted Ireland's Sam Prendergast 10 meters out from his own try-line and let Penaud finish between the posts for his 38th test try, tying the France record of Serge Blanco.",
      "Ramos, as ever, was unerring by nailing his last seven goalkicks.",
      "With victory long secure at 42-13, France took its foot off the pedal, and Ireland scored the last two tries, one of them to caps record-holder Cian Healy, who was playing his last test at home along with Conor Murray and Peter O'Mahony.",
      "Ireland was dealt a major blow moments before kickoff when wing James Lowe suffered a back spasm in the warmup and had to withdraw.",
      "But the way Ireland started suggested France was in for a long afternoon. The Irish camped in the French 22 but breached an equally fierce defense only once, and captain Caelan Doris was held up over the line by opposite Gregory Alldritt.",
      "After McCarthy's yellow card, his heft was missed when France mauled a lineout infield, shortened the defense and Bielle-Biarrey scored in a seventh straight test, eclipsing Penaud's France record.",
      "Dupont then exited, exposing France's risk of a 7-1 bench with only one back reserve. But the gamble paid off handsomely. Lucu was outstanding and the \u201cbomb squad,\u201d notably Emmanuel Meafou and Julien Marchand, overpowered a tiring Ireland in the third quarter.",

      "Launched last week, the lander named Athena, missed its mark by more than 800 feet (250 meters) and ended up in a frigid crater, the company said.",
      "It managed to send back pictures confirming its position and activate a few experiments before going silent. NASA and other customers had packed the lander with an ice drill, drone and pair of rovers.",
      "It's unlikely Athena's batteries can be recharged given the way the lander's solar panels are pointed and the extreme cold in the crater.",
      "\u201cThe mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "This was the second landing attempt for Intuitive Machines. The first, a year ago, also ended with a sideways landing, but the company was able to keep it going for longer than this time despite hampered communications and operations.",
      "Earlier in the week, another Texas company scored a successful landing under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program. Firefly Aerospace put its Blue Ghost lander down in the far northern latitudes of the moon\u2019s near side.",

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "A group of lobster fishermen can sue one of the world\u2019s largest seafood watchdog groups for defamation, a federal court has ruled, over a report that described Maine lobster as an unwise choice for consumers.",
      "The threat to a rare whale species from getting tangled in fishing gear has prompted Monterey Bay Aquarium in California to caution against eating a variety of lobster that New England fishermen have harvested for centuries.",
      "Seafood Watch, a conservation program operated by the aquarium, placed lobster from the U.S. and Canada on its do-not-eat \u201cred list\u201d in 2022. Some retailers pulled lobster from stores after the recommendation.",
      "Judge John Woodcock ruled last month that the fishermen made a case that they suffered damage to their industry's reputation as a result of the red-listing, after the aquarium made a bid in U.S. District Court in Maine to have the 2023 lawsuit tossed. A spokesperson for the aquarium said Monday the institution filed an appeal, but Woodcock's ruling means the lawsuit is moving forward.",
      "\u201cReputation and goodwill cannot be adequately replaced through awarding damages and this injury lingers as long as the \u2018red listing\u2019 does,\u201d Woodcock wrote.",
      "The lobster industry, based largely in Maine, is one of the most lucrative fisheries in the U.S., valued at more than half a billion dollars at the docks last year. Entanglement in lobster gear is also one of the most significant threats to the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers less than 400.",
      "The aquarium has a right to communicate its recommendations to the public, said Emerson Brown, the spokesperson for the aquarium. Brown said the aquarium appealed \"to protect our ability to share critical information with the public.\u201d",
      "The Maine Lobstermen's Association, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit, described Woodcock's decision as \u201csignificant\u201d in a statement.",
      "\u201cMaine lobstermen have been stewards of the ocean for generations, and we are committed to defending our livelihood against baseless claims,\" said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the association.",

      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically a part of the AI enterprise,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand ourselves and, of course, to make things that can work even better. Maybe to become such things.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",

      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts are just a few weeks away from finally returning to Earth after nine months in space.",
      "Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have to wait until their replacements arrive at the International Space Station next week before they can check out later this month.",
      "They\u2019ll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats.",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams' return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The U.K.'s data protection watchdog said Monday that it's investigating how TikTok uses the personal information of teenagers to deliver content recommendations to them when they use the social media platform.",
      "The Information Commissioner's Office said that there are growing concerns around how social media platforms were using data generated by children\u2019s online activity to power their recommendation algorithms, and the potential for young people to see inappropriate or harmful content as a result.",
      "The regulator said that it wanted to ensure the robustness of TikTok's safety procedures when it comes to using the personal information of teens ranging in age from 13 to 17.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what they\u2019re collecting, it\u2019s how they work,\u201d information commissioner John Edwards said. \u201cI will expect to find that there will be many benign and positive uses of children\u2019s data in their recommender systems.\"",
      "\u201cWhat I am concerned about is whether they are sufficiently robust to prevent children being exposed to harm, either from addictive practices on the device or the platform, or from content that they see, or from other unhealthy practices,\u201d he said.",
      "As part of the investigation, the regulator will also look into how online forum site Reddit and image-sharing site Imgur use children's personal data and how they estimate or verify a child's age.",
      "TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to ensuring a positive experience for young people on TikTok.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur recommender systems are designed and operate under strict and comprehensive measures that protect the privacy and safety of teens, including industry-leading safety features and robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens\u2019 feeds,\" it said.",
      "In 2023, the regulator imposed a fine of 12.7 million pounds (about $16 million) on the video sharing app for misusing children's data and violating other protections for young users' personal information.",
      "The office said at the time that TikTok didn\u2019t adequately identify and remove children under 13 from the platform, and that it allowed as many as 1.4 million children in the U.K. under 13 to use the app in 2020, despite the platform\u2019s own rules prohibiting children that young from setting up accounts.",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Molly Kelly was stunned to discover in June that someone she knew had used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d technology to create highly realistic and sexually explicit videos and images of her, using family photos that were posted on social media.",
      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",
      "\u201cThis cannot continue,\" she said. \"These tech companies cannot keep unleashing this technology into the world with no consequences. It is harmful by its very nature.\u201d",

      "The UAW -- which has around 1 million members -- has long backed a return of jobs and manufacturing by U.S. automakers. The organization has also praised Trump's decision to impose tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals,\" the union said in a statement posted to its website on Tuesday. \"We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.\"",

      "\"There's been a lot of talk of these tariffs 'disrupting' the economy,\" the UAW said in its statement last week. \"But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don't want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\"",

I'll tell you about a Ponzi scheme. The only Ponzi scheme we've seen in the last 40 years is the rich getting richer while the working class and everyone else gets left behind.\"",
      "On \"This Week,\" Fain said, \"The election is over. Donald Trump is the president, and we want to get to work to fix the problems that are wrong with this country, with our economy.

      "\"I think the lack of a coordinated response in the State of the Union was a mistake, and frankly, it took the focus off of where it should have been, which is on the fact that the president spoke for an hour and 40 minutes and had nothing to say about what he would do to bring down costs for American families that were watching that lengthy address sitting at the kitchen table, hoping that he would offer something to help them afford a new home or pay the rent to afford health care or child care,\" Schiff said on \u201cThis Week.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers participated in various protests during Trump\u2019s speech. Some female members of Congress wore hot pink to show resistance. Other Democratic members held signs that called out Elon Musk. Some decided to boycott the speech or leave early.",
      "Schiff refuted Democratic strategist James Carville's recent proposal in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should \u201croll over and play dead\u201d and wait for Republicans \"to crumble beneath their own weight,\" with the California senator instead saying that the right approach is focusing on \"the economic well-being of Americans.\"",
      "\"We need to have our own broad, bold agenda ... to answer really the central question which is, if you're working hard in America, can you still earn a good living?\" said Schiff. \"We need to be advancing policies and making the arguments about what we have to offer, not simply standing back and letting them collapse of our own corrupt weight. We need to effectively use litigation as we are. We need to effectively use communication to talk to new people in new ways as we are.\"",

      "The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to \"score political points.\"",
      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",
      "Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by what he said.",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

      "Over the coming week, federal judges have ordered key Trump administration officials to testify about mass firings and the dismantling of key agencies, while DOGE representatives will likely have to turn over evidence in dozens of cases and participate in a sworn deposition for at least one case.",
      "The legal challenges materializing against DOGE could present an existential challenge for the group, whose effectiveness has in part stemmed from its ability to move quickly and make massive changes without the normal oversight.",
      "While Musk and Trump have touted DOGE's transparency -- including on DOGE's website, where it lists recently canceled contracts -- the plaintiffs challenging the group have argued that the group has relied on secrecy to hide tactics that violate federal law.",
      "\"[T]he entity has worked in the shadows -- a cadre of largely unidentified actors, whose status as government employees is unclear, controlling major government functions with no oversight,\" one lawsuit alleged.",
      "That secrecy has also made it harder for nonprofits or federal unions to successfully block DOGE in court, with many plaintiffs relying on media reporting -- rather than documentary evidence -- to prove the harms DOGE has allegedly caused.",
      "\"The court can't act based on the media reports. We can't do that,\" one federal judge said in a case about the constitutionality of Musk's power. \"The things that I'm hearing are concerning indeed and troubling indeed, but I have to have a record, and I have to make a finding the facts before I issue something.\"",
      "But that might begin to change as the cases against DOGE progress and plaintiffs are entitled to receive discovery -- i.e., the exchange of evidence -- relevant to key allegations. At least one federal judge has ordered a DOGE representative to sit for a sworn deposition about the group's access to the federal government's sensitive data.",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C, was scheduled Friday afternoon to consider what kind of regulations will govern the transparency behind DOGE after the group argued it shouldn't be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and next week might provide some of the first sworn testimony about Trump's effort to rapidly reduce the size of government since retaking office.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Washington is holding a hearing at which the acting chief operating officer of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been ordered to testify about the ongoing dismantling of the agency, and a separate judge in California on Thursday is requiring the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management to testify under oath about how the Trump administration allegedly ordered the mass firing of probationary employees.",
      "\"We will prove in this case that remarkably, and I do not say this lightly, your honor, Acting Director [Charles] Ezell is not telling the truth to this court,\" a lawyer challenging the mass firings alleged, prompting the judge overseeing the case to order Ezell to testify in person.",
      "\"We're going to have Ezell come out here and he's going to be under oath right up there and these lawyers are going to quiz him,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said.",
      "During a court hearing on Thursday about Ezell's testimony, lawyers with the Department of Justice said the administration is considering making Ezell unavailable for testimony despite the court's order, citing logistical concerns and their potential appeal of the decision. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the move a clear defiance of a court order and a delay tactic.",
      "\"No final decision had been made,\" a DOJ lawyer told Judge Alsup, suggesting the final decision would be made in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has already begun its appeal in more than a dozen cases challenging Trump's executive actions, and two adverse rulings have already reached the Supreme Court.",

DOGE's inquiries about the telephone service have raised concerns that it may be planning either to replace the telephone service with private call centers or eliminate it as an option for filing claims, sources said.",
      "\"Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them. The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement provided to ABC News on Friday.",

      "Dudek said they were being given access to people's names, birth dates and earnings information but not disability information. He also noted that the staffers were granted expedited background checks by the FBI and had been onboarded as agency employees.",

      "In a Feb. 25 letter Dudek sent Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the acting SSA commissioner said the six people given access to the Social Security Administration's master system, called the Enterprise Data Warehouse, were undergoing background checks.",
      "He said one of them was a \"special government employee\" while the other were \"detailees\" from other federal agencies now assigned to his agency. Dudek did not name the employees granted access, citing safety concerns.",
      "DOGE was created by Trump shortly after taking office as a way to cut government waste, and he put Musk in charge of delegating staff to the agencies.",
      "Musk has put some of his top DOGE lieutenants at the agency, according to sources, including Ethan Shaotran, 22, who is internally listed as a \"chief information officer\" at the SSA and is a software engineer who specializes in artificial intelligence. He founded Spark, an AI scheduling assistant startup that received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI in 2024.",
      "Other DOGE representatives listed as chief information officers at the SSA include Gautier \"Cole\" Killian, 24, and Nikhil Rajpal, 30, sources told ABC News.",
      "Marko Elez, is also listed as working at the SSA, sources said. Elez temporarily resigned from DOGE this year following reports of past racist social media posts but was reinstated by Musk after receiving support from Vice President J.D. Vance, among others. According to court documents, Elez was among those granted access to sensitive taxpayer information at the Treasury Department earlier this year.",

Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",
      "\"The premise\u2026is incompatible with agency priorities, and no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities,\" the letters continue.",
      "The letters state that typically NIH allows grant recipients to \"take appropriate corrective action\" before a termination decision is allowed. However, the letters declare \"No corrective action is possible here.\"",
      "It comes as President Donald Trump has made sweeping changes to the federal government in his first few weeks in office, including issuing new guidance that only recognizes two sexes, vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism\" and issuing several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",
      "Neither the NIH nor the White House immediately replied to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Additionally, NIH institutes and centers are being asked to review awards for new and ongoing projects to ensure they do not \"contain any DEI research activities or DEI language that give the perception that NIH funds can be used to support these activities.\"",
      "According to a guidance document, obtained by ABC News, NIH employees are being asked to place these projects in one of four categories. Category one is if the project's purpose is solely related to DEI, in which case the award cannot be issued.",
      "Category two involves projects \"partially\" supporting DEI activities. The award can only be granted if the \"non-compliant\" activities are negotiated out of the project.",
      "Category three involves projects that do not support DEI activities but may contain DEI-related language, which must be removed before an award can be issued, and category four involves projects that do not support any DEI activities.",
      "It's unclear what it exactly means for a project to support DEI activities or contain DEI language, but the guidance document includes examples such as the purpose of a meeting being diversity or \"a statement regarding institutional commitment to diversity.\"",

      "\"As made clear by the declarations in support of a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Rate Change Notice, the risk of harm to research institutions and beyond is immediate, devastating, and irreparable,\" U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley wrote about the attempt to cap indirect costs at 15%, adding the attempt to cut funding violated federal law.",
      "It remains to be seen if the injunction will have an effect on the projects from universities that received termination letters.",

    "story": [
      "Jerome Powell issued remarks as Trump threatened new tariffs on Canada.",
      "As President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new tariffs on Canadian products, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the  administration's tariff plan would likely raise prices for U.S. shoppers and retailers.",
      "The scale and duration of the tariffs remain unclear but a portion of the taxes on imports will probably reach consumers, Powell told an economic forum in New York City on Friday.",
      "\"We're at a stage where we're still very uncertain about what will be tariffed, for how long, at what level,\" Powell said. \"But the likelihood is some of that will find its way. It will hit the exporters, the importers, the retailers and to some extent consumers.\"",
      "The Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude are widely expected to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "\"Everybody is forecasting some inflation effect from tariffs,\" Powell said on Friday.",
      "The remarks from Powell at the annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum marked a notable prediction from the nation's top central banker charged with keeping inflation under control.",
      "While acknowledging the likelihood of price hikes, however, Powell said the Fed's response would depend on what exactly transpires.",
      "A potentially temporary bump in prices may not warrant intervention, while a more sustained increase could require action, Powell said, noting that the strength of the economy affords the Fed time to assess the impact.",
      "\"In some cases, where we think it's a one-time thing, the textbook would be to look through it,\" Powell said. \"If it turns into a series of things and it's more than that -- [and] if the increases are larger -- that would matter.\"",
      "Powell spoke hours after Trump on Truth Social threatened to slap tariffs, sanctions and other measures on Russia in response to conduct in the war with Ukraine.",
      "The tariffs may become necessary \"based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now,\" Trump said.",
      "Later on Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he may also impose new tariffs on Canada, including a tariff on lumber and a 250% duty on dairy products.",
      "Trump indicated the U.S. could take reciprocal action against Canada's roughly 250% tariff on dairy as soon as Friday.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250% nobody ever talks about that 250% tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said.",
      "The potential moves could expand Trump's confrontational trade policy beyond a set of tariffs put forward this week.",
      "The tariff policy could cause \"some disturbance\" for the U.S., Trump noted in his remarks at the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has eased some of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico in recent days.",
      "Trump issued a one-month delay for tariffs on auto-related goods from Mexico and Canada. The carve-out expanded soon afterward with an additional one-month pause for goods from Mexico and Canada compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.",
      "In addition to tariffs, Powell mentioned other economic proposals pursued by the Trump administration, including measures affecting fiscal policy and regulation.",
      "\"The new administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes,\" Powell said. \"Uncertainty around these changes and their likely effects remains high. We are focused on parsing the signal from the noise as the situation evolves. We are not in a hurry.\"",

      "Congress has one week to pass a spending bill that would avert a government shutdown, but lawmakers from both parties are not on the same page about how they'll move forward.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he aims to hold a vote on Tuesday in the House on a clean short-term bill that would fund the government at current levels through the end of September 2025, but the details of the proposal remain unclear.",
      "Leaders said they are hoping to release the legislative text as soon as Friday, but that will likely slide into the weekend.",
      "\"I believe we'll pass it along party lines,\" Johnson told reporters on Thursday. \"But I think every Democrat should vote for this [continuing resolution]. It is a fundamental responsibility we have to fund the government, and a clean CR with a few minor anomalies is not something they should vote against, so we'll see what they do.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has lobbied House Republicans to support the measure, including hard-liners who typically vote against continuing resolutions.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday.",

      "Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, have said they will vote no on a continuing resolution -- presenting a challenge for Johnson, who is navigating a tight House majority.",
      "Top House Democratic leaders explicitly said Friday in a letter to colleagues that they will oppose Johnson's funding bill, arguing it could lead to cuts down the road to programs such as Medicaid.",
      "\"Republicans have decided to introduce a partisan continuing resolution that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year. That is not acceptable,\" they wrote.",
      "\"We cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk,\" they added. \"Medicaid is our redline.\"",
      "Any funding bill will also need to clear the Senate, where Democratic support will be critical. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has already vowed to vote against the legislation, which means at least eight Democrats will be needed for any funding proposal to pass.",
      "Democrats have so far kept their cards close as to what they'll do if presented with such a bill. Many Senate Democrats say a six-month continuing resolution, like the one Johnson is proposing, would be a \"disaster,\" but they've also expressed little interest in shutting down the government.",
      "Some Democrats prefer a plan that would see the passage of a shorter stopgap measure to allow completion of work on full-year appropriations bills.",
      "But if Johnson passes his plan and the House flees Washington, there may be few alternative options remaining that don't trigger at least a brief government shutdown.",
      "Government funding is one of the few areas in which Democrats, who have been pushing for ways to challenge Elon Musk's cuts via the Department of Government Efficiency, can assert their leverage. Whether or not they'll ultimately use this bill to make that stand, and risk shutting the government down, remains to be seen."

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-crypto-czar-public-lost-17-billion/story?id=119568771",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:57:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Crypto czar David Sacks argued taxpayers have lost out on billions because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin in the government's possession.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is holding a digital assets summit on cryptocurrency on Friday.",
      "David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, said Friday that taxpayers have lost out on \"over $17 billion of value\" because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin already in the U.S. government's possession.",
      "\"Over the past decade or so, the federal government has come into the possession of roughly 400,000 bitcoin through civil or criminal asset forfeitures,\" Sacks said in an interview with ABC News\u2019 Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang on Friday. \"We've had this very ad hoc strategy where we just would sell the bitcoin, sort of almost willy-nilly, and we sold about half of it. We only made about $400 million. Today, that bitcoin would have been worth over $17 billion, so the American taxpayer lost out on over $17 billion of value.\"",
      "Sacks' comments follow President Donald Trump signing an executive order on Thursday that creates a strategic bitcoin reserve and U.S. digital assets stockpile. Senior White House officials said bitcoin is being treated differently from other cryptocurrencies because it is the \"original\" cryptocurrency and there is a finite amount.",
      "Sacks brushed off repeated questions about whether this could pose a conflict of interest since President Donald Trump has a personal financial stake in the success of the industry after launching his own cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial, days before the inauguration.",
      "\"It's not an issue,\" Sacks told Wang.",
      "When asked about Bloomberg News' reporting that World Liberty Financial appears to have bought more than $20 million in cryptocurrency two days before the White House's Digital Assets Summit on Friday, Sacks said: \"You should talk to them about that. That's a private company. I'm not a regulator. I'm a policy adviser for innovation. I don't keep tabs on what individual companies are doing.\"",
      "Sacks stressed that the government is not buying any cryptocurrency, just using the cryptocurrency that has already been accumulated through criminal or civil asset forfeitures.",
      "\"Any further accumulation of bitcoin by the government has to be done in a completely budget-neutral way. It cannot add to the deficit, it cannot add to the debt, it cannot tax the American people,\" Sacks said. \"So this is about maximizing the value of assets that we already have on our balance sheet.\"",
      "When asked by ABC News how the government could \"accumulate\" more bitcoin in a budget-neutral way, Sacks said those programs don't exist, noting the administration is still in the planning phase and that the executive order calls on the secretaries of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Treasury to \"think about that.\"",
      "\"It won't cost the taxpayer dimes, but if the secretaries can figure out how to accumulate more bitcoin without costing taxpayers anything, then they are authorized to do that,\" the senior White House officials added.",
      "Sacks repeatedly compared bitcoin to U.S. holdings of gold, explaining that the U.S. won't be selling it, unless Trump changes his mind down the road.",
      "\"We've got about a trillion dollars of gold in Fort Knox and our other depositories,\" he said. \"We don't sell that gold, even though we could use it to pay off a trillion dollars of national debt. The reason why we don't sell it, liquidate it all today is because we believe it's strategic for the United States to have a stockpile or reserve of that asset.",
      "\"In a similar way, we believe it's in the long term interest the United States to hold on to this bitcoin,\" he added. \"Look, if the president changes his mind at some point in the future, he could issue a new executive order and say, the secretary of the treasury, get rid of it, sell it. But we don't want to do that.\"",
      "White House officials also noted that an official audit of the government's digital asset holdings has never been completed but will be following the president's executive order, allowing the administration to get a more concrete understanding of what the U.S. possesses.",

    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
      "When her daughter was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in 2010, Amy Gleason attacked the challenge.",
      "She carried binders of medical records to doctors\u2019 appointments across six health systems seeking the best care for juvenile dermatomyositis. She volunteered at a nonprofit searching for a cure. She also started a health care company to create record-sharing software that would make life easier for chronically ill patients and families.",
      "Within five years, President Barack Obama\u2019s White House recognized Gleason as a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d in the industry. When the coronavirus struck in 2020, she was a health care technologist in the first Trump White House who worked grueling hours building data systems to guide the federal response. (And her daughter was a thriving college student.)",
      "Now, her journey has improbably led to President Donald Trump naming her the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, a position that seems to convey extraordinary power. Except almost no one has heard of her and everyone knows the man the president says is actually leading the unparalleled effort to gut the federal workforce and shutter agencies: Elon Musk.",
      "While Musk has claimed his Department of Government Efficiency is fully transparent, until last week the White House press secretary would not even say Gleason's name \u2014 which does not appear on the DOGE website.",
      "In his address to Congress Tuesday, Trump made clear that Musk is in charge, saluting him as the head of DOGE, with Musk smiling down on the president from the visitors' gallery. Yet government lawyers have argued in court that Gleason and not Musk is the agency\u2019s leader.",
      "The confusion has added to the mystery around the role of Gleason, who did not respond to a phone call or text message for comment.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows for sure what her role is and whether she actually has any oversight of any of the people doing the work, or is she just there as a punching bag and a distraction to keep their actual activities shielded from the public,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that sued the DOGE Service and Gleason seeking access to records that would shed light on their operations.",
      "DOGE claims credit for saving more than $100 billion through mass firings, cancellations of contracts and grants, office closures and other cuts that have paralyzed entire agencies. Many of those claimed savings have turned out to be overstated or unproven.",
      "On one level, Gleason fits the mold of a Musk employee, one willing to work arduous hours to meet his goals. Former colleagues say she is an effective behind-the-scenes operator and say her rise is the story of a former nurse who got into health care technology to help patients and doctors and climbed through merit.",
      "\u201cFrom my perspective, I can\u2019t imagine somebody I\u2019d rather have there,\u201d said Jamie Grant, a former Republican lawmaker in Florida who worked with Gleason to start a health care company. \u201cSomebody saying yes to that job right now better believe in the mission and better have a spine and be talented and she\u2019s that in spades.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Gleason had served as the acting administrator at DOGE for weeks. But that was not the widely held understanding of her position internally, according to three people with knowledge of the office\u2019s operation who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "While the exact nature of Gleason\u2019s portfolio was not well defined, what was clear is that she was working closely with DOGE leaders. She attempted to push civil service staffers in the office to hire at least two people who failed screening reviews for prospective hires; both were later hired by DOGE, according to two of the people who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The uncertainty over her role \u2014 and when she was appointed to it \u2014 could have far-reaching implications in a series of ongoing lawsuits filed to blunt the impact of Musk's radical paring of the government workforce.",
      "Under questioning from U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly recently, government attorneys struggled to explain who was in charge of DOGE or Musk's precise role. That led Kollar-Kotelly to wonder if the office was running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause because Musk had not been nominated to lead the office, or received confirmation from the Senate.",
      "The Trump administration announced the following day that Gleason was DOGE's acting administrator, a question they had previously refused to answer.",
      "Unlike many DOGE workers, Gleason has no prior ties to Musk. She recently worked as chief products officer at Nashville-based health care firms founded by Brad Smith, who worked in the prior Trump administration on health care and is also a DOGE adviser.",
      "Smith and Gleason began working on Trump\u2019s transition after the November election, and her role in Trump's orbit has grown. In December, she rejoined the United States Digital Service, where she had previously worked from 2018 through 2021 on high-level government health care technology initiatives.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order rebranding USDS as the US DOGE Service and giving it a mandate to help Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative. Soon, dozens of Musk acolytes associated with DOGE began arriving at agencies across the government demanding access to sensitive data systems and pushing for drastic changes.",
      "While 21 others in the office resigned in protest rather than carry out Musk\u2019s initiatives, Gleason accepted a position that thrust her into an unfamiliar spotlight.",
      "Health care entrepreneur Travis Bond, Gleason\u2019s colleague over two decades at companies in Florida, said Gleason will hate the public attention but excel in her new role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure they could have picked a better person. She just thinks, eats and breathes this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "Bond, Gleason and Grant in 2011 launched CareSync Inc., which developed an app to allow patients suffering from chronic disease to keep their medical records in one place. After benefiting from a $7.25 million grant from one Florida county, CareSync found it hard to attract buyers for subscriptions that cost up to $199 annually.",
      "CareSync pivoted in 2015, taking advantage of a new federal rule that allowed Medicare providers to bill for chronic care management services delivered remotely. The company raised millions of dollars from investors and began rapidly adding staff and serving more than 20,000 patients nationwide. By summer 2018, CareSync ran out of cash and closed without notice, firing 300 workers and leaving creditors owed millions.",
      "Gleason recalled later that she was \u201ctrying to figure out what in the world to do in life\u201d after that experience and applied for the USDS with encouragement from Aneesh Chopra, U.S. chief technology officer under Obama. Chopra declined comment.",
      "She focused on improving technology systems at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the pandemic, she worked under White House response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to develop laboratory and hospital data reporting systems. Birx praised Gleason last week in an interview with CNN as a \u201creally competent, hardworking, focused woman who understands the value of data.\u201d",
      "Near the end of her three-year stint in 2021, Gleason reflected on her work in a podcast interview, saying the digital service sought to \u201cempower the civil servants and to bring new approaches in technology to the government and to help modernize their efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur mission is really to do the greatest good, for the greatest number of people, in the greatest need,\u201d she said."

      "Donald Trump's style of diplomacy is a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.",
      "The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.",
      "For Trump, it\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.",
      "It's not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump's actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe.",
      "He's shaping a foreign policy that's more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren't meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance.",
      "Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.",
      "The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what's-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.",
      "Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump's \u201cledger\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.",
      "Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, \u201cWinning isn't everything. It's the only thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,\u201d Frantz said. \"Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.\u201d",
      "Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten richer, we\u2019ve all gotten older. So I said, \u2019I\u2019ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,\u2019\u201d Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.",
      "Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America's oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks.",
      "In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \u201cregrettable.\" He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \u2014 that Trump wants.",
      "In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials.",
      "But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s push on Zelenskyy \u2014 and pivot toward Moscow \u2014 marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War.",
      "Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden's approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration.",
      "Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.",
      "Kellogg, who also served in Trump's first White House, recalled seeing Trump's \u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president's first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.",
      "\"As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, \u2019What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?''' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event.",
      "The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.",
      "The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit.",
      "The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America's 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump's trade war.",
      "The episode has underscored Trump's willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances.",
      "The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump's move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,\" Trudeau said. \"But Donald, they point out that even though you\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Conservatives have long talked about cutting government, but Republicans in Congress have shied away from approving deep reductions because of fear of how voters would react",
      "DENVER -- For decades, conservatives in Congress have talked about the need to cut government deeply, but they have always pulled back from mandating specific reductions, fearful of voter backlash.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump's administration is trying to make major cuts in government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 an initiative led by an unelected businessman who's unlikely to ever run for office and was appointed by a termed-out president who no longer needs to face voters again.",
      "The dynamic of cutting government while also cutting out those who answer to voters has alarmed even some fiscal conservatives who have long pushed for Congress to reduce spending through the means laid out in the Constitution: a system of checks and balances that includes lawmakers elected across the country working with the president.",
      "\u201cSome members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won't cut spending and decided to go around them,\u201d said Jessica Reidl of the conservative think tank The Manhattan Institute. Now, she said, \u201cno one who has to face voters again is determining spending levels.\u201d",
      "That may be changing.",
      "On Thursday, facing mounting court challenges to the legality of Musk ordering layoffs, Trump told his Cabinet that Musk could only make recommendations about government reductions. And there were more signs that Congress, after sitting on the sidelines for nearly the first two months of Trump's administration, is slowly getting back into the game.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican senators told Musk that he needed to ask Congress to approve specific cuts, which they can do on an up-or-down, filibuster-free vote through a process known as recission.",
      "Senators said Musk had never heard of the process before. That was a striking admission given that it's the only way for the executive branch to legally refuse to spend money that Congress has given it.",
      "\u201cTo make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longtime advocate of spending reductions who said he introduced the idea of recission to Musk during the lunch meeting of the GOP caucus.",
      "Of course, letting Congress have the final word may be constitutional, but it would open up the process to individual representatives or senators balking at cuts because of home-state interests or other concerns, as some have already. But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economist in George W. Bush's administration, said that \u201cmessy\u201d process is a superior one.",
      "\u201cThere's always this instinct in people to insulate decisions from politics,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cIt's a mistake in a democracy. It's really messy. You're not going to get the cleanliness of a corporate reorganization.\u201d",
      "Riedl noted she has advocated for deep cuts for decades, but there's a reason Congress has balked.",
      "\u201cIf Congress won't pass certain spending cuts, it's because the American people don't want it enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I want spending levels to be cut, it's my job to persuade the people of America to agree with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters argue they did just that in the last presidential election when he promised to shake up Washington: \u201cThe people elected me to do the job and I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress last week.",
      "A corporate-style approach to government has long been the goal of conservatives, especially one segment that has recently called for a more CEO-style leader who is less tied down by democratic commitments to voters. Musk has embodied that, bringing the same disruptive, cost-cutting zeal he brought to his private companies. Some of his DOGE moves mirrored steps he took to slash the social media site Twitter, including the email offering buyouts, both times called \u201cFork in the Road.\u201d",
      "Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, said the effort seems more destructive than just an attempt to shrink government in ways conservatives have long advocated.",
      "\u201cIt is usurping the role of Congress on spending and program design, using cuts as a backdoor way to impound and close agencies created by Congress,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cIt is implementing an unprecedented scale of disruption.\u201d",
      "Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist whose pledge to make government small enough to \u201cdrown it in a bathtub\u201d has made him an icon for small-government conservatives, cheered the DOGE project. He said Congress has to authorize any real reductions, but hoped that DOGE's cuts show the legislative branch that voters will not panic when government is shrunk.",
      "\u201cIf we do something for three years, they'll make it the law,\u201d Norquist said of Congress. \u201cThey'll see it's safe, they'll see it's successful. They'll come in and put their name on it.\u201d",
      "Norquist acknowledged that Congress has repeatedly balked at the level of cuts that he would like to see, even under unified Republican control. He asserted that \u201c95%\u201d of Republicans support such reductions but \u201cthat wasn't enough to get it across the finish line\u201d in an era where the majority party usually only has a razor-thin margin of control in either chamber.",
      "The past nearly half-century of politics has been defined by conservatives pledging to cut government spending, only to see it continue to grow. Republican Ronald Reagan swept into the presidency in 1980 pledging to cut government, but when he left eight years later its size had increased. The trend continued through Trump\u2019s first term and during Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "Now, however, Trump will not face voters again, despite occasional quips about seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term. He has been open about his grudge against the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for many of his troubles during his initial four years in office.",
      "\u201cI don't think previous presidents have had the same animus towards the federal government this one has,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.",
      "He noted that Trump has launched a second cost-cutting initiative through traditional channels \u2014 his own Office of Management and Budget, which asked agencies to prepare for mass layoffs. That, Holtz-Eakin said, makes those coming reductions likelier to stick than DOGE cuts.",
      "Holtz-Eakin said there are initial signs of voter discontent over the pace, depth and chaos of the cuts. \"The usual way you visit that on a president is you wipe out his party in the midterms,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cYou never evade the voters.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department is celebrating its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday celebrated its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community, saying the dismissal showed that officials are \u201cdelivering on President (Donald) Trump\u2019s promise to dismantle radical DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs and restore integrity to federal enforcement efforts.\u201d",
      "The dismissal Wednesday of the two-year-old case underscored the Trump administration's commitment to \u201celiminate ideological overreach and restore impartial enforcement of federal laws,'' Justice said in a statement.",
      "At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its formal referral of the case to the Justice Department. The agency said the action aligns with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s pledge to end the use of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as an enforcement tool that Zeldin was too often used to advance liberal ideological priorities.",
      "Dismissal of the case unraveled one of former President Joe Biden\u2019s highest-profile targets for an environmental justice effort aimed at improving conditions in places disproportionately harmed by decades of industrial pollution. Biden\u2019s EPA sued the Denka Performance Elastomer plant in early 2023, alleging it posed an unacceptable cancer risk and demanding cuts in toxic emissions of cancer-causing chloroprene.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana and was formally withdrawn Wednesday.",
      "The action is one of a series the Trump administration has taken as it moves quickly to reverse the environmental justice focus of Biden\u2019s administration, placing roughly 170 environmental justice-focused staffers on administrative leave. Dropping the Denka case relieves pressure on a company that has spent years fighting federal lawsuits and investigations over its impact on public health.",
      "Denka, based in Japan, bought the former DuPont plant in LaPlace, Louisiana, a decade ago. It\u2019s located near an elementary school in a community about 30 miles outside New Orleans.",
      "The site produces neoprene, a synthetic rubber that is found in products such as wetsuits and laptop sleeves. The Justice Department sued the company in early 2023, accusing it of emitting unacceptable levels of chloroprene, a chemical that may be especially harmful to children. A judge had scheduled a bench trial for April.",
      "Dismissal of the case reflects the Justice Department's \u201crenewed commitment to enforce environmental laws as Congress intended \u2014 consistently, fairly and without regard to race,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson, who oversees the department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who took over the EPA in late January, said the dismissal was \u201ca step toward ensuring that environmental enforcement is consistent with the law. While EPA\u2019s core mission includes securing clean air for all Americans, we can fulfill that mission within well-established legal frameworks, without stretching the bounds of the law or improperly implementing so-called \u2018environmental justice.'\u201d",
      "Denka said the dismissal was \u201clong-overdue\u201d and ends litigation that it said lacked scientific and legal merit. The lawsuit was a \u201cdraining attack on our business,\" the company said.",
      "\u201cThe focus should be on the real-world data that shows no adverse health effects, even at substantially higher emission levels,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The government\u2019s lawsuit said air monitoring showed that long-term concentrations near the Denka plant are as high as 15 times the amount recommended for long-term exposure to chloroprene.",
      "The EPA under Biden issued a related rule aimed at reducing industrial pollution that gave Denka a fast deadline to lower its emissions. The company said it was being singled out and other manufacturers were given far more time to comply. The company also said the plant has significantly reduced its emissions in recent years, since the sale was completed in 2015. The company won an extension of its deadline.",
      "The Denka plant is located in an industrial stretch of Louisiana from New Orleans to Baton Rouge that is officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor. It\u2019s known informally as Cancer Alley for the high incidence of cancer among residents who live near the industrial corridor, which has about 200 fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. The area accounts for about 25% of the petrochemical production in the United States."

If we want to continue to have one of the premier fire services in the world, we need to have the National Fire Academy.\u201d",

      "For firefighters, including those on the frontlines of deadly fires that ravaged California this year, having an essential training institution \u201cshut down under the presumption that there\u2019s waste, fraud and abuse\u201d has been demoralizing, Bashoor said. He said losing NFA training could make the coordinated response that prevented additional deaths and destruction in California more difficult.",
      "FEMA and the National Fire Academy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While surveying disaster zones in California in January, Trump said he was considering \u201cgetting rid of\u201d FEMA altogether, previewing sweeping changes to the nation's central organization of responding to disasters.",

      "ROSWELL, Ga. -- A hawk swooped in and landed on a tree, then watched as Michele and Jeremy Davis mourned their murdered son at a vigil outside his high school.",
      "It was one day after their teenager, Carter, was gunned down in a random attack that sent fear through the suburbs north of Atlanta in the summer of 2016.",
      "The hawk stayed as the father spoke. When he finished, it began soaring silently over the crowd, flying just over the heads of Carter's classmates at the tearful vigil, Michele Davis recalled in an interview this week.",
      "Hawks and butterflies would show up later for the Davis family in surprising and unexpected ways. They've been part of a series of events that helped her regain her joy, she said.",
      "Michele Davis is an English teacher at the Lovett School in Atlanta, and one of the latest signs that her son is OK came through a former student, Slater Nalley. He wrote a song about Carter and later made it onto the TV show \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Nalley's performance of \"Traces of You\" will be aired on the season premiere Sunday night, ABC representatives said.",
      "Michele Davis spent one of the last days with her son in her home state of South Dakota, beneath the towering granite peaks in the Black Hills. She and Carter noticed two granite spires touching each other across a ravine, a rock formation known as the Praying Hands.",
      "Three days later, Carter and his friend Natalie Henderson, both 17, were gunned down. It was the night before he was supposed to start his senior year at River Ridge High School in Woodstock, Georgia.",
      "Hours after the killings, Carter's parents gathered with their daughter, 8-year-old Greta, to find a path forward. They'd just heard devastating details of the murders from police detectives. When the police left, they went to their porch and decided to look for messages that signaled Carter was OK, Michele Davis said. To help Greta better comprehend the loss of her big brother, Jeremy Davis explained to his daughter that Carter may send messages that he\u2019s fine in unique ways, such as with feathers or dragonflies.",

      "As Michele Davis spoke with her parents a couple of days after the killings, a yellow and black butterfly landed near them. It reminded them of Carter's love for butterflies.",
      "Carter was also passionate about sports, and hoped to play lacrosse in college. Weeks after the killings, friends and family organized a pick-up lacrosse game in Georgia.",
      "Carter's best friend from South Dakota flew to Atlanta for the game and wore Carter's helmet and jersey. Midway through, players came to a halt. They began pointing at Carter's helmet, where a yellow butterfly had landed.",
      "Days after the killing, Roswell police arrested Jeffrey Hazelwood on two murder counts. Police said he stalked Carter and Henderson as they spent time in a parked car outside a Publix grocery store.",
      "Hazelwood, who was 20 at the time, had climbed onto the roof of the grocery store during the predawn hours on Aug. 1, 2016, to watch them, prosecutors said. He later confronted the teens in the parking lot, shooting both of them in the head, the medical examiner determined. There was no evidence that he even knew them.",
      "After the killings, Hazelwood wore a \u201cGuy Fawkes\u201d mask \u2014 which gained popularity after the 2006 film \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d \u2014 as he filled his car with gas at a nearby convenience store, surveillance video shows. There's no evidence he was wearing the mask during the killings, as there's no surveillance video that captured the teens being shot, police said. Detectives later found writings by Hazelwood that expressed his desire to become an assassin.",
      "Hazelwood pleaded guilty but mentally ill to two counts of murder, and is serving a life sentence in a Georgia prison, according to the state Department of Corrections. Hazelwood has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, his defense lawyers said in court.",
      "A priest who prayed with her and the Henderson family, and the Roswell police detectives who interviewed Michele and Jeremy Davis also gave them comfort in their darkest days, Michele Davis said.",
      "She's also grateful that detectives secured a confession from Hazelwood. He shook uncontrollably as he recounted the crime to a detective, as seen in the interrogation video. The police department's forensic science laboratory now has a plaque on the wall: \u201cIn Memory of Natalie Henderson & Carter Davis. When the innocent cannot cry out for justice, it is our duty to do so for them.\u201d",
      "Last year, Michele Davis shared a poem she had written with Nalley, her former student. Nalley then created a song about Carter and wanted to bring his guitar to school and play it for the class.",
      "\u201cIt was the most magical thing I had ever heard,\" Michele Davis said. Students in other classrooms heard the music. So \"we went on this classroom tour of him singing this song and me sitting there listening to it and crying,\u201d she said.",
      "The song's opening lyric is \u201cYour laugh was like a river running home.\u201d Later, the song evokes the hawks that bring comfort to her: \u201cSomewhere past the sky I can feel you dancing in the air. Every single time I see a bird fly by, I\u2019m reminded you\u2019re answering my prayers.\u201d",
      "Through a friend, Michele Davis was able to find a small group of women in the Atlanta area known as the Warrior Moms, all of whom have suffered tremendous loss.",
      "\u201cAs Americans we shy away from talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just underneath the surface \u2014 this sadness \u2014 that any one second, I can just sit still long enough and break down crying.\u201d",
      "The Warrior Moms plan to share their experiences in a book, \u201cGrieve Like a Mother, Survive Like a Warrior,\u201d set to be released later this year.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to be able to tell our stories that help people find joy again,\u201d Michele Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very intentional with finding joy.\u201d",
      "Another thing she's learned is what she calls \u201cliving in the \u2018and,\u2019\" as in \u201cdark and light, sorrow and happiness, grief and joy,\" she said.",
      "She also plans to keep looking for those unexpected moments, when the memory of her son comes flooding back.",
      "\u201cYou look for the hawks and butterflies,\" she said."

      "A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines challenges the viability of a proposed project snaking through five Midwest states",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines raises questions about the viability of a proposed 2,500 mile (4,023-kilometer) project snaking through five Midwest states.",
      "Summit Carbon Solutions, the company behind the estimated $8.9 billion pipeline, vowed to keep pursuing the project despite South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden's announcement Thursday that he had signed a bill into law that will make routing the line much more difficult. The law bans Summit from forcing South Dakota landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.",
      "Plans call for the pipeline to carry greenhouse gas emissions from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to a spot in North Dakota, where it would be permanently stored underground.",
      "It's unclear whether Summit will pursue legal action but the company said in a statement that \u201call options are on the table\" and the project \u201cmoves forward\u201d in other states. The company promised it would have more news soon.",
      "Large pipeline projects typically rely on eminent domain, with companies arguing that even if most landowners agree to grant access to their property, a project can be scuttled if only a few refuse.",
      "Summit says the company, which has secured over 2,700 easements across the region, has approval for routes in Iowa and North Dakota and a leg in Minnesota.",
      "The current proposed route would cut through nearly 700 miles (1,126.5 kilometers) of South Dakota before entering North Dakota, so rerouting to the east through Minnesota would be a big challenge.",
      "A Summit spokesperson did not respond to questions Friday about whether the company would consider a new route.",
      "The sponsor of the South Dakota bill, Republican Rep. Karla Lems, said Summit could either reroute its pipeline through Minnesota into North Dakota or \u201cnegotiate with landowners in South Dakota\u201d and go around opponents.",
      "Gov. Rhoden said the South Dakota law wasn't intended to kill the project and suggested Summit see it as \u201can opportunity to reset.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is a relatively small part of Summit\u2019s overall project. The only segment approved in the state is a 28-mile (45-kilometer) leg from an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to the North Dakota border. Summit\u2019s project also includes two legs in southern Minnesota that would go into Iowa.",
      "A Minnesota Public Utilities Commission spokesperson did not respond to phone or email messages.",
      "The country's transition to electric vehicles has been slower than many people expected, but most think a shift away from internal combustion engines will eventually happen.",
      "Nearly 40% of the nation's corn crop is brewed into ethanol, which is blended into most gasoline sold in the U.S. Midwest farmers and the ethanol industry therefore see it as essential to have new markets as less of the fuel additive goes to power cars.",
      "They see passenger jet fuel as a potentially huge new market for ethanol. However, under current rules the process for turning ethanol into aviation fuel would need to emit less carbon dioxide to qualify for tax breaks intended to reduce greenhouses.",
      "The carbon capture pipeline is a key part of achieving those goals, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said.",
      "Walt Wendland, who runs an ethanol plant in Onida, South Dakota, said the \u201cethanol industry is a margin business\u201d and the new state law will put South Dakota ethanol producers at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cEver since I built a plant, I never wanted an advantage, just don\u2019t put me at a disadvantage,\u201d Wendland said.",
      "It has been four years since Summit proposed building the pipeline, along with two other companies that later abandoned their plans. It has been a challenging process for Summit, which dealt with lawsuits in Nebraska and elsewhere, opposition before a regulatory commission in Iowa and now the eminent domain ban in South Dakota.",
      "In its statement, Summit expressed optimism about the future but didn't offer specifics about how it could build a pipeline without eminent domain authority in South Dakota.",
      "Since the pipeline was proposed, the federal government\u2019s approach to climate change also has changed dramatically. Democratic President Joe Biden increased tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to encourage carbon capture as an effort to slow climate change.",
      "However, Republican President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for more oil and gas drilling and coal mining, and has put far less emphasis on alternative energy. Trump has not indicated whether his views will lead to changing federal policy regarding carbon capture pipelines.",

    "story": [
      "Early crew members of the voyaging canoe Hokulea have gathered in Hawaii to celebrate the vessel's 50th birthday",
      "KANEOHE, Hawaii -- Hawaii's American colonizers once banned the Hawaiian language in schools. Some Native Hawaiians tried to lighten their skin with lye. Many people believed Polynesian voyagers had simply lucked into finding the islands by drifting on logs.",
      "But a canoe launched half a century ago helped turn Hawaiian culture from a source of shame to one of pride, reviving the skill of traveling the seas by decoding the stars, waves and weather. That vessel \u2014 a double-hulled sailing canoe called the Hokulea, after the Hawaiian name for the star Arcturus \u2014 would even influence the Disney blockbuster \u201cMoana\u201d decades later.",
      "To mark the anniversary, the Hokulea's early crew members gathered Saturday for ceremonial hula and kava drinking at the Oahu beach where the canoe launched on March 8, 1975, and where they began their first training sails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a vehicle of exploration. It\u2019s a vehicle of discovery,\u201d Nainoa Thompson, the CEO of the Polynesian Voyaging Society, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also been our vehicle for justice as Native Hawaiians, as Pacific Islanders, as a very unique, special culture of the Earth.\u201d",
      "In 1980, Thompson became the first Hawaiian in six centuries to navigate to Tahiti without a compass or other modern instruments \u2014 a span of about 2,700 miles (4,300 kilometers).",
      "Thompson, 71, remembers stories from his grandmother, born less than a decade after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. Teachers beat her for speaking Hawaiian, and her uncle tried to wash the brown off his skin with lye.",
      "When she had children, she didn't teach them Hawaiian.",
      "\u201cIf her children tried to be Hawaiian, they would get hurt in the new society,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd so you have to become something else.\u201d",
      "A resurgence of Hawaiian pride and identity starting in the late 1960s and 1970s set off a cultural renaissance. Artist Herb Kane began painting ancient canoes based on drawings from European explorers and got the idea to build a double-hulled canoe with tall, triangular sails similar to those his ancestors had used hundreds of years earlier.",
      "At the time, many people accepted the notion that Polynesians settled islands by accident.",
      "Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl had theorized that Polynesians arrived from South America, pushed west by the prevailing winds and currents. In 1947, he set out to prove it by floating from Peru on a log raft. He landed in the Tuamotu Islands north of Tahiti and wrote a best-seller.",
      "Heyerdahl\u2019s theory took hold even though Hawaiians for generations had passed down stories of people who traveled from the distant lands -- including Kahiki, possibly what is today known as Tahiti \u2014 by canoe, bringing with them edible plants such as ulu, or breadfruit.",
      "Kane, University of Hawaii archaeologist Ben Finney and Honolulu surfer Tommy Holmes wanted to challenge the drifting log concept. They started the Polynesian Voyaging Society, intent on sailing a canoe to Tahiti without modern instruments.",
      "They needed a navigator. Traditional long-distance voyaging skills had all but disappeared, but a Peace Corps volunteer on the isolated atoll of Satawal in Micronesia told them about Pius \u201cMau\u201d Piailug, who had been taught navigation from childhood. Over about a month in 1976, Piailug guided the Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti \u2014 about the same distance from Hawaii to California.",
      "Some 17,000 people thronged the Tahitian shore to greet them and witness what one crew member called \u201cthe spaceship of our ancestors.\u201d",
      "Former Hawaii Gov. John Waihe\u2018e was in his 20s then, and a delegate to the 1978 state Constitutional Convention. The Hokulea\u2019s success spurred delegates to make Hawaiian an official state language even though few residents still spoke it, he said. They also created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to improve the well-being of Native Hawaiians.",
      "\u201cIt helped us believe in everything that we were doing,\u201d Waihe\u2018e said.",
      "Today, two dozen schools have Hawaiian language immersion programs, and Census data show more than 27,000 people in Hawaii, and 34,000 in the U.S., speak Hawaiian at home.",
      "In 1978, an ill-prepared crew set out for Tahiti in poor weather, and the Hokulea capsized just hours after leaving port. Crew member Eddie Aikau paddled his surfboard to get help. The Coast Guard rescued the canoe, but Aikau was never found.",
      "The voyaging society overhauled itself in response, setting clear goals and training requirements. Thompson studied at a Honolulu planetarium and spent over a year under the tutelage of Piailug. In 1980, he navigated to Tahiti.",
      "Thompson said he felt a deep obligation to fulfill Aikau\u2019s wish to follow the path of his ancestors and \u201cpull Tahiti out of the sea.\u201d But he didn't celebrate when the Hokulea got there.",
      "\u201cI just went into a quiet, dark place and just told Eddie we pulled it out of the sea,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no high fives. It\u2019s too profound.\u201d",
      "In decades since, the society has sailed the canoe around the Pacific and world, including New Zealand, Japan, South Africa and New York.",
      "It inspired other Pacific Island communities to revive or newly appreciate their own wayfinding traditions.",
      "In Rapa Nui, Chile \u2014 also known as Easter Island \u2014 islanders have embarked on long-distance canoe voyages. The University of Guam has a navigation program. Similar trends have surfaced in the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga, said Mary Therese Perez Hattori, the director of the Pacific Islands Development Program at the East-West Center.",
      "\u201cWe come from very, very ancient societies,\u201d said Hattori, who is Chamorro, the Indigenous people of the Mariana Islands. \u201cHokulea sort of helped us remind the world of this.\u201d",
      "Hokulea\u2019s influence spread in 2016 when Disney released \u201cMoana,\u201d an animated film about a 16-year-old girl who learns wayfinding about 3,000 years ago.",
      "Thompson spoke to hundreds on the movie's creative team about wayfinding and the importance of canoes to Pacific culture, said Aaron Kandell, a Hawaii-born writer who worked on the movie.",
      "Kandell, who is not Native Hawaiian, spent a year studying navigation with the Polynesian Voyaging Society during his 20s and incorporated that into the script, including where Moana learns to use her outstretched hand to track the stars and runs her hand in the ocean to feel the currents.",
      "Crew members taught animators about coconut fiber ropes so they would look right when Moana pulls on them, Kandell said.",
      "The Polynesian Voyaging Society\u2019s initial plan was to sail to Tahiti once, supporting a documentary, book and research papers. Thompson remembers pushing Hokulea\u2019s hull into the water with the crew back in 1975.",
      "\u201cIt was really a moment \u2014 I didn\u2019t recognize it \u2014 but this was going to change everything,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "An Associated Press journalist has served as a media eyewitness to the execution of Brad Sigmon by firing squad Friday in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- I've now watched through glass and bars as 11 men were put to death at a South Carolina prison. None of the previous 10 prepared me for watching the firing squad death of Brad Sigmon on Friday night.",
      "I might now be unique among U.S. reporters: I've witnessed three different methods \u2014 nine lethal injections and an electric chair execution. I can still hear the thunk of the breaker falling 21 years later.",
      "As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject.",
      "In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.",
      "I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend's parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead.",
      "But you don't know everything when some of execution protocols are kept secret, and it's impossible to know what to expect when you've never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you.",
      "The firing squad is certainly faster \u2014 and more violent \u2014 than lethal injection. It's a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",
      "That's down from 31 last August. After a 13-year pause while South Carolina struggled to obtain the drugs for lethal injections, the state has resumed executions. Inmates may choose between injections, electrocution or the firing squad.",
      "I witnessed Freddie Owens being put to death Sept. 20. He locked eyes with every witness in the room.",
      "I saw Richard Moore die Nov. 1, looking serenely at the celling as his lawyer, who became close to him while fighting for his life over a decade, wept.",
      "And I was there, too, when Marion Bowman Jr. died Jan. 31, a small smile on his face as he turned to his lawyer, then closed his eyes and waited.",
      "I remember other executions too. I've seen family members of victims stare down a killer on the gurney. I've seen a mother shed tears as she watched her son die, almost close enough to touch if the glass and bars weren't in the way.",
      "Like that thunk of the breaker back in 2004, I won't forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on.",
      "I'll likely be back at Broad River Correctional Institution on April 11. Two more men on death row are out of appeals, and the state Supreme Court appears ready to schedule their deaths at five-week intervals.",
      "They would be the 12th and 13th men I've seen killed by the state of South Carolina. And when it is over, I will have witnessed more than a quarter of the state's executions since the death penalty was reinstated.",

      "Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst",
      "DURHAM, N.C. -- Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst.",
      "Like research universities around the United States, the private school in North Carolina's Research Triangle would see a massive loss from Trump administration cuts to grants from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Duke would be among the hardest hit. In its previous fiscal year, Duke took in $580 million in NIH grants and contracts, 11th most among the country's research institutions. The cuts are delayed temporarily by a court challenge, but universities nationwide have implemented hiring freezes, scaled back research and drawn up contingency plans in case the loss in funding takes effect.",
      "Historically, the federal government has negotiated with colleges and universities on its contribution toward their operating costs. If a scientist wins a federal grant to fund their research, the government pays the school an additional amount as a percentage of the grant money.",
      "At Duke, the current rate for these \u201cindirect costs\u201d \u2014 expenses such as utilities and laboratory maintenance \u2014 is about 61%. Last month, President Donald Trump's administration set the rate cap at 15%, significantly less than most universities receive.",
      "The cut in indirect costs is far from the only concern. Funding for new grants also slowed to a trickle after the NIH halted grant application review meetings in January. At Duke, NIH grant and contract award notices plummeted, dropping from 166 in January and February of 2024 to 64 so far in 2025, according to the university.",
      "Already, the uncertainty is causing reverberations at Duke's School of Medicine, which receives over three-quarters of the university's NIH funding. Expansion projects are being shelved. Fewer Ph.D. students are being admitted. And researchers are assessing whether their projects can continue.",
      "The Trump administration has described indirect costs as \u201cadministrative bloat\u201d and said the cuts would save more than $4 billion annually. The change would also free up more money for scientific research, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to slashing the cottage industry built off of the waste, fraud, and abuse within our mammoth government while prioritizing the needs of everyday Americans,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.",
      "Through NIH funding, universities for decades have partnered with the federal government to support scientists\u2019 academic pursuits.",
      "Duke pharmacology and cancer biology professor Donald McDonnell estimates his laboratory has received up to $40 million in NIH funding over 30 years. His lab developed a drug approved in 2023 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic breast cancer.",
      "Upkeep for lab equipment, including machines to grow cancer cells and massive freezers for enzymes and chemicals, would be difficult to afford if indirect cost rates dropped to 15%, McDonnell said. His laboratory also likely will be in the red due to the uncertainty around NIH grants, which would lead to staff layoffs.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I can\u2019t live, I can\u2019t think in this chaos,\u201d McDonnell said.",
      "Duke's total research budget last fiscal year was $1.33 billion, with $863 million coming from the federal government. Without NIH funding, many scientists would have to turn to private organizations and philanthropies, which typically offer substantially less money, researchers said.",
      "\u201cWe have long-standing relationships with private funders and industry partners, and value the contributions they make, but federal funds by far provide the largest single source of research dollars,\" said Geeta Swamy, executive vice dean of the School of Medicine.",
      "The cap on indirect costs also would hinder research for incoming neurosurgery and biomedical engineering professor Nanthia Suthana, who is relocating from the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "To study brain activity and treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Suthana requires a lab large enough for patients to walk around while headsets and monitors capture heart rate, eye tracking, perspiration and brainwaves. Along the walls, 40 to 50 cameras \u2014 each costing about $5,000 \u2014 record their movements.",
      "Her new lab is under construction, but Suthana said she is worried she will have to downsize within a year if funding uncertainties persist.",
      "Duke's medical school has scaled back the number of Ph.D. students it will admit for the upcoming fall semester. Last year, the school brought in about 130 students, said Beth Sullivan, who oversees the school\u2019s 17 biomedical Ph.D. programs. Now, the target is 100 students or less.",
      "That means smaller class sizes over time and, in turn, a shrinking pipeline into medical research careers, she said.",
      "\u201cOur next generation of researchers are now poised on the edge of this cliff, not knowing if there\u2019s going to be a bridge that's going to get them to the other side, or if this is it,\u201d Sullivan said.",
      "Of the more than 630 Ph.D. students in the medical school, nearly all the students in their second year and beyond receive federal support from either NIH or the National Science Foundation.",
      "Third-year doctoral student Caleb McIver was applying for an NIH diversity supplement \u2014 a funding opportunity to encourage professors to train minority students \u2014 when information about the initiative was removed from the agency\u2019s website. McIver, who is Black, is now looking into other NIH grants without ties to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the Trump administration has been wiping out of the federal government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty stressed,\u201d McIver said. \u201cI mean, I need funding, so we need to find it.\u201d",
      "The university had been planning to build a new research building on the site of an old, recently vacated building. Now those plans are on hold, School of Medicine Vice Dean Colin Duckett said.",
      "Even smaller projects like renovating a building floor can\u2019t start because of the budget uncertainty. Hundreds of people working in shuttered labs will consolidate in other buildings. If the indirect costs rate drops to 15%, there also would be widespread layoffs, Duckett said.",
      "Duckett\u2019s job previously focused on recruiting the brightest scientists and providing them with resources at Duke, he said. Now, he has taken on a much different role.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s damage control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how to survive as an institution.\u201d",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease, and his wife died of hantavirus",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead Feb. 26. In the days that followed, mystery swirled around the deaths as authorities ruled out foul play, and immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Then authorities in New Mexico released the causes, proposing a simple but tragic theory for the deaths: Shortly after Arakawa's death from a rare infection, Hackman died of the nation\u2019s leading killer \u2014 heart disease \u2014 apparently unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cI believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case,\" said forensic pathologist Dr. Victor Weedn, who was not involved in the investigation. \u201cIt seemed such a great mystery to the entire nation.\u201d",
      "Here's a timeline of events surrounding the couple's deaths:",
      "Arakawa's last known activities happened this day. She emailed with a massage therapist in the late morning, visited a grocery store in Santa Fe in the afternoon, then went to a pharmacy and a pet food store, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said.",
      "At 5:15 p.m., Arakawa entered the gated community to the home she shared with Hackman. Mendoza said investigators found no other communication or activity by Arakawa after Feb. 11, which they believe to be the day of her death. The medical examiner said she may have been experiencing symptoms of hantavirus before her death.",
      "Hackman\u2019s initial pacemaker data revealed cardiac activity Feb. 17. Subsequent pacemaker investigation showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation Feb. 18, the last record of heart activity.",
      "Based on this information, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said it is reasonable to conclude that Hackman probably died around Feb. 18.",
      "A maintenance worker who showed up to do routine work at the house could not get inside and called a security worker, who spotted two people on the ground inside the home, Mendoza said. The worker called 911 and told an operator he did not know if they were breathing. He and another worker later told authorities that they rarely saw the homeowners and that their last contact with them had been about two weeks prior.",
      "Police found Hackman in an entryway and Arakawa in a bathroom, as well as a deceased dog in a closet.",
      "Arakawa had picked up the kelpie mix named Zinna from Gruda Veterinary Hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure was done, according to the sheriff. He said the hospital visit might help explain why the dog was found dead. A necropsy is being done on Zinna to determine the cause of death, he said.",
      "Two healthy dogs were found on the property \u2014 one inside and one outside.",
      "Autopsies were done on Hackman and Arakawa. Detectives wrote in a search warrant that the couple and the dog had been dead for some time when the maintenance worker discovered their bodies.",
      "Preliminary autopsy results didn't reveal causes of death but showed Hackman and Arakawa were not killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, the sheriff said. The initial autopsies also found no external trauma to either body.",
      "Authorities reveal causes of death for Hackman and Arakawa. Jarrell said both deaths were from natural causes.",
      "Hackman\u2019s death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing. Authorities linked Betsy Arakawa\u2019s death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings."

      "Activists say an Alabama teenager's incarceration in an adult jail violates federal and state laws that require inmates who are minors to be separated from adults",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Djovani Jean-Pierre spent his 17th birthday in a small county jail in rural northern Alabama, where he has languished for more than half the school year awaiting trial.",
      "On the advice of his 51-year-old cellmate, Jean-Pierre avoids contact with others in the jail. The Black teen of Haitian descent has seen inmates with swastika tattoos and witnessed beatings, and he has had no in-person or virtual visits from his parents in the nearly six months he has been behind bars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\" Jean-Pierre told The Associated Press. \"I just stay in my cell.\u201d",
      "His case highlights the potential danger of state laws that automatically send teen suspects to adult detention facilities.",
      "Jean-Pierre is charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree assault and two misdemeanors, and is jailed under an Alabama law that gives judges more discretion to deny bail for some people accused of violent crimes. He had no prior arrests, but if convicted could be sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Local activists and juvenile justice advocates say teenagers incarcerated with adults are more vulnerable to abuse and that Jean-Pierre\u2019s situation clearly violates state and federal laws prohibiting the confinement of minors \u201cwhere they may have sight, sound, or physical contact with adult inmates.\u201d The sheriff says to abide by those laws, Jean-Pierre would have to be held in solitary confinement, which could also be severely damaging.",
      "The number of teenagers in U.S. adult prisons or jails dropped from a two-decade high of 10,420 in 2008 to a low of 2,250 in 2021, according to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics data. Almost 90% of those teens are in local jails where people are typically held prior to conviction.",
      "Prosecutors said \u201cseveral eyewitnesses\u201d saw Jean-Pierre, then 16, use a gun to steal a loaded pistol from someone at a party in September. No gun was fired and no one was injured.",
      "Acting on a tip, a school resource officer detained him during football practice the following day and found the stolen firearm in his bag. Jean-Pierre is also accused of assaulting the school resource officer.",
      "Authorities said Jean-Pierre was arrested for stealing the gun but that there is no evidence he intended to use it at school.",
      "At the time, Jean-Pierre's lawyer said the charges and his confinement were racially motivated, given tensions in Albertville surrounding the small town\u2019s growing Haitian population. Nearly 1,000 people signed a petition attesting to the teen's character and supporting his transfer to juvenile court, where cases are sealed and minors are held in youth facilities.",
      "But Marshall County District Attorney Jennifer Bray said state law and evidence including witness testimony prevented her from charging him as a juvenile. Bray is optimistic she will find a resolution with Jean-Pierre\u2019s attorney that balances accountability with compassion so he can make positive changes in his life, she wrote in an email.",
      "A slew of laws that took effect in 2024 escalate criminal punishments for teenagers, amid a broader return to a tough-on-crime approach nationwide. Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Louisiana made it easier to charge teenagers in adult court. Proponents say these laws increase public safety. Opponents say the changes jeopardize the safety of minors accused of crimes.",
      "In Alabama, laws that automatically send teenagers to adult jails have existed for years, meaning some minors are held in general population with adults in violation of federal law, said Charlotte Morrison, a senior attorney with the Equal Justice Initiative.",
      "Morrison recalled at least five counties where she has worked with or learned of teenagers who were abused because they were held with adults. Adult facilities cannot safely house children and teenagers, she said, and the focus should instead be their reintegration into the community.",
      "Richard Rice, a civil rights attorney representing Jean-Pierre, said the teenager had been a strong student but that he doesn't have access to school materials in jail.",
      "\u201cDjovani deserves compassion and a second chance to learn from this experience rather than subjecting him to unnecessary detainment that fails to serve his best interests or those of the community,\u201d Rice said.",
      "Minors are eight times as likely to experience sexual abuse in an adult jail than inmates over 18, according to the Department of Justice, and are more than twice as likely to die by suicide compared to jail inmates aged 18 to 24. One study found minors who are incarcerated with adults are 33% more likely to die before they turn 39 compared to all other teenagers.",
      "Numerous public defenders, juvenile justice attorneys and advocates told the AP they are shocked that Jean-Pierre isn't separated from adults in the jail.",
      "\u201cWe know it is such well settled law now that you cannot house children with adults,\u201d said Preston Shipp, a former Tennessee assistant attorney general and current policy director for the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. \u201cThis is not a gray area anymore.\u201d",
      "Marshall County Sheriff Phil Sims said the jail doesn\u2019t have the capacity to house Jean-Pierre separately from adults without putting him in solitary confinement.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s more detrimental than anything else, especially to mental health,\u201d said Sims.",
      "He said Jean-Pierre is housed with people charged with non-violent crimes and that he hasn\u2019t had any disciplinary issues.",
      "Jean-Pierre said his original cellmate, who is now in another facility, was an invaluable resource.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my cellmate, Marcus, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cHe just kept being positive, saying \u2018the trouble will pass, take this as a lesson.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jean-Pierre had hoped he would be recruited to play football in college or join the Army.",
      "Now, he said, the uncertainty about his future is the hardest thing to bear.",

The tribes allege in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that they were not consulted when the federal government laid off several employees at the two colleges under the purview of the BIE.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the staff at the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, including nine instructors, were fired or forced to resign in February. The lawsuit alleges that security and maintenance firings have left the campus unsafe, including two power outages in the last few weeks that went unresolved due to the lack of staff.",
      "One SIPI student named in the lawsuit, Kaiya Brown, said in the filing that her dorm was without power for 13 hours. \u201cMs. Brown was forced to leave her dorm residence and drive to a second location to be able to complete her school assignments.\u201d",
      "Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas lost over a quarter of its staff, including \u201cthe Dean of Students, instructors, property management specialists, coaches, tutors, residential advisors, academic advisors, custodians, and food services employees\u201d as well as its only bus driver, the lawsuit states. It also notes that Haskell's student center has been shuttered and students reported their financial aid has either been delayed or has not been disbursed.",
      "Students also reported reduced meal sizes, bathrooms without toilet paper, and classes that are now being taught by deans who do not have the same expertise as the professors who were fired.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China\u2019s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon.",
      "Beijing, which unlike America's close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing.",
      "China\u2019s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump's first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures \u2014 imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more.",
      "\u201cAs Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn\u2019t see other options but to retaliate,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean Beijing doesn\u2019t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.\u201d",
      "As the world's second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong.",
      "After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing\u2019s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China.",
      "All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures.",
      "That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump\u2019s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies.",

      "Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump\u2019s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it's not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a scheduling issue, it\u2019s leverage for China,\u201d said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. \u201cXi won\u2019t walk into a call if there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won\u2019t play the role of a supplicant.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, China is hitting back promptly \u2014 but judiciously \u2014 to each set of tariffs,\u201d Russel said.",
      "At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that \u201cno country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,\" Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that \u201cif you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.\u201d",
      "Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are \u201cnot psychologically shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d tactics.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThese are the kind of things that they\u2019ve anticipated.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump's first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S.",
      "In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen.",
      "\u201cThey are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here.",
      "China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump\u2019s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods.",
      "\u201cBeijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn\u2019t work,\" Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum \"bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.\u201d",
      "Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: \u201cThis is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum also has said that \u201cno one wins with this decision.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Almost two months into President Donald Trump's second term, the chairman of the House Republican campaign committee is already predicting his party will pick up seats in the midterm elections some 20 months away.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., is in charge of increasing the GOP's slim majority in the House, or at least defending it. After Republicans met privately this past week with Elon Musk, Hudson said the cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency are resonating with voters.",

Nevertheless, Hudson said Republicans are confident their budget-cutting is \u201con the side of the angels.\u201d",
      "Here's the political outlook from the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee as he confronts Democrats trying to win back the House in 2026. This Q&A has been edited for brevity and length.",
      "HUDSON: \u201cI just said that, it\u2019s very important that all of us are communicating with our constituents, are very visible in our districts, very accessible. And it\u2019s a shame that Democrat organizations are paying people to disrupt in-person town halls. And so this normal dialogue that we want to have with our constituents isn't possible at in-person town halls. So we need to use technology to reach our constituents.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy biggest frustration as a member of Congress is these massive bureaucracies that hide all their spending and when I ask questions or send letters, ignore it. And now it\u2019s all mapped. You can see it all. There's transparency for the American people. Now we can go in and decide, do we like the taxpayers' dollars being spent on this program? Yes. Let\u2019s keep it. This one? No, let\u2019s cut it. I mean, we actually can do our job.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s exhilarating.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen it comes to the VA, for example, what I\u2019m concerned about is giving world class health care to our veterans in a timely manner. And so any waste, fraud and abuse that makes that difficult or messes that up, I'm interested in cutting.\u201d",

      "Speaker Mike Johnson is teeing up a bill that would generally fund federal agencies at current levels for the remainder of the budget year ending Sept. 30. That would mean defense and non-defense programs would be funded at 2024 levels. Congress must act by midnight March 14.",
      "It's a risky approach. Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That's because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own.",
      "This time, Republicans have hopes of going it alone. They plan to muscle the funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, though the House, and then dare Senate Democrats to oppose it and risk being blamed for a government shutdown.",
      "Crucially, the strategy has the backing of President Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line.",

      "Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year's spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and raising the nation's debt ceiling to avoid a catastrophic federal default.",
      "But Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending.",
      "\"We cannot stand by and accept a yearlong power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on and agencies that keep our communities safe,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But they also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution.",
      "\u201cWe have to wait to see what their plan is,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe've always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.\u201d",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier this week that the Democratic caucus would meet and discuss the legislation at the \u201cappropriate moment.\u201d But he struck a more forceful tone Friday.",

      "\u201cThat is not acceptable,\" Jeffries said.",
      "While continuing resolutions generally keep spending flat, many lawmakers say that failing to keep pace with inflation actually leads to a cut in services.",

      "\u201cI'm open to it,\u201d Burchett said. \u201cBut I want to see what's in it.\u201d",
      "Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster \u2014 and that's assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., has said that passage of the measure covering the remainder of the fiscal year doesn't preclude further negotiations to pass the regular appropriations bills for the budget year.",
      "A Democratic aide speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that such talks have reopened as the two sides try to reach agreement on topline spending levels. The talks could amount to a Plan B should the continuing resolution falter."

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A death row inmate in Louisiana who is scheduled to become the first person in the state to be executed using nitrogen gas has asked for his capital punishment to be carried out using a more \u201chumane\u201d method.",
      "Attorneys for Jessie Hoffman Jr. argued against the capital punishment method of nitrogen hypoxia in a Baton Rouge federal court on Friday.",
      "The hearing occurred a week after Hoffman filed a lawsuit seeking to block his March 18 execution date, when nitrogen will be pumped into a mask strapped onto Hoffman, who was convicted of the 1996 execution-style murder of Mary Elliott in New Orleans.",
      "Among their arguments, Hoffman's attorneys said nitrogen hypoxia is cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution and infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice his religion, specifically Buddhist breathing and meditation exercises. They also argued the method, which involves an industrial, full-face mask, will ignite and worsen his diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia, causing mental torture.",
      "The execution protocol lacks transparency, they argued, noting that under the policy Hoffman's attorneys do not fall under the list of \u201crequired witnesses\u201d to the execution.",
      "Death by firing squad and medical-aid in dying, taking an oral solution of drugs mixed with apple juice, are alternative execution methods that would be more \u201chumane,\u201d Hoffman\u2019s attorneys said.",
      "The only execution methods for carrying out capital punishment listed in Louisiana law are nitrogen hypoxia, lethal injection and electrocution. For nearly two decades, the state has faced legal battles and challenges procuring drugs for lethal injection.",
      "Attorneys for the state say nitrogen hypoxia has proven to be successful in Alabama, noting the method is seemingly painless and an approved method under Louisiana law.",
      "Additionally, Republican officials including Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill say the state is long overdue in delivering justice that has been promised to the families of victims.",
      "The last execution in Louisiana was 15 years ago, when the state used lethal injection to put to death Gerald Bordelon.",
      "After Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature added nitrogen hypoxia to the list of methods to carry out capital punishment last year, officials saw a path to resume executions.",
      "Murrill told The Associated Press last month that she expects at least four people will be executed this year. There are 56 inmates on Louisiana\u2019s death row.",
      "Louisiana is following in the footsteps of Alabama, which has executed four people with nitrogen gas. If Hoffman's capital punishment is carried out as scheduled, Louisiana will become the second state to use the method.",
      "Officials say Louisiana's execution protocol is nearly identical to Alabama, where an inmate is strapped to a gurney and forced to breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask placed on their face, depriving them of oxygen.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama has appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including the AP.",
      "The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said."

    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Gregg's is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Gregg's,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2025, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "story": [
      "Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers.",
      "Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice.",
      "But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\"",
      "Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment.",
      "Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end.",
      "Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley.",
      "'Treated like a thief'",
      "Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction.",
      "\"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\".",
      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

      "\"Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth\", Greene said, adding that there was a \"tonne of uncertainty\" about how Trump's tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives.",

      "Trump's tariffs risk economic turbulence - and voter backlash",
      "Trump mulls exemption for some carmakers from tariffs",
      "Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries.",
      "Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world.",
      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",
      "Bailey said the move would be a \"very damaging thing for the world\".",

      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",

      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits at \"any time and in any convenient format\".",
      "It comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras.",
      "The deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early.",
      "Days later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal.",

      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Trump has changed Ukraine conversation, Starmer says",
      "Zelensky willing to give up presidency in exchange for Nato membership",
      "Why does the US want Ukraine's minerals?",
      "Critical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.",
      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",
      "Trump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough."

    "story": [
      "A bill that had suggested banning smartphones in schools and addictive algorithms aimed at young teenagers has been watered down to gain government support.",
      "Labour MP Josh MacAlister, who brought the private members' bill, told MPs during a parliamentary debate on Friday that reducing smartphone use in law would be a \"process\", not one \"big bang\" event.",
      "The proposed legislation calls for the government to say within a year whether it will raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 - meaning companies could not receive children's data without parental permission until that age.",
      "Data Protection and Telecoms Minister Chris Bryant said the bill's recommendations \"very much chime with what we intend to do\".",

      "Bryant said his department had asked the University of Cambridge to run a feasibility study into the impact of smartphones and social media - and that it would work to \"roughly the same timetable\" as the bill was calling for.",

      "In Friday's debate, Conservative Kit Malthouse, a former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the \"gutting of what could have been a landmark bill\".",

      "Responding to criticism of the bill's watering down in Parliament, MacAlister said it was important that MPs made progress on the issue \"at every possible opportunity\".",

      "Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing.",
      "Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\".",
      "Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life.",
      "Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\"",
      "If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England.",
      "Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK.",

      "Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022.",

      "Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\".",

    "summary": "Teachers and academics in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall hit back against the axing of Latin funding.",
    "story": [
      "Academics from leading universities have condemned the decision to pull a scheme aimed at expanding the teaching of Latin in the state sector.",
      "The \u00a34m, four-year project was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022, but that was ditched by Labour in February with immediate effect.",
      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",
      "The government said it inherited a deficit which meant \"tough decisions were needed\", but Latin GCSE pupils sitting exams in summer would get support.",
      "There are some state schools that still offer pupils the chance to learn a language some describe as dead.",
      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last 10 years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",
      "\"They all like languages, they like history and it's nice to give them an opportunity they wouldn't get anywhere else.\"",
      "Some of her former GCSE students say they have benefited from their insight into the ancient language.",
      "Marianne, who is now in the sixth form, said: \"I want to become a vet and in medicine it's a kind of universal language for all sorts of things, so it's really useful.\"",
      "Classmate Richard said: \"I really enjoyed learning where the words have come that we use in modern English, and so many European languages are all derived from Latin.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School is another that offers the language to GCSE level, but as part of the main school day.",
      "When I visited they had a Latin VIP in their lesson.",
      "Prof Arlene Holmes-Henderson leads a department at Durham University dedicated to promoting the study of Latin and the Classics.",
      "She had a stark statistic to pass on to the Latin learners: \"In the state sector, you have four times more chance of being able to study a classical subject in London and the South East than you do in the North East.\"",
      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
      "She found there were \"three groups of pupils who benefited most - young people with special educational needs and disabilities, students who speak English as an additional language and those who qualify for free school meals\".",
      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin at Key Stage 3, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\".",
      "Prof Holmes-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",
      "\"We are pioneers in this region and we want to share the message with as many people as possible that Latin is for everyone and there is funding available to make that happen.\"",

    "summary": "Yo Yo Honey Singh, who transformed Indian hip-hop, has made a comeback after a long battle with drug abuse.",
    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

      "In December 2020, on the day that investigative group Bellingcat published its expos\u00e9 on the Navalny poisoning, the man who directed the Russian spy cell sent a message saying: \"We'd be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat Christo Grozev.\"",

      "A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: \"Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him.\"",
      "After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties.",
      "They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia.",
      "Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death.",
      "It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was \"warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous\".",
      "He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone.",
      "He thinks the police action sends a signal.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions,\" Dobrokhotov said.",
      "\"So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand.",
      "\"And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand.\"",
      "He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.",
      "Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants \"to change Russia\" because he does not want to live in a country that \"kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government\".",
      "He said that \"while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country\" and that \"we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life\".",
      "\"We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team.\"",
      "On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pled guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents."

      "The 1975 reach top of the bill",
      "Cheshire's The 1975 are festival veterans, who have headlined the Reading and Leeds festival three times since 2016 - but this will be their first time at the top of Glastonbury's line-up.",
      "Balancing hooky dance-rock with more experimental forays into electronica and even ambient music, they pepper their lyrics with references to online relationships, chemical dependency and wry, self-aware humour.",
      "Frontman Matty Healy is known for his provocative, and often divisive, actions. On their recent tour, he has been spotted chewing raw steak, berating security guards via Auto-Tune, and passionately kissing fans in the front row.",
      "More seriously, the band are being sued by organisers of a Malaysian festival, which was shut down after Healy kissed one of his bandmates on stage.",
      "The singer said he was protesting at the country's anti-LGBT laws, under which homosexual acts can be punished by 20 years in prison.",
      "\"I feel like they'll be great headliners,\" said BBC 6 Music's Nick Grimshaw, speaking on the Sidetracked podcast.",
      "\"They have great taste and great vision - and they're a band who will think about do a bespoke show.\"",
      "Olivia's rapid rise",
      "Rodrigo is the first Glastonbury headliner to have broken through in the 2020s - and the second-youngest solo headliner of all time, after Billie Eilish, who was 20 when she topped the bill in 2022.",
      "Like Eilish, the 22-year-old will play the Pyramid Stage with just two albums to her name, but she has a solid armoury of fist-pumping pop-punk singalongs (Good 4 U, Brutal, Get Him Back), alongside lighters-aloft ballads like Driver's License and Vampire.",
      "An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (\u00a3144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury.",
      "Rodrigo last played the festival in 2022, drawing a huge - and noticeably young - crowd to the Other Stage.",
      "During that performance, she brought out Lily Allen to perform the expletive-laden track F You, dedicating it to the US Supreme Court justices who had, a day earlier, ended the constitutional right to abortion in America.",
      "Charli's next Brat summer",
      "Rumours that Rihanna would play the Pyramid Stage turned out to be wishful thinking for the second year running.",
      "But Charli XCX will cement her position as one of the UK's biggest pop stars with her set on the Other Stage.",
      "She returns to the festival after winning five Brit Awards for her deliberately trashy seventh album, Brat.",
      "Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name.",
      "\"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\"",
      "Charli's set also marks the latest step in the star's journey through Glastonbury's smaller stages, starting at the Silver Hayes dance arena in 2014.",
      "\"I was really ill and I forgot to wear a bra on stage, which was good!\" she later told the BBC about her debut..",
      "\"[Radio 1 DJ] Huw Stephens came on during the last song and told me I was singing live on the radio. I lost my voice and it was all a bit crazy, but it was fun.\"",
      "Hopefully she'll avoid the lurgy this summer.",
      "More acts added",
      "Other acts announced for Glastonbury 2025 include Ezra Collective, Jorja Smith, The Libertines, The Maccabees, Franz Ferdinand, Kae Tempest, Beabadoobee, Kneecap and The Prodigy.",
      "Pop star Raye will also play just before Neil Young on the Saturday night, following her breakthrough set at lunchtime on the Pyramid Stage just two years ago.",
      "The line-up so far includes:",

      "Influential soul, jazz and funk producer and composer Roy Ayers has died at the age of 84.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook, his family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4 2025 in New York City after a long illness.\"",
      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",
      "Ayers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.",
      "But he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement.",
      "Happy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations.",
      "Ayers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.",
      "He also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".",
      "More recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\".",
      "Ayers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.",
      "He also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.",
      "Ayers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.",

      "Roy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940.",
      "His mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.",
      "Ayers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.",
      "Jazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets.",
      "Ayers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.",
      "He became a professional musician in 1961.",
      "He went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.",

      "A police force \"acted reasonably\" during a hate crime investigation into a social media post by the Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson, a report states.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) looked into Essex Police's actions after Pearson claimed she felt \"bullied and threatened\" when officers visited the columnist's home on Remembrance Sunday in November 2024.",
      "The force has previously defended its since-dropped investigation over an allegation that a social media post, about the Hamas-Israel conflict, incited racial hatred.",
      "Responding on X, Ms Pearson accused Essex Police of \"marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous\".",
      "In his findings, Mark Hobrough, the NPCC's hate crime lead and chief constable of Gwent, said footage from a body-worn camera showed the investigating officer's approach to Pearson was \"polite and carried out in an exemplary manner\".",
      "The original investigation was sparked by a complaint by a member of the public that a social media post in the early weeks of the Middle East conflict contained critical remarks about the police.",
      "\"The posted image was likely to mislead the reader into thinking this was from a pro-Palestine rally, whether intended to do so, or unintentionally so,\" the report said.",
      "'How dare they?'",
      "The report redacts details of the now-deleted post, from 16 November 2023, which the BBC has seen.",

      "It added: \"Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.\"",
      "X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it was \"not related to Palestine\".",
      "The report, which redacts Pearson's name, stated an officer went to her home and on his recording of the discussion \"clearly states he is there to try to arrange a voluntary attendance interview, to assist the investigation into a complaint of inciting racial hatred\".",
      "Pearson \"began to challenge the officer's actions\", the report adds.",
      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",
      "\"Our view is that the officer's behaviour during this interaction was exemplary,\" the report adds.",
      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",
      "The report praised Essex Police for the way it supported officers and its \"valiant attempt to maintain public confidence\" with its own media releases.",
      "'Totally outrageous'",
      "Pearson did not attend the voluntary police interview and the case was closed when the CPS concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of stirring up racial hatred under the Public Order Act or the Communications Act.",
      "The report noted that the force, on reviewing the CPS decision, concluded that no crime had been committed.",
      "\"We do not take the view that a crime did not take place,\" the report states, \"rather that there was no realistic prospect of conviction based on the evidence available.\"",
      "The NPCC found Essex Police \"acted reasonably\" in its handling of the complaint but the force should have had a \"more active approach\" in categorising the crime, to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme soon after the case was discontinued, Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won't censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\"",
      "The police visit to her home was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\", she claimed.",
      "She added: \"Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader and many other people in the law, in politics, in normal walks of life, have said that is totally outrageous.\"",

      "\"And was rejected instantly by the CPS.",
      "\"A clear breach of my right to freedom of expression.\"",
      "'High bar'",
      "Responding to the report, an Essex Police spokesman said: \"In November last year we launched an investigation into an alleged offence of inciting racial hatred relating to a social media post.",
      "\"We acted appropriately and proportionately and investigated the matter which resulted in us taking no further action.",
      "\"We 're sometimes faced with allegations of crime where people have strong opposing views and that is why it is essential for us to remain impartial.\"",

      "Author Neil Gaiman has described allegations of sexual assault made against him by a former nanny as \"a sham\" and \"invented\".",
      "The Good Omens writer has filed a response to a lawsuit that was lodged against him and his ex-wife Amanda Palmer in February.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich accused Gaiman of raping and assaulting her while she was working for his family in New Zealand in 2022, and is seeking at least $7m (\u00a35.6m) damages.",
      "\"In no uncertain terms, Pavlovich's accusations are false,\" his filing said. \"The sexual scenarios she describes deliberately in graphic detail are invented. Any sexual conduct that occurred was in all ways consensual.\"",
      "Gaiman's legal papers also included WhatsApp messages which he says back up his case, in which Ms Pavlovich thanked him for a \"lovely lovely night\" and told him their relationship was \"consensual\".",
      "The British author's lawyers also said New Zealand police \"thoroughly investigated\" Ms Pavlovich's claims but found \"no merit\" in them and declined to file charges.",
      "In her lawsuit, Ms Pavlovich said she was befriended by Palmer when she was 22 and homeless in New Zealand. She was repeatedly assaulted by Gaiman after she started working for the couple, she claims.",
      "Ms Pavlovich alleges the former couple violated laws on federal human trafficking, with complaints of assault, battery and inflicting emotional distress against Gaiman and negligence against Palmer.",
      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",
      "In response to that article, Gaiman said: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "A spokesman for Palmer has said: \"While Ms Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the wellbeing of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.\"",
      "Ms Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaimain and Palmer in Wisconsin, and against Palmer in Massachusetts and New York.",
      "As well as insisting her allegations are untrue, Gaiman's lawyers say US courts do not have authority to adjudicate her lawsuit because the alleged assaults happened in New Zealand."

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",
      "What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.",
      "\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.",
      "She makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.",
      "There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.",
      "\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"",
      "Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series",
      "Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range",
      "Meghan Netflix show delayed over LA wildfires",
      "Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.",
      "It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.",
      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

    "summary": "Women who have quickly lost weight say strangers are now more likely to smile at them or strike up a conversation.",
    "story": [
      "When Branneisha Cooper was overweight, she felt both invisible and like she stood out.",
      "Her friends would get attention when they were out together, while she was overlooked. But she also had a sense that everyone was staring at her, scrutinising her.",
      "Everyday scenarios were daunting: fairground rides (would she fit in the seat?), working out (would it hurt?), clothes shopping (would she find attractive clothing in her size?).",
      "At the end of 2022, Branneisha, now 28 and working in Texas for a major retailer, began using weight-loss injection Mounjaro. She's lost about six stone (38kg).",
      "Things changed quickly. Suddenly, she could exercise without her body getting sore, colleagues made more small talk with her and she felt comfortable going on adventurous dates with her boyfriend. She was go-karting, dancing and going to arcades - activities that previously made her feel self-conscious.",
      "But despite feeling like she had a \"second chance at life\", weight loss was bittersweet.",
      "\"It was almost like I had stepped into a different world overnight,\" Branneisha recalls. \"People were suddenly more friendly, more attentive, and I was given opportunities and respect that didn't exist before.\"",
      "\"That rapid shift was jarring and really opened my eyes to just how deeply size bias is ingrained in our culture,\" she continues. \"Psychologically, it was a lot to process because while I was the same person, the way I was perceived had completely changed.\"",
      "Weight-loss transformations are nothing new. In the 90s and 00s, they filled the pages of tabloid newspapers, sold celebrity diet regimes and inspired popular TV series like The Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat and Celebrity Fit Club.",
      "But in the 2020s, the advent of weight-loss injections like semaglutide and tirzepatide (marketed under brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro) has meant people can lose huge amounts of weight rapidly, without undergoing invasive surgery. The jabs suppress people's appetites, causing them to feel fuller sooner.",
      "Wegovy has been available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland since September 2023 with strict eligibility criteria, but weight-loss drugs are expected to become more accessible when Mounjaro becomes available through NHS England later this year.",
      "The jabs, which are not suitable for everyone and can have severe side effects, are also available from pharmacies in the UK for people who can't get them prescribed by their GPs.",
      "So other than the physical difference, how does the way you're perceived change when you lose weight quickly and look different to the world?",
      "People who have used the injections have told BBC News that rapid weight loss has caused a massive shift in the way they are treated - by both strangers and loved ones - as well as a change in how they approach their lives.",
      "'Strangers are a lot more chatty'",
      "Branneisha's feeling of sticking out and being overlooked at the same time while overweight is one others can relate to.",
      "When you're overweight, people either avoid eye contact or \"really stare and glare at you\", says Jess Phillips, 29, a primary school teacher from Sittingbourne, Kent.",
      "She previously felt uncomfortable taking flights, travelling on public transport and eating at restaurants. Finding suitable seating worried her, as well as the feeling she was \"taking other people's space\".",
      "People had even shouted \"fat\" at her from cars and at a festival.",
      "A trip in 2023 to Sorrento, on the Italian coast, was a major catalyst for starting weight-loss injections last June.",
      "\"Everyone was staring at me the whole time,\" she says. \"They're just not used to people being that big out there.\"",
      "Since losing weight, Jess has noticed a big difference in how she's treated in public.",
      "\"Strangers seem to be a lot more chatty with me than they ever were before,\" she explains.",
      "She feels \"more invisible in a nice way\", she continues. \"I don't feel like people are looking at me when I go to different places. I feel nicely anonymous... I'm not standing out in any particular way.\"",
      "This is something that Jeannine A Gailey, sociology professor at Texas Christian University, explored in her 2014 book The Hyper(in)visible Fat Woman.",
      "\"My argument is that those who are marginalised, including fat people, become hyper-visible and hyper-invisible\", meaning they're sometimes ignored and sometimes made into a \"spectacle\", she tells the BBC.",
      "Amy Toon, 34, a content creator from Solihull, felt this way. Before starting on the drugs, she shopped online \"because of the overwhelming fear of people looking at me\", she says. \"I just didn't want to leave the house.\"",
      "Since losing weight, \"people are a lot more smiley and just make eye contact,\" she says. \"I never had that before. It's really strange and it's also really sad at the same time.\"",
      "Society has preconceptions about how overweight people are expected to behave, and treats them accordingly, says Caleb Luna, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara specialising in fat studies.",
      "\"Fat people are expected to hide and shrink ourselves and not be proud,\" says Prof Luna.",
      "Weight isn't a protected characteristic in the UK or in most other parts of the world, meaning it isn't illegal to discriminate based on size, except if the person's weight is classed as a disability.",
      "Academics say that anti-fat bias can have significant implications, from how people are perceived in job interviews to how doctors interact with them. People make \"all kinds of personality assumptions\" about other people based on their body size, according to Prof Luna.",
      "\"I don't understand why there's this rage that some people seem to feel upon looking at someone who's overweight,\" says Alix Harvey, a 35-year-old marine biologist from Plymouth who's lost around three stone (20kg) after starting weight-loss injections last year. \"It's socially acceptable to hate fat people.\"",
      "'People see the drugs as cheating'",
      "Weight-loss drugs have helped people like Branneisha, Jess, Amy and Alix lose weight - but they're not right for everyone. Some in the healthcare industry have concerns about the wrong people getting hold of the jabs - including those who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders.",
      "Common side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Rarer side effects include acute gallstone disease and pancreatitis, and the NHS warns that there is also a risk of hypoglycaemia, which happens when your blood sugar level drops too low.",
      "Jonathan Pinkney, professor of endocrinology and diabetes at the University of Plymouth, says while there are \"great expectations and hope around the drugs\", trials show people \"do tend to relapse\" after they stop taking them, meaning the weight loss isn't sustained.",
      "Alix says this worries her. \"Am I going to be treated differently again? Because I like the way I'm currently being treated.\"",
      "Some people who take the medication say there's stigma attached to using the drugs to lose weight, too, which Alix says puts some people off taking the injections.",
      "\"I didn't expect the hatred,\" she says, noting that some people see the use of weight-loss injections as \"cheating\" and a \"socially unacceptable\" way to lose weight.",
      "\"A lot of people see it as the lazy way out,\" Amy says, referring to comments about weight-loss drugs left on her social media videos.",
      "For sustained weight loss, the injections need to be used as part of a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.",
      "\"People think that it's a magic wand then it's not,\" Amy says. \"It doesn't just melt the fat away.\"",
      "\"Even if you injected yourself once a week and a pound a week just evaporated from your body, what would that matter?\" Alix says. \"Why is that cheating?\"",
      "\"You basically can't win,\" she says, referring to the stigma attached to both being overweight and using injections to lose weight.",
      "'The larger me deserved that same attention and love'",
      "People who've lost weight using the jabs tell the BBC their self-confidence has massively improved. Many say they feel much happier to take trains and planes. Some say they now wear brighter colours and tighter clothes. Others say they're more vocal sharing their opinions at work.",
      "Amy says she now feels comfortable taking her children swimming, while Jess says she's been able to book her first-ever ski trip, something she'd never thought was possible before.",
      "\"I actually think it must be annoying how confident I am at the moment,\" Jess laughs.",
      "But many of the women we spoke to were left feeling sad for their previous selves, or frustrated at the unfairness of their past treatment.",
      "\"It's so sad that your weight can define you,\" Amy says. \"I haven't changed at all as a person. The only thing that has changed my appearance.\"",
      "Branneisha echoes these thoughts.",
      "\"It makes me sad when I have experiences that are different now because the larger me deserved that same attention and love,\" Branneisha says. \"Being smaller now makes me sad for my former self because people looked at me differently.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:37:16 GMT",
    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",
      "\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.",

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",
      "\"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added."

    "summary": "\u201cKasibba\u201d, who is non-verbal and had no family to speak for her, was one of hundreds wrongly detained.",
    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

    "story": [
      "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.",
      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",
      "However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.",
      "The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years.",
      "\"But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible,\" she said.",
      "\"Our estimates identify children and adolescents in much of Europe and south Asia living with overweight who should be targeted with obesity prevention strategies.",
      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",

      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",

      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

    "summary": "Measures including linking the pay of senior civil servants to performance are expected to be unveiled this week.",
    "story": [
      "The Civil Service will be reformed under \"radical\" plans to be announced this week, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden has told the BBC.",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said parts of the Civil Service \"would and can\" be smaller, with the government expected to prioritise frontline jobs, like border guards and prison officers. He did not give a figure for reducing staff levels.",
      "As part of the measures, senior staff will have performance-related pay and those failing to meet required standards could be dismissed if they do not improve within six months.",
      "Public sector union, the FDA, accused the government of delivering a \"soundbite, not a credible plan for change\", describing it as a \"re-treading of failed narratives\".",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour's plans were \"weak and anaemic\" compared to what his party had been planning.",
      "He said before losing power in the general election, Conservative ministers had begun a process to reduce the Civil Service by 12%.",
      "Philp added that the previous government, in which he served, had made a mistake in letting the Civil Service get \"too big\".",
      "Six takeaways from Keir Starmer's 'plan for change'Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his pledges?Henry Zeffman: PM and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Six takeaways from Keir Starmer's 'plan for change'",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his pledges?",
      "Henry Zeffman: PM and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "McFadden is aiming to redirect resources from the backrooms to frontline roles, such as border guards and prison officers.",
      "While he avoided setting a figure on how big the Civil Service should be in the future, arguing it \"narrows the discussion too much\" he did say \"the central Civil Service would and can become smaller\".",
      "He also said he wanted to see more civil servants working outside London \"where the state can get better value for money\".",
      "As part of the measures any civil servants performing below expectations may be \"incentivised\" to leave their jobs, with McFadden promising a new \"mutually agreed exits\" process.",
      "For senior civil servants there will be performance-related pay and new measures to tackle poor performance. This will include putting those found to be under-performing on development plans. If there is no improvement in their performance after six months senior civil servants could then be dismissed.",
      "Higher number of digital and data apprenticeships",
      "The proposals will also see one in 10 civil servants employed in a digital or data role within five years, to be delivered through apprenticeships and retraining staff.",
      "Currently there are 25,000 digital and data civil servants, making up 5% of the civil service workforce.",
      "No timescale has been given by the government on when they want to bring in the wider changes to the Civil Service.",
      "Asked if he wanted more civil servants to return to office working, McFadden said he personally thought there was \"value to being in the office\" and it was \"generally a good thing\".",
      "Asked if the government was copying Elon Musk's efforts to reduce the US state, McFadden said: \"Performance management is part of every big organisation, but it's an important thing for you and your viewers to remember: we're a centre-left government.",
      "\"We believe in good public provision, that's why we fought the election, saying we wanted to have more teachers in schools, more neighbourhood police officers, why we wanted to get waiting lists down.",
      "\"That will guide us in our actions, it's up front in our policies, so we will be radical about this, but it's about getting bang for our buck in terms of the outcomes for the public, it isn't an ideological approach to stripping back the state.\"",
      "But Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil servants union FDA, said: \"If the government is serious about transforming public services they must set out what the substance of reform looks like, not just the retreading of failed ideas and narratives.\"",
      "He added meaningful reform \"must put substance before headlines\", and that if McFadden wanted civil servants to focus on delivery - while government departments simultaneously cut resources - \"ministers need to set realistic priorities\".",
      "\"[The] government should get on with the difficult job of setting those priorities rather than announcing a new performance management process for civil servants every other month,\" Mr Penman explained.",
      "Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect union which represents more than 32,000 civil servants, said: \"Nobody would say the Civil Service is perfect, and our members are willing partners in reform, but this government must end the tradition of treating the Civil Service as a political punchbag.",
      "\"A serious reform agenda must start not from blunt headcount targets, but from an appraisal of the specialist skills needed in areas like science and data, and a realisation that the current pay system does not compete with the private sector for these skills.\"",
      "In 2016, the Civil Service headcount stood at 384,000 - the lowest level since World War Two.",
      "However, over the past decade that number has steadily risen, with the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank putting the figure for 2024 at 515,085.",
      "The rise was partly driven by Brexit and making preparations for the UK to leave the EU, and the government's response to the Covid pandemic.",
      "In the coming week, the government is also expected to set out changes to the welfare system, aimed at cutting the overall bill.",
      "Asked on the programme if the government were planning to make changes to disability benefits, McFadden said: \"They will be part of this discussion.\"",
      "\"We don't believe it is good that if somebody could work with a bit of support that they're left to live a life on benefits.\"",
      "He said 2.8 million people were currently on long-term sickness benefits and added that, if the government did not act, the level would rise to more than four million.",

      "The Conservatives have said the Human Rights Act should no longer apply to immigration decisions.",
      "They are calling for a change in the law that would stop people challenging their deportation on human rights grounds in the UK courts.",
      "Leader Kemi Badenoch has previously criticised how some foreign criminals and illegal migrants were using the act to avoid deportation.",
      "A Home Office source told the BBC the Conservatives had left the asylum system in chaos and their suggestion would be totally unworkable.",
      "The Human Rights Act was passed by a previous Labour government, and incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into British law.",
      "The ECHR has been a hotly debated topic within the Conservative Party - with some on the right wanting the UK to pull out of the treaty completely.",
      "The act has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants deemed to be in the UK illegally, and it stopped flights carrying asylum seekers taking off for Rwanda.",
      "Badenoch has not proposed leaving the ECHR, but has argued some foreign criminals and migrants in the UK illegally have successfully used the act to avoid deportation - saying, for example, this would undermine their right to family life.",
      "She also believes some judges generously interpret the provisions of the act when rejecting deportation.",
      "The Conservatives are suggesting an amendment to the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill - which is currently at the committee stage - that would disapply the act in immigration cases.",
      "The policy would give her a clear political dividing line with Labour.",
      "Under the ECHR, migrants could still appeal against deportation to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Conservatives' proposal \"looks like an outsourcing\" of immigration decisions to the Strasbourg court.",
      "\"I don't think that really deals with the issue and I'm afraid it's symptomatic of the kind of gimmicks without action that we saw for a long, long period of time,\" he said.",
      "Later in the programme, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp defended the proposal, saying it would make a \"very big difference\". He said judges have expanded definitions under the EHCR \"in ways that defy common sense\".",
      "\"Of course we believe in rights, but where you have courts just constantly expanding the definition in a way that was never contemplated at the beginning...it gets out of hand,\" he said.",
      "Philp said membership in the ECHR requires \"proper consideration\", which the Conservatives will be thinking about \"in a very carefully considered manner in the coming months\".",
      "UK may have to leave human rights treaty, says Badenoch",
      "Stop the Boats slogan was too stark, Rishi Sunak tells BBC",
      "Badenoch said the amendment she is suggesting would be \"critical to shift immigration powers from the courts to Parliament and elected ministers, enabling more effective control over our borders\".",
      "\"Operating in Britain's national interest means recognising the government's primary purpose: defending our borders, values, and people. Our amendment aims to restore control and prioritise national security,\" she said.",
      "The Home Office source said: \"The Tories left the asylum system in utter chaos.",
      "\"They had 14 years to make changes and instead spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the failed Rwanda scheme, as small boat crossings hit a record high.",
      "\"This amendment is totally unworkable.",
      "\"Instead of dealing with mad proposals that will never work, the Labour government is getting a grip of the asylum system, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, saving millions on asylum hotels and looking at ways of tightening the application of Article 8 to ensure the system works more effectively.\"",
      "The ECHR was established in 1950 by a number of countries including the UK.",
      "The treaty, which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries, is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.",

      "Abramovich sold Chelsea in 2022, after he was sanctioned by the UK government over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn raised was meant to be used for humanitarian causes linked to the Ukraine war but it remains frozen in a UK bank account.",
      "Labour ministers are coming under increasing pressure to meet Abramovich's representatives or the members of the foundation that was set up to manage the funds.",
      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC its officials are in talks with Abramovich's representatives.",
      "But multiple sources said there have been no meetings between any Labour ministers and members of the foundation set up to oversee the funds since the general election last year.",
      "Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse.",
      "One source said: \"For three years, the government has been saying it's been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example.\"",
      "The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundation's board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.",
      "Abramovich's representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club.",
      "The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UK's overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 2024/25, the UK is sending \u00a3282m in aid to Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn - and the interest accrued on the funds - would make up for some of the money taken from the aid budget, which was \u00a315.3bn in 2023.",
      "Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: \"This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years.\"",
      "The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers.",
      "Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.",
      "At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", and his position has not changed.",
      "Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the \u00a32.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him.",
      "He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.",
      "Sources said Abramovich's lawyers have insisted on using the money for all victims of the war in Ukraine including those outside the country, but the UK government has pushed back and argued the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside the war-torn country.",
      "Portugal has also had a say in the matter because Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and has been sanctioned by the EU.",
      "Elusive resolution",
      "The Portuguese authorities issued an exemption to the EU sanctions to allow the Chelsea funds to be used for \"exclusively for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine\".",

      "\"The conditions under which the sale was authorised by the Portuguese authorities and which was accepted by the UK authorities must be respected and cannot be changed retroactively.",
      "\"The humanitarian needs in Ukraine remain extremely high.\"",
      "Members of the foundation, which is headed by Mike Penrose, the former boss of Unicef UK and Norwegian diplomat Jan Egeland, met former Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his deputy Andrew Mitchell in the spring last year.",
      "Those with knowledge of the situation said the outcome of the meeting left a positive impression that the stalemate could be ended by allowing some of the funds to be used on humanitarian causes outside Ukraine.",
      "The BBC understands the former foreign secretary believed a workable solution was in progress and a statement of intent about how the funds would be used was being drawn up by the foundation.",
      "Lord Cameron had spoken to the European Commission about the proposal and had sought buy-in from Downing Street to sign off the agreement.",
      "But there was no resolution to the dispute before last year's general election and there have been no meetings with any ministers since Labour took office.",
      "'Working hard'",
      "The foundation has a plan ready to roll out immediately once the funds have been unlocked.",
      "There have been talks about programmes to help orphans of Ukrainian soldiers and cover health, housing and education needs for those fleeing the war.",
      "A report by a House of Lords committee last year said the government's failure to release the funds to support Ukraine was \"incomprehensible\".",
      "This week, The Guardian reported ministers were preparing to take Abramovich to court to free up the money.",
      "Meanwhile, western countries are using the interest on frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine and there is talk of seizing them.",

      "\"The proceeds are currently frozen in a UK bank account while a new independent foundation is established to manage and distribute the money.",

      "Speaking during a debate on legislation to allow a Holocaust memorial and learning centre to be built in Westminster, with public funds used to pay for it, Lord Hamilton said: \"I do not understand why the government have volunteered taxpayers' money, when there is so little of it, to finance this.",
      "\"The Jewish community in Britain has an awful lot of money. It has a lot of education charities that would contribute towards this. I do not understand why they should not pay for their own memorial.\"",
      "Challenged by Lord Austin that the memorial was \"for everybody\" not just the Jewish community, Lord Hamilton added: \"I take that point, but the driving forces behind putting up this memorial are the Jewish people in this country.",
      "\"They are people who have property everywhere. I do not see why they should not fund it.\"",
      "The former minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major withdrew his comments the following day and said in a statement: \"My remarks were not intended to be antisemitic and I apologise unreservedly.",
      "\"With retrospect having read my comments, I realise that my remarks were insensitive and I apologise. I intend to meet with groups from the Jewish community in order to better understand how to communicate about issues affecting British Jews.\"",
      "His original remarks were criticised by the Antisemitism Policy Trust, who said they were \"ill-judged, racist and false\".",
      "During the debate, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said: \"The Holocaust is not something that is just about the Jews.\"",
      "He added that Lord Hamilton's comments were \"probably a pretty eloquent contribution as to why we need this memorial - and near Parliament\".",
      "Former Labour MP and crossbench peer Lord Austin described the remarks as \"disgusting racism\" and called on the Conservative Party to take \"proper action\".",
      "\"The Tories were quick to demand Labour took action on antisemitism and quite right too,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "\"But they must now do the same themselves.\"",
      "Plans for a Holocaust memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens in Westminster were first announced under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron in 2016.",
      "A bill to remove restrictions on the memorial being built in the gardens and to allow public funds to be used for it is currently making its way through Parliament.",

    "story": [
      "More than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies.",
      "In an open letter, first reported by the Financial Times, they said \"ill considered\" ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance.",
      "They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the government's drive to boost economic growth.",
      "It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-term",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "Leading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending.",
      "The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid.",
      "However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sector's access to finance.",
      "They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven \"positive change\" in the economy.",
      "But they added that financial institutions should \"rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment\".",
      "The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects.",
      "'Way of life'",
      "Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches.",
      "But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022.",
      "The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is \"nothing more ethical than defending our way of life\".",
      "The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in \"good, high-quality, well-run defence companies\" was compatible with ESG considerations.",
      "Banking rules",
      "In their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced \"unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK,\" echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance.",
      "ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans.",
      "These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.",
      "The group has also said defence companies can often find it harder to provide relevant documents to banks because of national security considerations.",
      "Finance UK, a group representing British banks, acknowledged that compliance rules could prove \"complex\" but said banks provided a \"significant range of support\" to defence companies.",
      "David Raw, the group's managing director for commercial finance, added: \"We are continuing to engage with government and the defence sector to tackle any barriers that do arise.",
      "\"We do not see a tension between supporting ESG goals and supporting the defence sector.\"",
      "The UK-based Campaign Against the Arms Trade said it opposed any change to ESG rules on defence firms, adding it would benefit firms that \"make vast profits from death and destruction across the world\"."

    "story": [
      "A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.",
      "Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.",
      "The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.",
      "The BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.",
      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",
      "The software has been banned by Scotland Yard.",
      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",
      "\"It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests,\" he said.",
      "The CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.",
      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",
      "A spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.",
      "They said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"",
      "Author Martin Rosenbaum, a former FOI lead for the BBC, said the performance of police forces when it came to handling FOI requests had \"seriously deteriorated\".",
      "\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Surrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.",
      "The ICO spokesperson said there was nothing to stop public bodies like the police seeking advice from a central body on how to correctly interpret the law, but it must not stop them meeting deadlines for responses or any other FOI requirements.",

      "The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced.",

      "The pie's status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).",

      "He said: \"In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford.\"",
      "But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr O'Callaghan said.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan added: \"We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough.\"",
      "However, he said the producer - Saxby's - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal.",
      "\"It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies,\" he added.",
      "He said the association was \"disappointed\" the application was rejected \"because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area\".",
      "Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between \"the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 [to the south], the Great North Road the A1 [to the east], the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar\".",
      "Defra's notice rejecting the application said: \"The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation.",
      "\"This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation.\"",
      "It added: \"The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area.\"",

      "At an event in London on Tuesday, High Commissioner Phil Goff compared efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which allowed Adolf Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia.",
      "Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: \"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?\"",
      "His comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.",
      "His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.",
      "He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats.",
      "Mr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\"",

      "\"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying.",
      "\"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about.",
      "Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.",
      "Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.",
      "When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\"",
      "The 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government.",
      "Luxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\".",

    "story": [
      "Four former British ambassadors to the United States have expressed concern about the future of intelligence sharing with the US following the re-election of Donald Trump.",
      "Sir David Manning, who served as ambassador between 2003 and 2007, told a parliamentary committee some of Trump's appointees had \"strange track records\" which would create a \"problem on the intelligence front\".",
      "Dame Karen Pierce, who only left the role last month, said intelligence sharing would continue \"even if at the top level there might be things we might wish to be circumspect about\".",
      "Sir Nigel Sheinwald, ambassador from 2007 to 2012, said the relationship would be \"trickier to handle than probably at any other time\".",
      "He said some of the people appointed by Trump to lead intelligence and security could \"present some difficulties in terms of their view of us and views of co-operation\".",
      "He did not specify who he was referring to, however concern has been raised about the US president's pick to be his director of national intelligence.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard has previously echoed Russia's justification for invading Ukraine and her appointment to the role was welcomed by Russian state media.",
      "Earlier this year Lewis Lukens, a retired American diplomat, told the BBC that Gabbard's \"dubious judgement\" could give allies \"reason to question how safe it is to share intelligence with the US\".",
      "During her confirmation hearing with US senators, Gabbard dismissed suggestions she was \"Putin's puppet\" as \"lies and smears\".",

      "Five takeaways from Gabbard and Patel's confirmation hearings",
      "The ambassadors' warnings came during an evidence session with the House of Lords' International Relations and Defence Committee which heard from four former British diplomats to the US.",
      "Sir David told peers that if the UK wanted to be the \"go-to ally\" for the United States it had to have \"something to offer\".",
      "He said the UK's military resources were stretched and the \"defence card\" was \"not the ace it once was\".",
      "Lord Soames said the UK was still \"very, very, very good\" at intelligence and security and asked if that would still play a role in the UK-US relationship.",
      "Sir David said the question of intelligence-sharing was going to be \"more difficult to approach\".",
      "\"Clearly if you have some Trump supportees in these key jobs who have very strange track records and have said very strange things about Nato allies and the Nato alliance and you have people in the administration who seem to be looking for ways of appeasing Russia then you have a problem on the intelligence front.",
      "\"That is a big question mark against how the special relationship is sustained during the Trump administration.\"",
      "Dame Karen said the way the US and UK helped each other was \"unique\" adding: \"There is an interoperability that you don't find with any other ally.\"",
      "Asked if that would last under the Trump presidency, she replied: \"The intelligence part of the relationship is so valuable it will last \u2013 even if as David was explaining - at the top level there might be things we might wish to be a bit circumspect about.\"",
      "Sir Nigel said \"the nature of the people at the top of the US intelligence and security apparatus today - the ones chosen by President Trump - I think that may present some difficulties in terms of their views of us and views of co-operation.\"",
      "\"This is going to be trickier to handle than probably at any other time.\"",
      "Sir Peter Westmacott, who was in Washington from 2012 to 2016, said problems might be caused by a changing culture in US government institutions adding that \"a lot of very good people are being thrown out because they do not pass the loyalty test.\"",
      "However, he also told the committee that it was not unheard of for intelligence to occasionally be held back from allies \"even when you have the most perfect working political relationship\".",
      "\"There are moment when because of the risk of an inadvertent leak to a journalist or something specific source information for example is held back.\""

      "There are only two countries that have publicly said that they would provide troops, the UK and France, neither of which the vice president mentioned.",
      "But plenty in the UK were outraged by the remarks, whether they were a reference to Britain or not.",
      "And the government found a mechanism, in co-opting and reviving a recent ritual, but this time to mark anniversaries, to make its view clear too.",
      "When us reporters asked the prime minister's team afterwards why they had done it, they stuck rigidly to their strategy: don't commentate.",

    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC.",
      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",

    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",

      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",

      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",

      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",

      "It is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.",
      "\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\"."

    "story": [
      "Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.",
      "Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.",
      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",
      "Southwest US most affected",
      "Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.",
      "\"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,\" Prof Grames explained.",
      "The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.",
      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",
      "\"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "She also stressed the need for government action.",
      "\"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.\""

    "summary": "Scientists have found a genetic cause of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",
      "Dr Raffan explained: \"It alters the predisposition to weight gain because it's tweaking a system that is involved in regulating how hungry we feel and how much energy we burn off.\"",
      "The findings could help in the future development of new drugs to tackle obesity. But the scientists say they reveal how much harder people - and owners of dogs - with this genetic predisposition have to work to offset its effects.",
      "Another member of the research team, Alyce McClellan, from Cambridge University  added that the results emphasised \"the importance of fundamental brain pathways in controlling appetite and body weight\".",

      "What we've identified here is a different pathway [from the one targeted by those drugs],\" explained Dr Raffan.",
      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",
      "\"It's about the fact that some people are prone to weight gain because they have a genetic risk which increases their responsiveness to food and their appetite.",
      "\"This goes for dogs and humans alike -  they have a genetic drive to overeat.\""

      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",

      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",

      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",

      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",

      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",
      "\"We are on track to have the first cold adapted elephant by 2028 and that would mean having the first embryos by the end of 2026,\" he said.",
      "\"Over time we are going to have this entire lineage of cold adapted elephants that we can put back into the wild that can interbreed\"",
      "The woolly mice had eight of their genes modified: seven were adapted mice genes related to hair growth and the eighth was a mammoth gene related to increasing body fat.",
      "The researchers found that the animals had longer, curlier hair, but no evidence that the mammoth's fat-increasing gene had an effect.",
      "Colossal Biosciences work has been met with scepticism from scientists not employed by the company. Their concerns include:",

      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",

      "Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.",
      "Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", said Dr Jarrell.",

      "Gene Hackman loved acting but 'hated everything that went with it'",
      "Gene Hackman loved acting but 'hated everything that went with it'",
      "Hackman had \"significant heart disease, and ultimately that's what resulted in his death\", Dr Jarrell said, adding that he had had chronic high blood pressure.",
      "He had not eaten anything recently, but had shown no indications of dehydration, she added.",
      "At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare.",
      "HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled.",
      "She noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities.",
      "Dr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered \"low\".",
      "Investigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "The couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window.",
      "The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.",
      "Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit.",
      "Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory.",
      "Citing privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive.",
      "The cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus.",
      "Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (\u00a33m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.",
      "Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.",
      "Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.",
      "He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.",
      "A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.",
      "He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.",
      "His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico."

      "People affected by leprosy in Nigeria should be able to get hold of vital drugs to treat the disease for the first time in a year from this weekend, the World Health Organization has said.",
      "The country, which reports more than 2,000 new cases a year ran out of supplies partly because drugs were held up after new regulations were introduced.",
      "The WHO said it had asked Nigeria to briefly lift its new testing policy and it expects the drugs to arrive from India on Sunday.",
      "Leprosy is curable with a combination of different antibiotics, but if left untreated the patients' health can deteriorate with sores and nerve damage that cause deformities.",
      "The treatment can last between six and 12 months.",
      "But because of the lack of drugs in Nigeria, patients have been sent home from hospitals. As the drugs suppress transmission this increases the risk of the disease spreading.",
      "Dr Samimu Msheliza, a public health expert and medical advisor at the Nigerian branch of the Leprosy Mission, highlighted the urgent need for medication.",
      "\"We have thousands of newly diagnosed leprosy patients across various cities who are just waiting for this drug,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The quicker we have [the drugs], the better, because currently these people are suffering, their transmission is ongoing because they are not being treated,\" Dr Msheliza said.",

    "story": [
      "Fighting back the tears, 22-year-old rubbish collector Okuku Prince recalls the moment his best friend's lifeless body was found at a massive rubbish dump in Uganda's capital, Kampala.",
      "The landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.",
      "\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Many of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.",
      "A blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.",
      "When government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.",
      "It was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.",
      "\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.",
      "Unable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.",
      "Youth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.",
      "\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"",
      "The collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.",
      "The houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.",
      "Compensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.",
      "Officials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).",
      "Some argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.",
      "\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.",
      "The Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.",
      "As Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.",
      "On the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still.",
      "Birds of prey can be seen flying overhead.",
      "The city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.",
      "But the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.",
      "\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.",
      "\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"",
      "Yet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.",
      "Had that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.",
      "So, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?",
      "The answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.",
      "Ultimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.",
      "The KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.",
      "\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.",
      "\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"",
      "There is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.",
      "It did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".",
      "A month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.",
      "James Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.",
      "At present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.",
      "But they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.",
      "\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.",
      "\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"",
      "Experts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.",
      "And for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.",
      "\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.",
      "It was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.",
      "There are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.",
      "Now Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.",
      "Gurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.",
      "About 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.",
      "US Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"",
      "\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"",
      "Opposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.",
      "Gurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"",
      "An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.",
      "But on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.",
      "\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "In the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police.",
      "Gurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.",
      "\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "While the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.",
      "\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.",
      "\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"",
      "Gupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.",
      "He said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.",
      "Then he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.",
      "On 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.",
      "Gurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.",
      "From Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.",
      "A dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.",
      "\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"",
      "Each group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.",
      "At night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.",
      "\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.",
      "\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"",
      "When they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.",
      "Gurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.",
      "\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.",
      "Once in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "During the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.",
      "If they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime.",
      "This is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.",
      "Instead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.",
      "In their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.",

    "story": [
      "If you had asked Canadians a few months ago who would win the country's next general election, most would have predicted a decisive victory for the Conservative Party.",
      "That outcome does not look so certain now.",
      "In the wake of US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has surged in the polls, shrinking the double-digit lead their Conservative rivals had held steadily since mid-2023.",
      "The dramatic change in the country's political landscape reflects how Trump's tariffs and his repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" have fundamentally altered Canadian voters' priorities.",
      "Trump's rhetoric has \"pushed away all of the other issues\" that were top of mind for Canadians before his inauguration on 20 January, notes Luc Turgeon, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.",
      "It has even managed to revive the once deeply unpopular Trudeau, whose approval rating has climbed by 12 points since December. The prime minister, of course, will not be in power for much longer, having announced his resignation at the start of the year.",
      "On Sunday, his Liberals will declare the results of the leadership contest to determine who takes over a party running a precarious minority government. The new leader will have two immediate decisions to make: how to respond to Trump's threats, and when to call a general election. The answer to the first dilemma will surely influence the second.",
      "Who is in the running to replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?",
      "A federal election must be held on or before 20 October, but could be called as early as this week.",
      "Polls indicate that many Canadians still want a change at the top. But what that change would look like - a Liberal government under new leadership, or a complete shift to the Conservatives - is now anyone's guess, says Greg Lyle, president of the Toronto-based Innovative Research Group, which has been polling Canadians on their shifting attitudes.",
      "\"Up until now, it was a blowout for the Conservatives,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "That is because the centre-right party led by Pierre Poilievre, has been effective in its messaging on issues that have occupied the Canadian psyche for the last few years: the rising cost of living, housing unaffordability, crime and a strained healthcare system.",
      "Poilievre successfully tied these societal problems to what he labelled Trudeau's \"disastrous\" policies, and promised a return to \"common sense politics\".",
      "But with Trudeau's resignation, and Trump's threats to Canada's economic security and even its sovereignty, that messaging has become stale, Mr Lyle says. His polling suggests the majority of the country is now most afraid of Trump's presidency and the impact it will have on Canada.",
      "Trump's 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the US, some of which have been paused until 2 April, could be devastating for Canada's economy, which sends three-quarters of all its products to the US. Officials have predicted up to a million job losses as a result, and Canada could head into a recession if the tax on goods persists.",
      "Trudeau left no doubt how seriously he is taking the threat, when he told reporters this week that Trump's stated reason for the US tariffs - the flow of fentanyl across the border - was bogus and unjustified.",
      "\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" the prime minister warned.",
      "\"In many ways, it's an all encompassing, fundamental issue about the survival of the country,\" Prof Turgeon tells the BBC. Who is best placed to stand up for Canada against Trump has therefore become the key question in the forthcoming election.",
      "The Conservatives are still ahead in the polls, with the latest averages suggesting 40% of voters back them. The Liberals' fortunes, meanwhile, have been revived, with their support climbing to slightly over 30% - up 10 points from January.",
      "Liberals have attempted to highlight similarities between the Conservative leader and Republican president. At last week's leadership debate, candidates referred to Poilievre as \"our little version of Trump here at home\" and said he was looking to \"imitate\" the US president. A Liberal Party attack ad juxtaposed clips of the two using similar phrases such as \"fake news\" and \"radical left\".",
      "There are clear differences, however, between the two politicians, in terms of style and substance. And Trump himself has downplayed any parallels, telling British magazine The Spectator in a recent interview that Poilievre is \"not Maga enough\".",
      "Still, polls suggest a slipping of Conservative support. A recent poll by national pollster Angus Reid indicates Canadians believe Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is better equipped to deal with Trump on issues of tariffs and trade than Poilievre.",
      "The former central banker for both Canada and England is touting his experience dealing with economic crises, including the 2008 financial crash and Brexit.",
      "And the shift in the political mood has forced Conservatives to recalculate their messaging.",
      "If the election is called soon, the campaign will take place at a moment when Trump's threats have inspired a fierce patriotism among Canadians. Many are boycotting American goods at their local grocery stores or even cancelling trips to the US.",

    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", she argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

      "\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"",
      "The current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.",
      "Although surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.",
      "But Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.",

      "\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"",
      "In terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.",

      "\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.",
      "\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.",

    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

      "Subscribers to Joshuanette Francis's YouTube channel \u2013 set up to document her journey after being diagnosed with osteoarthritis at just 24 \u2013 did not see the tears.",
      "Neither were they privy to the days when she tackled the most acute personal struggles, alone behind closed doors.",
      "After being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.",
      "Consistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.",
      "Six years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.",
      "She channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges.",
      "\"Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability,\" Joshuanette tells the BBC.",
      "Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?\" Joshuanette says.",
      "Good Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.",
      "The latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.",
      "Good Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.",
      "She says working with the organisation has been life-changing.",
      "\"There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,\" Kelisha enthuses.",
      "She hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.",
      "\"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,\" she says.",
      "There have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.",
      "\"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,\" Joshuanette says passionately. \"I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.\"",
      "Plans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.",
      "Still, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.",
      "\"Accessibility is a serious concern,\" says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. \"For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully.\"",
      "Both Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.",
      "\"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,\" Bernard says. \"And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.\"",
      "Bernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.",
      "\"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,\" he explains. \"We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,\" he adds.",
      "Kelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.",
      "\"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,\" she says.",
      "The Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.",
      "\"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,\" Kelly adds.",
      "Joshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.",
      "She continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.",

    "story": [
      "Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu.",
      "That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico.",
      "For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is \"pretty set in stone,\" even if the tariffs themselves are not.",
      "\"I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,\" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. \"I think it's an important thing to do.\"",
      "This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war.",
      "Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's \"I Am Canadian\" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's \"51st state\" rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not the 51st anything,\" declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada.",
      "Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal caf\u00e9 changing the Americano on their menu to a \"Canadiano\" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country.",
      "Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming \"the 51st state\", as Trump has suggested many times.",
      "The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of \"treason,\" \"sedition\" and even \"betrayal\".",
      "Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done.",
      "After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown \"too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes.",
      "\"I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person,\" he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump.",
      "\"He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies,\" Ford said.",
      "Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table.",
      "\"You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand,\" said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, \"but what does that mean?\" he asks.",
      "\"Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day.\"",
      "The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist.",
      "The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses.",
      "Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.",
      "\"The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment,\" Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are \"not going to want to spend a dime anywhere\" until they have some clarity.",
      "Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion.",
      "That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018.",
      "While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karen Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for \"families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison\".  Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become \"the 51st state.\"",
      "\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday.",
      "Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally.",
      "The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest \"undefended\" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty.",
      "\"We've been allies for 100 years,\" he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine.",
      "\"We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies,\" Prof Gillezeau says. \"I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see.\"",
      "The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State.",
      "Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (\u00a315.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone.",
      "Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that \"Canada needs to find friends elsewhere\".",

      "John Mulaney is a comedy superstar finding the funny in the familiar.\u00a0 At 42, he already has five highly-rated specials to his name \u2026 three primetime Emmys \u2026 and a reputation as one of the best stand-up guys in the game.",
      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before.

    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard.

    "summary": "In 1996, a group of elderly, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded an album that became a critical and commercial phenomenon worldwide. Now, the Grammy Award-winning album has inspired a Broadway musical.",
    "story": [
      "Remember \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the album?\u00a0 Even if you don't, now there's \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the musical, an exuberant blast from the past \u2013 old Cuban music for a new audience. The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

    "summary": "Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa were found dead in their home last week in a gated community in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He received two Oscars, but more importantly, he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman at the awards ceremony. \"Gene always said, 'I don't think about legacy. I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work.' So I think I speak for us all when I say, Gene, you'll be remembered for that and for so much more.\"",

      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death.",
      "Here's what we know from officials.",
      "How did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said. She had an email conversation with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home, he said.",
      "Based on that information, Jarrell said it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "As of March 7, investigators were awaiting autopsy results for Zinna. Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "There was no known communication from Arakawa indicating she was feeling ill, Mendoza said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",

      "Measles outbreaks across North America are threatening the region's status of having officially eliminated the virus, officials from the Pan-American Health Organization warned, potentially undoing a hard-fought victory to wipe out community transmission.",
      "The U.N. agency pointed to a 4.5-times increase in reported measles cases this year across North and South America, compared to the same period last year.",
      "More than 97% of cases across the region so far this year have been in the U.S. or Canada. Cases have also been reported in Mexico and Argentina.",
      "\"The risk of outbreaks has increased, given the increase in measles cases worldwide, coupled with factors such as low coverage of the first and second doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,\" PAHO, the World Health Organization's regional office for the Americas, said in a report published last week.",
      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",
      "CDC officials warned in 2019 that the country was at risk of losing measles elimination status, after outbreaks spread for several months around undervaccinated communities in the New York area. However, the U.S. ultimately kept its status.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:37:53 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google, Apple and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. \"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",

      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",
      "Currently, only about 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed to cut rates at its March 19 meeting. About half of those polled are forecasting a rate cut at the Fed's subsequent meeting, scheduled for May 7.",

    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-tariffs-should-you-buy-a-car-now-2025-prices/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",

      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",

      "The tariffs are likely to drive up prices on a range of consumer goods, including laptops and tablets, video game consoles and smartphones, according to an analysis from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).",

    "summary": "Utah has become the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "Businesses large and small are bracing for the impact of the Trump administration's new tariffs on U.S. imports from\u00a0Mexico, Canada and China\u00a0\u2014 and preparing to pass on the pain to consumers.",
      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said this week that the electronics retailer is particularly exposed to the tariffs, noting that China and Mexico are the two largest suppliers of the company's products.",
      "\"[W]e expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,\" Barry said in a March 4 call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the company's latest financial results.",
      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",
      "And Target CEO Brian Cornell this week told CNBC that because the discount retailer relies heavily on produce from Mexico, consumers can expect to see higher prices on fruits and vegetables almost immediately.",
      "\"If there's a 25% tariff, those prices will go up,\" Cornell said.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0this week urged the Trump administration to reconsider the sweeping new tariffs, saying they force businesses to choose between hiking prices or risk going out of business.",
      "\"American families and businesses are struggling with high costs. It's one of the top issues that they want policymakers to address,\" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.",
      "\"We also want to work together to keep costs down, but tariffs will only raise prices and increase the economic pain being felt by everyday Americans across the country. We urge reconsideration of this policy and a swift end to these tariffs,\" he added.",
      "Franco Salerno, who owns Darianna Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington, Pennsylvania, told the Chamber of Commerce the company is printing new price tags to reflect the increased costs dress designers expect to incur and pass along to Darianna's, due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Dress designers are already notifying us that they are raising prices to cover any tariffs,\" Salerno told the trade group.",
      "The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade organization representing retailers, also called on President Trump to reconsider his tariff policy.",
      "\"The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hanson, RILA's senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. \"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy. Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.\"",
      "Other businesses are also scrambling to budget for the impact of tariffs. David Spatafore, who owns several restaurants in San Diego, said soaring egg and dairy prices of late has taken a toll. Tuesday's tariffs are adding to the pain.",

    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",

Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "A Canadian official confirmed to CBS News that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Canadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly intened to speak on Wednesday.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",
      "The Mexican peso slumped against the U.S. dollar as Sheinbaum delivered her remarks on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.",

      "More than 1.1 million people with public pensions \u2014 teachers, firefighters, police officers and the like \u2014 have recently received retroactive benefits due to the Social Security Fairness Act, the Social Security Administration said on Tuesday.",
      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",
      "The monthly benefit adjustment and retroactive payments are due to a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, the benefits hike is retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",

      "About 1.13 million people have received a combined $7.5 billion in retroactive payments through March 4, it added.",

      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management in a note yesterday. The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy.

The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa. We're joined now by Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman. Ambassador, it's good to have you here.",
      "CANADIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the Homeland Security Secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow through on fentanyl. Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I hope so. I mean, I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources, we have given our law enforcement new powers and we have responded to the requests of the Trump Administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China. We've had some really, really good discussions, so we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States. So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal, or just because President Trump believes in them?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are- we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border. There are other tariffs that have been discussed and the President has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:",
      "SOT DONALD TRUMP: Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. 250 percent, nobody ever talks about that. 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the Commerce Secretary said, no, that's actually on hold till April 2. It's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?",
      "HILLMAN: You know we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick, and those discussions are heading towards April 2, and that, I think, is we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question. The President- the President does have a variety of concerns, and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives, but really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues. Like, for example, lumber, Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free. On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So what's more, I think productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.",
      "HILLMAN: That's right, and it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same in sugar and dairy. You allow a certain amount of product in, and then after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and you know, small family farms that- that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the Vice President, the Commerce Secretary and President Trump, with your Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Afterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious. Like, quote, \"what's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\" Do you think this is like a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?",
      "HILLMAN: It's hard for me to- hard for me to say. I think that the prime minister and the president- Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.",
      "HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000- practically 6,000 mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion. So it's a long relationship, and has many- has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's Prime Minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?",
      "HILLMAN: You know, I guess\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?",
      "HILLMAN: I- I'm not sure what that is. What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors. You know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in LA, but obviously 9/11. You've come to our aid over the years so many times, and we feel- Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack, and that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and- and healthy and productive relationship with the present. I am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that on our side, that's going to be a priority.",

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones. For more now we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings, and during the first Trump administration, she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council. Good to have you back.",
      "FIONA HILL: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S. provided weapons like HIMARS, we also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine. What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the UK, have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So even if there is some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact. And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the UK, Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence?",
      "HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it'll be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this, because if you're bundling together intelligence, and then effectively, the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our Five Eyes allies, for example, or with other allies? Particularly in the midst of, basically, a conflict that is, as we've heard over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard, because it's not just affecting Ukraine. Again, it's having knock on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",

      "DONALD TRUMP: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's- I think he wants to get it stopped and settled. And I think he's hitting them harder than- than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yeah, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk. I mean, I think if that's what you can take away from this. He actively- that's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president when he says things.",
      "HILL: I think you should, yeah. I mean, he is the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the oval office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards, was the line he kept using then.",
      "HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine. He said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You got their attention.\" It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office, in front of all the cameras, to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals, and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message. And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should only be speaking in your native language. And I think that there was- a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that, I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points, but there was one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your- your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden, and President Trump immediately dismissed all of that. And basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, all the commitments that were made--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not me.",
      "HILL: --because they were weak and it wasn't me. And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this, because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, and what he learned there, was, that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment, and that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand. And I think in future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them, because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates, although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side, on the United States' side, could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy. So my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters. That's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right. Your own government's interpreters, not- because you actually asked that question, whose interpreter we used, and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent and umbrella. That's- does that mean the Transatlantic Alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of, a kind of a one sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States. I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock. And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons. And we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "HILL: That's correct.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We begin this morning with the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Madam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KRISTI NOEM: Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to dive right into this trade war. The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75% in the past six months. Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "10:32:23",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office. And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking, can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels. You've seen the President name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada, just recently, is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "10:33:16",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here. He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Yeah we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is the data accurate?",
      "10:33:36",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 The data is getting better. And I would say in the conversations that I've had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action. So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system so that we know when someone crosses that northern border who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with. We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens. President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction, but boy, every day people in this country are dying of overdoses, and I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be- if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "10:34:43",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do, presumably, to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2. The Commerce Secretary said on another network, if fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, meaning the president, they will stay on until he's comfortable. Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs.",
      "10:35:11",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 I've had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do so they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them. If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business, and he meant it when he ran to be President of the United States again, and since he's taken office, that he will put America first. And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years, violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "10:36:01",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal. This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "10:36:12",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 It really is about fentanyl. It really is. And I think the President obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation. I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing. They are bringing this in, not just to make money, they're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "10:36:47",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you, border crossings, they're at a 25 year low.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 US military personnel working at the border now, that number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month. How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "10:37:02",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense, but also we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the Attorney General's office, you know, we're working every day with the Secretary of State. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters. Our border patrol is doing fantastic work, but we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country where we have a border, where we have laws and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore. Americans have to live by the law, so do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "10:37:49",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to, excuse me, migration. The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children in ICE detention centers. Bush did it, Obama did it, Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "10:38:10",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained. But remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a website where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't really have a choice in this--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They- if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family. And we need to remember that when Americans break the law and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families, too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "10:38:59",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border--",
      "10:39:04",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: --President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: He didn't follow the law in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders. And so today, we're- we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan, they have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan, that was going to be another expansion of this team. They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law, and if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.",
      "10:39:58",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want the number of deportations to tick up?",
      "10:40:01",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: I do. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: People- remember, they have an option to go home on their own. We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.",
      "10:40:25",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?",
      "10:40:33",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: \u00a0There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities. But also we need to remember to ask- Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a CR discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that- that we have. And even- everywhere I've been in this country, out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: in just one month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: 22 known and terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now we have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and--",
      "10:41:23",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "10:41:27",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country. So everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.",
      "10:41:43",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you, you said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them. Back on February 9, you tweeted, the FBI is so corrupt, we will work with any and every agency to stop leaks. Were you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?",
      "10:41:59",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 No, I think there's leakers all over- throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: --I think these, in DHS, specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and expose law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger. So they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of- of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.",
      "10:42:38",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 and you're going to continue these polygraphing",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: Absolutely",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: of employees.",
      "10:42:42",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive, and I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again,",

But Democrats, who have stepped in to help keep the lights on several times in recent years, aren't eager to come to the GOP's aid this time around. Instead, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been looking to secure the support of a number of consistent Republican holdouts \u2014 a group of hardliners who oppose stopgap measures to fund the government on principle.",

      "\"That is not acceptable,\" they wrote in a letter to the Democratic caucus on Friday. \"House Democrats would enthusiastically support a bill that protects Social Security, Medicare, veterans health and Medicaid, but Republicans have chosen to put them on the chopping block to pay for billionaire tax cuts. We cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk. Medicaid is our redline.\"",

Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, called the measure in a statement Saturday a \"slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending.\" She urged lawmakers to pass a shorter-term continuing resolution and finish work on new funding bills, instead of \"turning the keys over to the Trump administration with this bill.\"",

      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",

      "The move by the Trump administration reverses a policy change by the Biden administration, which discontinued the long-term detention of migrant families. It's a practice that was first implemented on a large-scale by the Obama administration, in an attempt to discourage families from crossing the southern border illegally.",

      "The U.S. government has long faced legal, humanitarian and operational challenges when processing migrant parents and children who are in the country without legal permission. In 2015, for example, a federal judge ruled that the government should generally not hold migrant children for longer than 20 days, dramatically limiting family detention in the immigration context.",
      "The revival of family detention is the latest step taken by the Trump administration to expand ICE's capabilities to arrest, detain and deport migrants who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Officials at ICE have been under tremendous pressure from top Trump administration officials to ramp up arrests and deportations.",
      "Unlike its efforts to seal off the U.S.-Mexico border, which have yielded a 25-year low in illegal crossings, the Trump administration's immigration enforcement campaign in the interior of the country has run into operational obstacles.",

      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "Sunland Park, New Mexico \u2014 On a recent afternoon, CBS News accompanied U.S. Border Patrol agent Claudio Herrera along this rugged stretch of the U.S. southern border.",
      "Herrera said the area, located within Border Patrol's sprawling El Paso sector, has long been a hotspot for the illicit movement of people and drugs. But the situation there has changed markedly in recent weeks.",
      "\"The activity is very slow,\" Herrera said along the New Mexico border, which is patrolled by El Paso sector agents. \"There's multiple factors attached to why we have seen a significant drop in apprehensions recently.\"",
      "He continued: \"One of them, of course, is consequences,\" referring to deportations of those entering the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "President Trump has moved aggressively to carry out the large-scale crackdown on illegal immigration he promised on the campaign trail. Since his inauguration, illegal border crossings, which were on the decline during the last year of the Biden administration, have plunged even further.",
      "In February, Border Patrol recorded roughly 8,500 apprehensions of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the lowest level in at least 25 years, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "Asked if the dramatic change stems from new policies out of Washington, D.C., Herrera said, \"It has a lot to do with that.\"",
      "Citing muscular presidential powers, Mr. Trump has effectively shut down the American asylum system, allowing U.S. border agents to swiftly expel migrants under the legal premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\" He has also deployed thousands of additional troops to the U.S. southern border and tasked the military with carrying out deportations.",
      "During that recent ride-along with Border Patrol in the El Paso sector, CBS News cameras captured a heavily fortified U.S. border, spotting Border Patrol agents, soldiers, vehicles and barriers. But there were no migrants in sight.",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown was also on full display when CBS News traveled to the other side of the border.",
      "At a shelter in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Eduardo Medina and his wife Joanna Cortes described how they had brought their three children to northern Mexico last year after fleeing the high levels of crime and violence in the southern state of Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "The young family said they had been staying in a small room for six months, hoping to get an appointment to enter the U.S. with the government's permission. But the app the Biden administration set up to distribute entry appointments to migrants in Mexico, known as CBP One, was quickly terminated after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "While her dream involved opening a restaurant in the U.S. and enrolling her children in American schools, Cortes said her family is thinking of \"returning to the land where we were born\" due to the suspension of the CBP One system.",
      "\"What else are we going to do?\" she said in Spanish, adding later that she did not want her family to cross into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Still, returning to Michoac\u00e1n is a devastating prospect for Cortes.",
      "Breaking down in tears, Cortes said she and her husband \"sold everything\" to ensure their children could have a \"different life\" away from the \"hell\" in Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "But that dream, she said, has \"ended.\"",
      "Asked what he would tell families like the ones interviewed by CBS News in Mexico, Walter Slosar, the top Border Patrol official in the El Paso sector, said U.S. immigration laws must be enforced.",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we're securing the border, and we're going to do so unapologetically,\" Slosar said. \"I understand that people ended up in these areas, but we did not bring those individuals to this specific area.\"",

    "summary": "Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. \"not going to defend\" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",
      "In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were \"loyal and faithful allies,\" and that France had \"respect and friendship\" for the United States.",
      "\"I think we're entitled to expect the same,\" Macron said",
      "Vance irks U.K. and France with remark he claims wasn't aimed at them",

      "Vance said the potential economic deal, which the White House has pushed Kyiv hard to sign, \"is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\"",
      "Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. \u2014 the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "While Vance later appeared to walk his remarks back on social media, saying that both countries had, \"fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years\" and that he did not \"even mention the UK or France\" in the interview, the diplomatic damage was done.",

Politico first reported the timing on Harris' self-imposed deadline to decide whether to run. Candidates have until early March 2026 to file paperwork ahead of the June 2, 2026, primary.",
      "Another source familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News that she is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor. A gubernatorial bid would likely mean she would not run for president in 2028, which she is also considering.",
      "The field to replace Newsom, who has been governor since 2019, is expected to be sizable, but Harris' entry into the race could dissuade other Democrats from launching bids of their own.",
      "A former Harris adviser said \"she'd be great,\" and has already proven she could lead at the national level and as California attorney general.",

      "Harris, 60, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since her November loss to President Trump.

      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort\u00a0to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",

    "summary": "War heroes and historic military events are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the PentAgon works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, the AP reports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.",
      "One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public, said the purge could delete as many as 100,000 images or posts in total, when considering social media pages and other websites that are also being culled for DEI content. The official said it's not clear if the database has been finalized.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Trump's executive order ending those programs across the federal government.",
      "",
      "The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months - such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.",
      "But a review of the database also underscores the confusion that has swirled among agencies about what to remove following Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word \"gay,\" including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.",
      "Several photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish - including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.",
      "In addition, some photos of the Tuskegee Airmen, the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit, were listed on the database, but those may be protected due to historical content.",
      "The Air Force briefly removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen soon after the president's order. That drew the White House's ire over \"malicious compliance,\" and the Air Force quickly reversed the removal.",
      "Many of the images listed in the database already have been removed. Others were still visible Thursday, and it's not clear if they will be taken down at some point or be allowed to stay, including images with historical significance such as those of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Asked about the database, Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement, \"We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.\"",
      "He noted that Hegseth has declared that \"DEI is dead\" and that efforts to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs erodes camaraderie and threatens mission execution.",
      "In some cases, the removal was partial. The main page in a post titled \"Women's History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters\" was removed. But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled \"Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month\" was deleted.",
      "Other photos flagged in the database but still visible Thursday included images of the World War II Women Air Service Pilots and one of U.S. Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt, the country's first female fighter pilot.",
      "Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps' Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.",
      "It was unclear why some other images were removed, such as a Marine Corps photo titled \"Deadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound\" or a National Guard website image called \"Minnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.\"",
      "The database of the 26,000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws, so if the services are queried in the future, they can show how they are complying with the law, the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.",
      "In many cases, workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal, but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made, according to another official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.",
      "A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database \"either has been taken down or will be taken down.\" The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible, but as with the rest of the military, very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal, the official said.",
      "In the Marine Corps, just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10,000 images for removal - and that does not count more than 1,600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.",
      "Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.",
      "The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.",
      "On Feb. 26, the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings, photos, news articles and videos to remove any mentions that \"promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\"",
      "If they couldn't do that by Wednesday, they were told to \"temporarily remove from public display\" all content published during the Biden administration's four years in office.",

    "story": [
      "Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.",
      "The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.",
      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",
      "Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.",
      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",
      "As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.",
      "\"There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,\" Califf testified.",
      "Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.",
      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says he's suspending security clearances of lawyers at Perkins Coie, which was involved in launching oppo research during the 2016 campaign into any ties between Trump and Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and his administration to target a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and, most recently, private-practice attorneys.",
      "\"This is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\" Mr. Trump said as he prepared to sign the executive order in the Oval Office.",
      "The order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \"take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" It does not specify how many lawyers at the law firm would be subject to losing their clearances.",
      "It also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by attorneys at the firm \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the firm said, \"We have reviewed the Executive Order. It is patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.\"",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump's potential ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated among journalists and government officials in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with special counsel John Durham's 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele's findings were unable to verify a \"single substantive allegation.\" Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump before he took office on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \"phony\" and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the investigation began weeks before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did identify a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf, as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump. It also said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The Perkins Coie executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department's civil rights division to \"investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\" DEI \"preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\"",

    "title": "Athena moon lander ended up on its side, bringing mission to an early end",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/athena-moon-lander-tips-over-intuitive-machines-mission/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "title": "22% of butterflies in U.S. disappeared in 2 decades, study finds",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/butterfly-populations-declining-us-science-study/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",

      "Amanda Nguyen, who transformed personal trauma into landmark legislation for sexual assault survivors, now has her sights set on making history among the stars as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space.",
      "Appearing on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday, Nguyen said she is not afraid about her upcoming Blue Origin flight.",
      "\"I really think back to my family and how they were refugees in Vietnam. If they could go through that journey, I can go through this, too,\" she said.",
      "Nguyen will join a historic all-female crew that includes \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, pop star Katy Perry, philanthropist Lauren Sanchez, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and producer Kerrianne Flynn. During the mission, Nguyen plans to conduct two science experiments \u2014 one in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and another focused on women's health.",
      "\"Women were barred from becoming astronauts at NASA early on because of menstruation. They didn't have the data to back that up,\" Nguyen explained.",
      "She is also celebrating the launch of her newly released memoir \"Saving Five,\" which is written from the perspective of different ages of herself, addressing her 5-year-old, 22-year-old, 30-year-old selves and beyond.",
      "\"I picked 5-year-old and 80-year-old because really I think the purpose in our lives is to live out our full potential and to make ourselves proud,\" Nguyen said. \"Truly what I want people to know is that their dreams matter and can still come true.\"",
      "Nguyen discussed how she put her dreams on hold after experiencing sexual assault, choosing to pursue justice rather than her career. She subsequently drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, which was passed unanimously by chambers of Congress.",
      "The legislation she championed extended the preservation period for rape kits, which were previously destroyed after just six months in Massachusetts and 30 days in New York.",
      "\"After ten years of fighting for my rights, I finally get to honor the person that I was before I was hurt,\" Nguyen said.",

      "Recently, NASA was tracking a large asteroid flying past Earth known as the so-called \"city killer.\"",
      "\"This one got a lot of attention because it rose to a threat level that we just have not seen very often. We knew we had to monitor it and try to understand everything we could about it, not just where it is, but what is it made of? What size is it?\" astronomer Nick Moskovitz said.",
      "Moskovitz says he's become an \"asteroid detective,\" working to protect Earth from a possible disaster.",
      "\"Find them before they find you. The sooner you find them, the more options you have for deflecting potentially hazardous asteroids,\" Moskovitz said.",
      "In 2022, NASA performed a first-of-its-kind test. The agency intentionally crashed a spacecraft into a small asteroid, nudging it just enough to change its trajectory. The mission gave the space agency a tool that could potentially be used to counter an asteroid heading for our planet.",
      "\"It's the only natural disaster that we could potentially prevent,\" said NASA's acting planetary defense officer Kelly Fast. \"And if you were to find an impact threat to Earth well enough in advance, then you wouldn't have to deflect it much for it to be able to miss the Earth in the future.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 09:20:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",
      "Once on board, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help their replacements settle in before undocking and returning to Earth around March 19.",

    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google, Apple and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",

      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",

      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: In my stories, I got used to calling Spilotro by his street name \u2013 Tony the Ant. He hated that and it sometimes left me at the receiving end of Spilotro's nasty stares and his menacing fits of anger.",
      "Mark Fierro: The irony of all of this is \u2014 is that Jeff \u2026 was not a tall man, was not a strong man, but he toughed it out and he went toe to toe with these guys year in and year out. And some of these guys were dangerous guys.",
      "Try as they did, they couldn't scare him, says Erickson.",
      "Briana Erickson: After his tires had been slashed and some spooky things were happening to him, he told a mob affiliate in a bar to call off his dogs. Then he got punched in the face. He later described that as a badge of honor.",
      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: A couple of hours later with four stitches under my lip, I had a war story to tell.",
      "As the mob slowly lost its grip on Vegas, German built a career exposing dirty business, government corruption and crime. Prast, the former assistant managing editor for investigations at the Review-Journal, worked with him for three years.",
      "Rhonda Prast: He kept digging and digging and digging, and he was like the dog, the little dog \u2014 that would take a bite of your pants and wouldn't let go. You know, he was just so laser focused on continuing to go deeper and deeper and deeper into a story.",
      "That tenacity helped him expose the truth in stories that could have remained in the shadows. He was one of the few journalists, along with his colleague David Ferrara, to report on the Susan Winters case \u2014 a woman whose parents doubted the suicide ruling in their daughter's death.",
      "Mark Fierro: And Jeff started putting pieces together. \u2026 working with the attorney for the family \u2026 that the way that she killed herself was so unseemly that it just didn't add up. \u2026 And once he started \u2026 he started pulling on that thread, and then he started pulling on a rope and then it turned into a chain.",
      "That chain turned into a series of stories that targeted the husband. Turns out Winters died from ingesting a lethal combination of painkillers and antifreeze. The husband, who was charged with murder, ultimately pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sent to prison.",
      "As hard-charging and public as German was in his work life, the lifelong bachelor was notoriously private about his personal life.",
      "Mark Fierro: He was always back to business, back to business. This man was born to be a reporter.",
      "The entire newsroom rallied together. His colleagues had no idea who did this or why, but they were determined to do what German would have done: find out.",
      "WHO WANTED JEFF GERMAN DEAD?",
      "The Review-Journal staff was in mourning. Their sorrow \u2014 cards and flowers\u2014 in full display on German's desk.",
      "Briana Erickson: It's a reminder that \u2026 this team is not gonna be the same without him \u2026 But we can carry on the way he would want us to.",
      "And that meant doing what he would have done. The staff started tugging on threads and searching for clues, working nonstop on one of the most important stories of their careers: who killed Jeff German?",
      "Rhonda Prast: Immediately, I started thinking in my head, all right, who had threatened Jeff in any way in the last five months? Who could have possibly done this?",
      "Executive editor Glenn Cook asked Prast to come up with a short list of people to consider.",
      "Rhonda Prast: One of the names I gave him was Robert Telles.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And who is Robert Telles?",
      "Rhonda Prast: He was a Clark County elected official, in charge of the Public Administrator's Office, which handles estates of people who were deceased.",
      "One of the estate coordinators in Telles' office, Aleisha Goodwin, had reached out to German in March 2022. She had filed a formal complaint with the County Office of Diversity on behalf of herself and some colleagues claiming Telles harassed, bullied, and discriminated against them.",
      "Rita Reid: He was a horrible, a horrible human being \u2026 Monster is the right word.",
      "But Goodwin says, the county did nothing.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: It was always, \"he's an elected official. There's nothing we can do.\"",
      "German agreed to hear what Goodwin and her colleagues, Noraine Pagdanganan, Rita Reid and Jessica Coleman, had to say.",
      "Jessica Coleman: And when he finally talked to us and he let us tell what had happened to us and he said, \"No, I'm going to look into this.\" \u2026 I think that's the only thing that gave us enough energy to keep going.",
      "According to the women, the trouble began almost immediately after Telles took office in January 2019. Reid, a supervisor, was his second in command and a 12-year veteran of the office.",
      "Rita Reid: He came in very abruptly into the office and he slammed his palms down on my desk (slams hands on table) with a \u2014 with a real loud bang.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Like a (slaps hands on table).",
      "Rita Reid: Oh, yes, absolutely. And he leaned forward, and he said, \"we're ripping off the bandage. You no longer supervise anyone, no one reports to you. \u2026 They all report to me.\" And he turned around and he walked out. And I just sat there stunned.",
      "The women say they were ordered not to speak to each other in the office.",
      "Jessica Coleman It felt dangerous to even have a hello, good morning, conversation with coworkers in passing.",
      "If caught, the consequences could be severe, says Goodwin. She remembers getting called into Telles' office after he saw her and two other women talking",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We walked into his office, and he said, \"sit down and shut up. You're not gonna talk. \u2026 I'm gonna talk.\" \u2026 And he just got this look on his face, he sits back, and he pointed at Noraine and said, \"f*** you.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was it like to be in that room ... receiving that?",
      "Noraine Pagdanganan: It was scary \u2026 because \u2026 I \u2026 Did not want to upset him because I knew how he could be.",
      "Despite years of service, all the women say they feared for their jobs. And Coleman,\u00a0 who safeguarded the property of the deceased in a caged room, says she feared for her physical safety. She says Telles would sometimes come in and threaten her.",
      "Jessica Coleman: There was an instance where he got in my face and, you know, he's yelling and I'm sort of backed up against, um, the cage door.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He was trying to physically intimidate you?",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yes, yes. \u2026 He would bring his chairs up really close and \u2014 and demand that you really pay attention and look him in the eye while he told you horrible things.",
      "One of those horrible things, says Coleman, almost did her in. Alone in the cage together, she says, Telles started by saying that he noticed she never talked to anyone in the office, a bizarre comment considering his no-talking rule.",
      "Jessica Coleman: \"If you keep going down this road, you're going to be like our cases and you're just going to die alone, and nobody is going to find you.\" \u2026 and I sat there and cried. Um, and then after that \u2026 it's hard to admit. (Crying) Then I started, um, thinking the best thing I could do would be to sacrifice myself for the girls.",
      "Jessica Coleman: (Crying) And I had actually picked out a place, um, that I was going to hang myself in the hall in view of the door, because he would always come by and \u2014 and make sure I was working. And I thought this will be good. If they have to find me this way, then the county will have to do something.",
      "Mercifully, Coleman realized that was not the solution to the problem.",
      "But they came up with another plan. The women believed Telles was having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate in the office named Roberta. Roberta, they claimed, used that relationship to assume power and privilege beyond her job title.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is there any doubt in your mind that the two of them were having a romantic affair?",
      "Rita Reid: No.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: No.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Absolutely not.",
      "Peter Van Sant: None whatsoever",
      "Jessica Coleman: No because we --",
      "But they needed proof. So they decided to follow them.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We had seen a pattern, short dress day. If they went the same direction, we knew that we needed to go.",
      "It was always to the same place, says Goodwin \u2014 a parking garage in a nearby mall. The alleged lovers would park next to each other.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We started to take pictures and we started to video.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how did you position yourselves where you could get some video?",
      "Rita Reid: Very carefully.",
      "Peter Van Sant: In a car?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Sometimes in a car. Sometimes we would get out of our car. There were \u2014 there were kind of some cutouts and pillars where you could get angles here and there. \u2026 And we just tried to move around and to get the best that we could.",
      "According to the women, the alleged lovers would ultimately end up in the back seat of Roberta's car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Roberta has said that they would sit in the back seat because she wanted to be able to make eye contact with him as they were having \u2014",

      "Peter Van Sant: \u2014 important office discussions.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Yeah.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yes.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: That is what she said.",
      "Peter Van Sant: OK. And your reaction to that?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Well, that last video we got, we had a little better recorder. You can see the \u2014 the shadows. And you can see those heads going together.",
      "Rita Reid: We felt it was so inappropriate.",
      "But this was the shot they believed was the most telling: Roberta leaving the car and smoothing down her dress.",
      "Rita Reid: It was so unbelievable, and it just took a moment to \u2014 to digest that it would \u2014 I mean, at that moment it was like so real.",
      "After seeing the videos, German asked Roberta about them. She responded, \"I have not had an inappropriate relationship with him.\"\u00a0 The Review-Journal published the story.",

      "Peter Van Sant: As this settled in, are you thinking mission accomplished or you thinking what's gonna happen to us next?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Both.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yeah, the terror didn't stop. The terror almost just got worse. It just changed face.",
      "THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS",
      "German's story with its allegations of turmoil, bullying and hostility had a swift and searing effect at the Public Administrator's Office. The county finally sent in an outside consultant, and Robert Telles lost his bid for re-election in the primary, ironically, to his arch enemy: Rita Reid.",
      "But German wasn't through with Telles yet. He wrote three more scathing pieces chronicling the fall of the once up-and-coming young Democrat, and another story was in the works.",
      "But German did not survive to write it.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Jeff German was found stabbed to death outside his home in the Northwest Valley ...",

      "Goodwin's dad, a former Las Vegas police detective who introduced her to German, said what they were all thinking.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: My dad called me first thing in the morning and said that Jeff had been killed and I didn't even get to react before my dad's next word were, \"I know who my first suspect is.\" \u2026 As soon as those words came out of his mouth, I knew immediately too.",
      "Peter Van Sant: That it was Robert?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: That it was Robert.",

      "Art Kane: Yes. We weren't gonna do anything until every little rock was overturned and every little fact was found out about what \u2014 what this guy was and who he was.",
      "Art Kane, now the investigations editor, was a reporter at the time.",
      "Art Kane: And we started finding out a lot of interesting things about him. For example \u2026 He was arrested while he was public administrator \u2026 for choking his wife.",

      "Art Kane: Well, it means that possibly Jeff was killed by the last story he wrote about. I mean, this was his last investigation and \u2014 and the suspect appears to be the guy he wrote about and basically took him out of office.",
      "Without corroboration from police documents, The Review-Journal couldn't go with the story. But Cook was betting it wouldn't be long. His reporters had seen unmarked police cars outside Robert Telles' home.",

While he was in custody, detectives collected a DNA sample from Telles. They also took the jeans he was wearing into evidence and gave him a white paper suit to change into before he was taken back to his house and swarmed by reporters eagerly awaiting his arrival.",
      "Inside Telles' home, investigators say they found gym shoes and a duffel bag similar to what was seen in the surveillance video. And when they looked in the garage, detectives say they discovered even more \u2013 a straw sun hat \u2014 or what was left of it.",

      "Glenn Cook: Prosecutors have mentioned this as a contributing motive to the murder. In Robert Telles' mind \u2026 Jeff German ruined his marriage, ruined his political career, embarrassed him and was continuing to report on him rather than leave him alone.",

Your heart tells you if we wouldn't have made that call, he wouldn't have died in that violent way that day. And if I was to talk to him today, I think the first thing I would say is, \"I'm sorry.\" \u2026 But not for him, for me, because he wouldn't have accepted my apology (crying), but I need to give it.",

      "I've now watched through glass and bars as 11 men were put to death at a South Carolina prison. None of the previous 10 prepared me for watching the\u00a0firing squad death of Brad Sigmon on Friday night.",
      "I might now be unique among U.S. reporters: I've witnessed three different methods - nine lethal injections and an electric chair execution. I can still hear the thunk of the breaker falling 21 years later.",
      "As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject.",
      "In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.",
      "I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend's parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead.",
      "But you don't know everything when some of execution protocols are kept secret, and it's impossible to know what to expect when you've never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you.",
      "The\u00a0firing squad\u00a0is certainly faster - and more violent - than lethal injection. It's a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",
      "That's down from 31 last August. After a 13-year pause while South Carolina struggled to obtain the drugs for lethal injections, the state has resumed executions. Inmates may choose between injections, electrocution or the firing squad.",
      "I witnessed Freddie Owens being put to death Sept. 20. He locked eyes with every witness in the room.",
      "I saw Richard Moore die Nov. 1, looking serenely at the celling as his lawyer, who became close to him while fighting for his life over a decade, wept.",
      "And I was there, too, when Marion Bowman Jr. died Jan. 31, a small smile on his face as he turned to his lawyer, then closed his eyes and waited.",
      "I remember other executions too. I've seen family members of victims stare down a killer on the gurney. I've seen a mother shed tears as she watched her son die, almost close enough to touch if the glass and bars weren't in the way.",
      "Like that thunk of the breaker back in 2004, I won't forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on.",
      "I'll likely be back at Broad River Correctional Institution on April 11. Two more men on death row are out of appeals, and the state Supreme Court appears ready to schedule their deaths at five-week intervals.",
      "They would be the 12th and 13th men I've seen killed by the state of South Carolina. And when it is over, I will have witnessed more than a quarter of the state's executions since the death penalty was reinstated.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll from two days of clashes between Syrian security forces and loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad and revenge killings that followed has risen to more than 1,000, a war monitoring group said Saturday, making it one of the deadliest acts of violence since Syria's conflict began 14 years ago.",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in addition to 745 civilians killed, mostly in shootings from close distance, 125 government security force members and 148 militants with armed groups affiliated with Assad were killed. It added that electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around the city of Latakia.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the killings in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Sunday.",
      "\"The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days. The United States stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,\" Rubio said in the statement, adding, \"Syria's interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria's minority communities accountable.\"",
      "The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power.",
      "The government has said that they were responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed \"individual actions\" for the rampant violence.",
      "The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad's support base for decades.",
      "Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria's coastal region told the AP from their hideouts.",
      "They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety.",
      "Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes.",
      "Sheha called the attacks \"revenge killings\" of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad's government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters, and militants from neighboring villages and towns.",
      "\"It was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,\" as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 12 miles away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes.",
      "The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday.",
      "\"This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\" Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians.",
      "The previous figure given by the group was more than 600 dead. No official figures have been released.",
      "A funeral was held Saturday afternoon for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya after they were killed in the clashes along Syria's coast. Scores of people attended the funeral.",
      "Syria's state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region \"to prevent violations and gradually restore stability.\"",
      "On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. Those killed included nine children and four women, the residents said, sending the AP photos of the bodies draped in white cloth as they were lined in the mass grave.",
      "Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser, who holds one of the two seats allocated to the Alawite sect in parliament, said that people were fleeing from Syria for safety in Lebanon. He said he didn't have exact numbers.",
      "Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad's fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed.",
      "Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the country's new security forces over the past several weeks.",
      "France expressed \"its deep concern\" over recent violence in Syria. Paris \"condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on the basis of religion grounds and against prisoners,\" its foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday.",
      "France urged Syrian interim authorities to make sure independent investigations \"shed full light on these crimes.\"",
      "The most recent clashes started when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh, and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Observatory.",

    "summary": "New guidelines agreed to last year by 21 nations (including the U.S.), and a recent French law, may make it easier for Jewish families to claim ownership of artworks that they believe were sold under duress as the Nazis took over Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Few who see Picasso's \"The Actor \"at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art know its complicated history. Paul Leffmann, a German Jewish businessman, sold it in 1938. \"It used to hang in the home of my great-granduncle,\" said Laura Zuckerman. \"He needed money to escape the Nazis.\"",
      "\"Did they get out?\" I asked.",
      "\"They did get out. And they did survive. But not all of the family did.\"",
      "Zuckerman represents Leffmann's heirs, who have fought for the painting \u2013 worth as much as $100 million \u2013 claiming it was sold under duress, meaning, \"If there had not been Nazi persecution against them, they never would have sold it,\" she said.",
      "Yet, two American courts disagreed.",
      "But for other cases, the tide may be turning. An Amsterdam museum returned \"Odalisque\" by Henri Matisse, to the heirs of Albert and Marie Stern, saying it was sold under duress. The Sterns had tried to escape, but most of the family died in concentration camps.",
      "And in an historic policy shift, the French Parliament recently unanimously approved a law fast-tracking the return of art to families who claim it is rightfully theirs.",
      "David Zivie, of France's culture ministry, heads the mission for research and return of Nazi-era looted property. He says the motive of such work is \"to recognize what happened, and to help families to get their works.",
      "\"We have to know the history, because they should be in the rightful owner's hands, because they are the last witnesses of what happened during the war,\" Zivie said. \"These works are like the witnesses of the persecutions.\"",
      "University of Denver professor of history Elizabeth Campbell said, \"I think there finally is political will to recognize that this is part of belated justice.\"",
      "She wrote about the complicity of the French and other European governments in keeping what the Nazis stole in her book,\u00a0\"Museum Worthy: Nazi Art Plunder in Postwar Western Europe.\"\u00a0Campbell says there could be even more change with new guidelines agreed to by France and other countries, including the United States. \"These new guidelines say that any persecuted person who sold a work of art during the Nazi era should be assumed to have done so under duress,\" she said. \"So, it's now giving a blanket acknowledgement of coercion in any sale. It's really a dramatic change.\"",
      "When the Germans retreated, allied art experts found stacks of stolen paintings everywhere, from caves to castles. More than 60,000 pieces of art were returned to France. But some 2,000 pieces ended up in limbo, held by the French government with no clear rightful owner.",
      "Ines Rotermund-Reynard is the newly-hired provenance researcher at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Her job is to find the truth about a piece of art's Nazi-era past. \"There's really a huge wish now by the French to clarify the situation,\" she said. \"It's somehow as if you take a detective and you say, 'Look at all the cold cases which happened 80 years ago and solve it.' Each story is important. And it is worth, for each family, to do this effort.\"",
      "But the case of Armand Dorville has pitted the French government against his heirs, among them Francine Kahn, who said, \"Discovering those pictures is a way to know him.\"",
      "Another heir, Rapha\u00ebl Falk, said, \"I feel anger when we have so much difficulties to retrieve them.\"",
      "When Dorville died of natural causes in 1941, his art collection was sold at auction. But due to anti-semitic laws, the French authorities confiscated the proceeds, and family members \u2013 without money to escape \u2013 were later murdered at Auschwitz.",
      "Eighty years later, a North Carolina museum returned one of Dorville's paintings to the family, and a German museum returned one by impressionist Camille Pissarro. But the French government is refusing to give back more than half a dozen paintings held in public museums, saying the auction was not done under duress.",
      "Falk said, \"It must be hard for them to give them back. So, I can understand that. But [to give them back], it's just right, you know? It's just right.\"",
      "The family hired Paris lawyer Corinne Herschkovitch, who has spent 30 years recovering art for Jewish families. \"All these people in charge of the cultural heritage, they were more concerned by keeping alive or preserve all these paintings and works of art than to preserve the Jews,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think some of these museum directors are still ashamed of how they got these paintings?\"",
      "\"I think so, I think so. They are embarrassed, that's for sure,\" said Herschkovitch.",
      "The Dorville heirs believe they are fighting for their history.",
      "I asked, \"When you get them back into the family, do you feel somehow that bad history has been corrected? Erased?\"",
      "\"Not erased, never erased,\" Falk replied. \"Members of our family died because of it. In my mind, it's a way to repair the damage that was done.\"",
      "Kahn said, \"It is the memory of the family. Because it was totally forgotten. And it is on our shoulders to awake this story ... to tell the story.\"",

We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain,\" he wrote.",
      "Francis, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained in stable condition at Gemelli, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday.",
      "The doctors said that such stability \"as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\" It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14.

On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter's Square, the giant banner bearing Francis' papal coat of arms fluttered from the loggia of the basilica above. Even while in the hospital, Francis is very much still the pope and in charge of the Catholic Church.",

The Vatican has noted that such meetings are the routine way the pope governs while at the Vatican, making clear that he was getting essential work done from Gemelli.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",

      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\"Once I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \"black holes\" for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\"My hope was freedom. Just freedom,\" he said. \"They didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me 'No, no, no, no, no.'\"",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn't want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with an Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \"we do not accept asylum.\"",
      "\"None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\" said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama's deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",
      "That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities.",
      "Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she'd find a way back to the U.S.",
      "\"I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,\" she said.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also came as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999. Panama's leaders have rejected the idea outright, and disputed claims by Mr. Trump and U.S. officials about China's influence on the canal's operations.",

      "Russian strikes on Ukraine killed at least 20 people, officials said Saturday, as heavy aerial attacks continued after the U.S. stopped sharing satellite images with Ukraine.",
      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine's ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine's Donetsk region late Friday. The attack also damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances.",

      "\"Last night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\" he said. \"After emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers.

      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Trump responded: \"I think he's doing what anybody else would.\"",

      "Meanwhile, food shortages in the territory have become acute and Palestinians living there are again struggling to feed their families.",
      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel's campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire's first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.",
      "But the intended second phase of the deal \u2013 meant to bring the release of the remaining hostages and a lasting truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 has been thrown into doubt. Israel has called for Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in return for an extension of the ceasefire and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",

      "Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The campaign was triggered by Hamas' October 2023 terrorist attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others.",

One in four countries reported a backlash against women's rights last year, according to U.N. data.",
      "Here is what to know about the March 8 global event:",
      "International Women's Day is a global celebration - and a call to action - marked by demonstrations, mostly of women, around the world, ranging from combative protests to charity runs. Some celebrate the economic, social and political achievements of women, while others urge governments to guarantee equal pay, access to health care, justice for victims of gender-based violence and education for girls.",
      "It is an official holiday in more than 20 countries, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ukraine, Russia and Cuba, the only one in the Americas.",
      "As in other aspects of life, social media plays an important role during International Women's Day, particularly by amplifying attention to demonstrations held in countries with repressive governments toward women and dissent in general.",
      "While the idea behind a women's day originated in the U.S. with the American Socialist Party in 1909, it was a German feminist who pushed for a global commemoration during an international conference of socialist women held in 1910 in Copenhagen. The following year, events across Europe marked the day, and during World War I, women used it to protest the armed conflict, which lasted from 1914 to 1918.",
      "International Women's Day is observed on March 8 after a massive protest in Russia on Feb. 23, 1917, that led to the country's eventual withdrawal from the war. At the time, Russia had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and still used the Julian calendar.",
      "\"On Feb. 23 in Russia, which was March 8 in Western Europe, women went out on the streets and protested for bread and peace,\" said Kristen Ghodsee, professor and chair of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The authorities weren't able to stop them, and then, once the men saw that the women were out on the streets, all of the workers started coming and joining the women.\"",
      "The U.N. began commemorating the holiday in 1975, which was International Women's Year, and its General Assembly officially recognized the day two years later.",
      "Women in Eastern Europe have long received flowers on March 8 - and sometimes even gotten the day off from work. But chocolates and candy can come across as belittling gestures, showing a lack of understanding of the struggles driving women to protest, particularly in regions where protests have been combative.",
      "In Turkey, women in 2023 braved an official ban on an International Women's Day march in Istanbul, and protested for about two hours before police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and detain dozens of people.",
      "In Mexico, which hosts one of the region's biggest marches, celebrations this year are marked by sharp contrasts. While the country celebrates its first female president, many also mourn victims of stark violence against women - including femicide. In Mexico and Latin America, soaring rates of violence against women and persistent machismo often leave tension simmering on March 8 as protesters demand justice.",
      "Globally, a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a family member or partner, according to U.N. figures, and women being exposed to conflict has significantly jumped over the past decade.",
      "Ghodsee said commemorating International Women's Day is now more important than ever, as women have lost gains made in the last century, chief among them the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a nationwide right to abortion, which ended constitutional protections that had been in place nearly 50 years."

      "Sexual assaults on women have become familiar in India, where police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. That's an average of about 90 rapes per day, CBS News previously reported, and the real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims' lack of faith in police.",
      "Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the brutal 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus.

    "story": [
      "South Korea's impeached conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was released from prison on Saturday, a day after a Seoul court canceled his arrest to allow him to stand trial for rebellion without being detained.",
      "After walking out of a detention center near Seoul, Yoon waved, clenched his fists and bowed deeply to his supporters who were shouting his name and waving South Korean and U.S. flags. Yoon climbed into a black van headed to his presidential residence in Seoul.",
      "In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he \"appreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul Central District Court to correct illegality,\" in an apparent reference to legal disputes over his arrest. He said he also thanks his supporters and asked those who are on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.",
      "Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into huge political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",
      "The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Friday it accepted Yoon's request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations on the president. Yoon's lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "Yoon's release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is canceled by a court.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon's Dec. 14 impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors' decision, calling them \"henchmen\" of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.",
      "At the heart of public criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree was his dispatch of hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after placing the country under military rule. Some senior military and police officials sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to pull out lawmakers to thwart a parliamentary vote on the decree. Yoon has countered that he aimed to maintain order.",
      "Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted unanimously to overturn Yoon's decree.",
      "Investigators have alleged Yoon's martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that doesn't cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.",
      "Yoon has said he didn't intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\"",
      "South Korea's conservative-liberal divide is severe, and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon's impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes, the division is certain to worsen.",

    "story": [
      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",
      "When CBS News asked staffers about the other tools, they said they were not aware of any and did not know how else to access the information.",

      "\"She appears totally self-consumed and tone deaf,\" Schofield added. \"You're standing next to Mindy Kaling, and you're not asking her how she built her girl boss empire? Why?\"",
      "After rising to fame when she starred in the hit NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" Kaling, 45, founded her production company, Kaling International, in 2012. Through Kaling International, Kaling has created and produced a number of successful television series, including \"The Mindy Project,\" \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"",
      "Kaling is the creator and showrunner of her company's most recent project, Netflix's TV show \"Running Point,\" which stars Kate Hudson. The sports comedy premiered on the streaming platform Feb. 27 and debuted at No. 3 on Netflix's Top 10 Shows in the U.S.",
      "The six-time Emmy Award winner joined Markle in the second episode of \"With Love, Meghan\" during which they teamed up to host a children's garden tea party. According to Markle, the two have been \"email pen pals\" since Kaling appeared on her \"Archetypes\" podcast in 2022.",
      "Shortly after the show's premiere, the episode went viral for a moment when Markle corrected Kaling when the comedian referred to the duchess by her maiden name.",
      "Royal expert Kinsey Schofield suggested Markle should \"elevate\" the guests on the show rather than \"hijacking all the oxygen in the room.\" (Netflix)",
      "\"It\u2019s so funny, too, that you keep saying Meghan Markle,\" Markle said. \"You know I\u2019m Sussex now.\"",
      "Schofield noted how the viral exchange highlighted points that other reviewers made in their criticism of \"With Love, Meghan.\" The show, which Markle chose to film at a rented estate in Montecito, California, instead of her own home nearby, has been critiqued for lacking authenticity.",
      "\"Meghan lacks humility or an ounce of authenticity.\" Schofield said. \"It\u2019s a blatantly obvious PR exercise that does not give us a glimpse of Meghan\u2019s real world. She\u2019s doing random arts and crafts in someone else's house with people she claims are her very best friends but doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re left-handed or allergic to peanut butter? Your \u2018girl\u2019 Mindy doesn\u2019t know your last name is Sussex?",
      "\"It\u2019s such a painful farce,\" Schofield added. \"Her 'hacks' are common knowledge, and her definition of 'elevating' equals wasting 60 pounds of fruit and tracing lines on your paper menu with a pencil so you can erase them later.\"",
      "Markle and Kaling had an awkward exchange on the show that later went viral. (Netflix)",
      "Royal photographer Helena Chard agreed that Markle's show would have had more resonance with audiences if she had used the opportunity to authentically connect with her guests and showcase her real personality.",
      "\"As far as I see, Meghan lacks charisma and connection with her guests and audience,\" Chard told Fox News Digital. \"Her guests, however, glorify Meghan, putting her on a pedestal. It would do Meghan\u2019s character wonders if she changed things up by focusing and lifting her guests for a change.\"",
      "Chard pointed out that audiences in the United Kingdom may not be familiar with some of the guests on \"With Love, Meghan\" and \"to find out more about them would add a special touch.\"",
      "The royal expert described Markle's cooking and hosting tips and tricks as \"unoriginal and basic.\"",
      "\"The production sadly feels bland, staged and stilted,\" Chard added. \"Netflix [has] shot a glossy production focusing on Meghan. The hope is the series will show Meghan in a new light, rehabilitate her image and change public perception.",
      "\"The truth is people want to see more raw fun moments, not staged aspirational content,\" she explained. \"A fun, authentic personality full of heart resonates far more with the public and would give Meghan far more kudos.\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" has been criticized for lacking authenticity. (Netflix)",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" was originally scheduled to be released in January, but its debut was delayed due to the Los Angeles fires. The lifestyle show is the latest project to originate from the multiyear deal Markle and husband Prince Harry made with Netflix in 2020. The streamer announced Friday that \"With Love, Meghan\" will premiere its second season this fall and that the episodes have already been shot.",
      "In December 2024, Netflix released Harry's five-part documentary project, \"Polo,\" which followed professional polo players as they compete in the U.S. Open Polo Championship during the 2024 season. Harry and Meghan made brief appearances in the docuseries when the duke competed in a charity polo match.",
      "\"Polo\" was also met with mostly negative reviews after its release. Royal expert Hilary Fordwich drew comparisons between \"Polo\" and \"With Love, Meghan,\" telling Fox News Digital the shows were poorly received for similar reasons.",
      "The show is the latest project from Markle and Harry's deal with Netflix. (Netflix)",
      "\"Most unfortunately, just like Harry\u2019s Netflix flop \u2018Polo\u2019, amongst the plethora of reasons why ratings are so low and critics have savaged [Markle]\u2019s is due to lack of authenticity, being a tone-deaf portrayal of privileged self-important people,\" Fordwich said.",
      "\"Neither Netflix show has resonated with audiences. Both have been universally derided,\" she added.",
      "Fordwich cited the shows' low ranking scores from users on IMDb, where \"Polo\" holds an audience score of three out of 10 and \"With Love, Meghan\" notched a score of 2.7 out of 10.",
      "\"Both sets of low ratings are devastating as Netflix doesn\u2019t invest to reap such lackluster ratings,\" Fordwich said.",
      "Fordwich referred to an Instagram post Markle shared to promote \"With Love, Meghan\" ahead of its release. On Tuesday, Markle uploaded a carousel of images taken during the show's production, writing \"Today is the day! A few BTS snaps + food pictures I took on set for \u2018With Love, Meghan.\u2019 Come join the party on @netflix!\"",
      "Markle celebrated as the show entered Netflix's Top 10 within 24 hours of its release. (Netflix)",
      "\"It\u2019s not exactly begging, but [Markle] has encouraged fans to \u2018Come join the party,\u2019 perhaps due to the ghastly ratings?\" Fordwich said.",
      "Despite the show's negative reviews, Markle celebrated its streaming success in a post she shared on her Instagram story Wednesday.",
      "\"For more recipes, fun, and reasons to \u2018Mmmm\u2019, check out the show \u2014 which in just 24 hours is already in the Top 10!\" the duchess wrote underneath a promo for \"With Love, Meghan.\"",
      "\"Thank you to all of you around the world who are tuning in!\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" held the No. 6 spot on Netflix's Top 10 Wednesday and climbed to No. 5 by Thursday. However, as of Friday, the show moved to No. 7 on the streaming platform's Top 10.",

      "She continued, \"With each successive visit, he was more at ease, more likable and charming. At one point, he asked me if I\u2019d gone to school for journalism. I told him I had, in New York City. He then, in an offhand way, began asking me about New York politicians.

      "\"My first thought was, 'I'm going to marry that girl,'\" Dean told Entertainment Tonight about meeting Parton for the first time. \"My second thought was, 'Lord, she\u2019s good-looking.' And that was the day my life began. I wouldn't trade the last 50 years for nothing on this Earth.\"",
      "Over the years, Parton provided glimpses into their lives during interviews and has occasionally shared throwback photos of herself with Dean on social media. In 2021, she shared a throwback snap of the two, writing, \"Find you a partner who will support you like my Carl Dean does!\"",

      "5 YEARS AFTER COVID, AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER IT'S STILL A THREAT",
      "He was discharged in July 2020 with an oxygen tank. Despite overcoming the initial infection, Thomas\u2019 condition deteriorated.",
      "In 2022, the pastor noticed that his daily activity tolerance diminished dramatically and he required more oxygen for simple tasks.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"I couldn't take a shower for more than 30 seconds without being on oxygen,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "Scheinin said the pastor had no underlying conditions before contracting COVID. A lung biopsy showed that Thomas\u2019 symptoms were consistent with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to the COVID-19 infection.",

      "Thomas\u2019 story was remarkable in that he survived the first bout with COVID, but two years later, his lungs had deteriorated so badly from the scarring that he needed a double lung transplant, Scheinin shared.",
      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",
      "Now, two years after his lung transplant, Thomas says he no longer needs oxygen supplementation and is back to performing his daily pastoral activities at his church in Queens Village, New York, albeit at a slower pace than before.",
      "The pastor has returned to long-distance driving and can now walk for about 30 minutes. He attributes his successful recovery to the efforts of his Mount Sinai medical team, his faith and prayers from his congregation.",
      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",
      "Symptoms of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis can mimic other types of interstitial lung diseases, which are disorders that\u00a0cause progressive scarring and inflammation of lung tissue.",
      "If a person who previously had a COVID infection continues to experience shortness of breath, chronic cough and change in their exercise tolerance \u2014 or if they smoke or have an underlying condition such as emphysema \u2014 they should see their physician or a pulmonologist, according to Scheinin.",

      "It includes an additional $8 billion in defense dollars in an apparent bid to ease national security hawks' concerns, while non-defense spending that Congress annually appropriates would decrease by about $13 billion.",
      "There's also an added $6 billion for healthcare for veterans.",
      "The White House has requested additional spending in areas that were not present in the last government funding extension, known as \"anomalies.\"",
      "Among the anomalies requested by Trump and being fulfilled by the bill is added funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "Aides said the funding is meant to meet \"an operations shortfall that goes back to the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"That money, most of that, has already been obligated prior to the start of this administration. So that request reflects an existing hole,\" a source said.",
      "The bill also ensures that spending caps placed under a prior bipartisan agreement, the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), are followed. The FRA mandated no more than a 1% federal spending increase in FY 2025.",
      "Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending would be found by eliminating some \"side deals\" made during FRA negotiations, House GOP leadership aides said. Lawmakers would also not be given an opportunity to request funding for special pet projects in their districts known as earmarks, another area that Republicans are classifying as savings.",
      "Overall, it provides for $892.5 billion in discretionary federal defense spending, and $708 billion in non-defense discretionary spending.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune will have to take up the bill after it passes the House (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",
      "\"Discretionary spending\" refers to dollars allocated by Congress on an annual basis, rather than mandatory spending obligations like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.",
      "The bill is what's known as a continuing resolution (CR), which differs from Congress' annual appropriations bills in that it just extends the previous fiscal year's government funding levels and priorities.",
      "It would be the third and final CR extending FY 2024 numbers, through the remainder of FY 2025. Republicans believe it will put them in the best possible position to negotiate conservative government funding priorities in time for Oct. 1.",
      "The previous two extensions were passed under the Biden administration, when Democrats controlled the Senate.",
      "And while some Democratic support is needed to reach the Senate's 60-vote threshold, it's very possible Republicans will have to carry it through the House alone with their razor-thin majority.",
      "DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY REBUKE PARTY MEMBERS WHO JEERED TRUMP DURING SPEECH TO CONGRESS: REPORT",
      "House Democrats traditionally vote to avoid government shutdowns. Now, however, Democratic leaders are directing lawmakers in the lower chamber to oppose the Republican CR.",
      "In a joint letter to colleagues sent on Friday, House Democratic leaders accused Republicans of trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid through their CR \u2013 despite it being the wrong mechanism to alter such funds.",
      "\"Republicans have decided to introduce a partisan continuing resolution that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year,\" the statement said. \"House Democrats would enthusiastically support a bill that protects Social Security, Medicare, veterans health and Medicaid, but Republicans have chosen to put them on the chopping block to pay for billionaire tax cuts.\"",
      "But House GOP leaders will need to work to convince nearly all Republican lawmakers to support the bill \u2013 despite a history of dozens of conservative defections on CRs over the last two years.",
      "At least one Republican has already signaled he will oppose it. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, who has voted against CRs previously, wrote on X last week, \"I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget! CR\u2019s are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.\"",

      "GOP leaders are hoping their close coordination with the White House and a blessing from Trump, however, will be enough to sway remaining holdouts.",
      "While he has not weighed in on the specific bill, Trump posted on Truth Social this week, \"I am working with the GREAT House Republicans on a Continuing Resolution to fund the Government until September to give us some needed time to work on our Agenda.\"",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year,\" Trump wrote.",

      "Domenico, a Trump appointee and Colorado\u2019s former solicitor general, said that it wasn\u2019t clear how much of the fear surrounding possible enforcement actions in schools was really due to the new rules as opposed to broader concerns of increased immigration actions.",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention. Your vigilance not only protected you but also helps educate others. Together, we can stay one step ahead of scammers and protect our finances.",

Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser \u2014 don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",
      "Using your digital ID with Apple Wallet from your iPhone or Apple Watch works similarly to Apple Pay. You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share. Next, you'll double-tap the side button to approve it, as if you were paying with Apple Pay.",

      "With digital IDs, only the information needed and nothing more can be transferred easily. For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

      "If you are unable to add your driver's license to your Apple ID, it's most likely because your state doesn't yet support the feature. If your state is on the list above, but you can't add your license, it may be because of a temporary Apple server outage.\u00a0Apple recommends that you contact the local DMV or state office that issued your card in the event that the servers are not down.",

      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

      "Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target.

If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "7. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities. By understanding their methods and taking preventative steps, we can make it harder for them to succeed.",

      "Companies that handle massive amounts of user data are often the least careful with it. Last year, the National Public Data breach\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond. Now, another breach has surfaced, this time affecting DISA Global Solutions, an employee screening provider.",

      "DISA Global Solutions, a company specializing in employee screening services, recently\u00a0disclosed a major data breach affecting over 3.3 million individuals. The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

According to filings with the attorneys general of Maine and\u00a0Massachusetts, the compromised information included Social Security numbers, financial account details (such as credit card numbers), driver\u2019s licenses and other government-issued identification documents.",
      "Given DISA\u2019s role in employee screening, the breach likely exposed data collected from background checks and drug tests, potentially including employment histories, criminal records and even health-related information. The notification to affected individuals \u2013 more than 360,000 were Massachusetts residents and 15,198 from Maine \u2013 underscored the breadth of the incident, affecting a staggering 3,332,750 people nationwide.",

      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about how lab-grown muscles power a biohybrid hand for scalable prosthetics and research.",
      "A groundbreaking development has come from researchers at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University in Japan. They've created a biohybrid hand, a fusion of lab-grown muscle tissue and mechanical engineering, capable of gripping and making gestures. This innovation paves the way for a new generation of robotics with diverse applications.",

      "Biohybrid hand (Science Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Bridging biology and robotics",
      "While soft robots and advanced prosthetics are becoming increasingly common, the combination of living tissue and machines is still relatively rare. The field of biohybrid science is in its infancy, with only a few examples, such as artificial fish powered by human heart cells or robots using locust ears for hearing. This new biohybrid hand represents a significant step forward in the practical application of this technology.",

      "SOFT ROBOTIC ARMBAND GIVES PROSTHETIC HAND USERS NATURAL CONTROL",
      "The secret ingredient: MuMuTAs",
      "So, how did they do it? The team started by growing muscle fibers in the lab. Recognizing that these delicate tissues wouldn't be strong enough on their own, they bundled them into what they call \"multiple tissue actuators,\" or MuMuTAs. \"Our key achievement was developing the MuMuTAs,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from the University of Tokyo.",
      "Takeuchi is the co-author of a study describing the creation that was published in the journal\u00a0Science Robotics. Shoji explained that creating MuMuTAs was their key achievement. By rolling the thin strands of muscle tissue like a sushi roll, they ensured enough contractile force and length to drive the hand's movements.",

      "Like a real hand",
      "One of the most remarkable findings was that the biohybrid hand experienced fatigue, just like a real human hand. After 10 minutes of use, the force of the tissue declined, but it recovered within an hour of rest. This observation highlights the lifelike properties of the engineered muscle tissue.",
      "Biohybrid hand (Science Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and future directions",
      "Takeuchi and his team acknowledge that their creation is currently a proof of concept. During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

While the field of biohybrid robotics is still young, this technology has the potential to revolutionize advanced prosthetics. It could also serve as a valuable tool for understanding muscle tissue function, testing surgical procedures and developing drugs that target muscle tissue.",

      "The use of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) to solve violent crimes has overwhelming public support, she said, but privacy concerns are still an issue in cases like University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger's, where the FBI accessed two databases that purport to exclude law enforcement from their services. As a result, unwitting users could be submitting clues that lead detectives to their own relatives without knowing it.",
      "Transcripts unsealed of a closed-door hearing on the defense's attempt to have DNA evidence thrown out of court revealed that the FBI violated a Department of Justice interim policy and the terms of service of the two private databases agents turned to after the smaller ones, FamilyTreeDNA and GEDmatch PRO, didn't pan out.",

      "The FBI declined to comment and instead pointed to Judge Steven Hippler's Feb. 17 order, in which he wrote that investigators had not violated Kohberger's constitutional rights or broken any laws when they uploaded samples to MyHeritage and GEDMatch (without the \"PRO\").",
      "\"This is not the first case where this has been brought up,\" Moore told Fox News Digital. \"It's not the first case where a judge has weighed in on this question and made a similar ruling, because legality and companies' own terms of service are not the same thing \u2013 and so that is how the FBI is able to legally use that non-consented database.\"",

      "Boise attorney Edwina Elcox breaks down new evidence in the Idaho student murders case: The only known eyewitness had artwork in her bedroom that the defense argues may have improperly led her to claim that the intruder had 'bushy eyebrows.'",
      "Bryan Kohberger's defense team is asking the judge overseeing his quadruple murder trial to block an eyewitness from testifying about the intruder she saw having \"bushy eyebrows\" on the night three of her housemates and another friend were killed in a 4 a.m. massacre.",
      "First, the defense argues that allowing the witness, identified in court filings as \"DM,\" would be unfair, too vague and unfairly prejudicial before the jury. Also in the motion, attorney Elisa Massoth denies that the defendant, Kohberger, has bushy eyebrows.",
      "She is also seeking an order barring any evidence related to \"bushy eyebrows\" in addition to keeping DM from using the phrase. In separate filings, the defense is also asking the court to limit the use of the words murder, psychopath and sociopath.",
      "The surviving housemate is the only known witness to have encountered the intruder and lived to tell her tale after she froze in shock, and he walked toward a back sliding door \u2013 and recently unsealed text messages so she tried in vain to reach her murdered friends minutes after the intruder left.",

      "The motion became public after Judge Steven Hippler told defense attorneys and prosecutors they were keeping too many court filings out of public view, filing them under seal without proper justification.",
      "Massoth wrote that DM was unable to describe the masked intruder to a sketch artist and did not know what color eyebrows the intruder had. The texts, at least the exceprts that have been made public, show she discussed the intruder's mask covering his mouth and forehead. They do not mention his eyebrows.",
      "\"Eyewitness identifications are inherently unreliable,\" said Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based defense attorney who formerly represented Lori Vallow. \"Especially this one \u2013 it's beyond vague.\"",

      "But what stands out to her in this case is the revelation in court filings that DM had a wall of photos and artwork, some of which she had drawn herself, depicting detailed faces and prominent eyebrows.",
      "Last month, defense attorneys tried to attack the housemate's credibility, arguing her story changed in the span of three interviews with investigators and that she admitted she had been drinking, felt tired and her memory was hazy.",
      "\"There is a beyond strong explanation, when somebody is so unsure about why they may have this distinctive impression of eyebrows \u2013 \u00a0because it's all over the room,\" Elcox told Fox News Digital. \"It's artwork that they're drawing.\"",
      "Read the motion",
      "The defense argued that this artwork could have influenced her memory.",
      "\"There is no reliability of the physical characteristics that D.M. has reported,\" Massoth wrote. \"Mr. Kohberger does not have bushy eyebrows, but the art work on D.M.\u2019s wall and that which she draws eyes with eyebrows could be described as bushy, full, or prominent.\"",

I can't imagine a more specific fact.\"",
      "The new filing also reveals DM had \"lucid dreams of being kidnapped or chased,\" she was a consumer of true-crime TV and podcasts.",
      "\"I think the judge will allow it on the grounds that DM will be subject to cross-examination and that the unreliability of the identification goes to the weight that the jury will give the description, not the admissibility of it,\" Elcox, who has been closely following the case, told Fox News Digital. \"But \u2026 this identification can absolutely be destroyed on cross-examination.\"",
      "Judge Hippler previously said DM's testimony appeared more useful in establishing a timeline of the slayings than identifying the attacker.",

      "Carney recently criticized President Donald Trump as a \"bully\" in a statement he released in response to American tariffs being put on the northern neighbor. \"Canada will not bow down to a bully. We won\u2019t stand by as illegal U.S. tariffs hurt our workers and their families. As Canadians, we need to face this challenge as one united team.\"",

      "On fundraising, Carney has amassed the most campaign contributions with $1.3 million \u2013 or more than double what Freeland, a former foreign affairs minister, collected last month.",
      "Polls have also shown that Carney is the frontrunner to become the next Liberal leader. Should he hold that job and automatically become Canadian prime minister as Trudeau\u2019s successor, he would help boost his party\u2019s fortunes at the ballot box.",

      "However, the same recent Angus Reid poll also found that 43% of Canadians believe Carney would be best suited, as prime minister, to deal with Trump, compared to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, at 34%.",

During his leadership run, the former central bank governor said he would replace it with an incentive program that rewards Canadians for \"making greener choices,\" such as purchasing an energy-efficient appliance.",
      "In a Jan. 26 open letter to Carney, Poilievre asked him whether he would be \"any different than the man you are trying to replace\" and commit to \"banning any prior Trudeau minister from serving in your Cabinet\" or \"pursue the same Trudeau agenda?\"",

      "Last Wednesday, Carney said he would remove domestic trade barriers between the 10 provinces and three territories that would expand the Canadian economy by up to $140 billion.",

      "The United Nations' annual report on children in conflict zones isn\u2019t set to come out until June, but the draft report obtained by Fox News Digital is already causing concern. The report excludes several examples of Israeli victims of the ongoing war, while lobbing accusations at the Jewish state.",
      "Throughout the section of the report on Israeli and Palestinian children, there are instances of the U.N. conflicting verified and unverified data. Though the report admits that there is unverified data, it does not give any information on who was responsible for verifying the other figures. This lack of transparency leaves room to doubt the report\u2019s accuracy.",

      "The report claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) kidnapped a Palestinian girl. While it is stated that the incident was verified, the U.N. provides no information on who did the verification. There are also no details about the incident in the report. It does not say where the child was allegedly abducted or whether she is alive.",
      "In one of its more egregious claims, the report accuses IDF soldiers of using 27 Palestinian children as human shields in the West Bank and Gaza. Once again, the report claims these cases have been verified but does not say who confirmed them. The use of human shields is not a known IDF practice, but it is something Hamas has been accused of doing for years.",

      "Israel is also slammed in the report for denying Palestinians humanitarian aid. However, there is no mention of Hamas and Palestinian armed groups looting aid trucks. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in November 2024 that of the 109 aid trucks that crossed from Israel into Gaza, 97 were \"violently looted.\"",

Additionally, the draft report contains no mention of the 12 Druze children killed by Hezbollah rocket fire while playing soccer in northern Israel.",
      "\"The secretary-general once again chooses to blatantly ignore the violence and harm done to Israeli children. Based on this report, Israeli lives do not matter and are not worthy of attention. Israel will not let diplomatic terrorism prevail,\" Ambassador Danon told Fox News Digital.",

      "A South Korean court on Friday ordered impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol to be released from jail, a move that could allow Yoon to stand trial for his rebellion charge without being physically detained.",
      "Yoon was arrested and indicted in January over the Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into political turmoil. The opposition-controlled parliament separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",
      "The hearings in his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court concluded in late February, and that court is expected to rule soon on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said it accepted Yoon\u2019s request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "SOUTH KOREAN PROSECUTORS INDICT IMPEACHED PRESIDENT WHO DECLARED MARTIAL LAW",

      "The court also cited the need to resolve questions over the legality of the investigations on Yoon. Yoon\u2019s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he\u2019s convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon's defense team welcomed the court's decision and urged prosecutors to release him immediately. The presidential office also welcomed the court\u2019s decision, saying it hopes Yoon will swiftly return to work.",
      "However, South Korea law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect whose arrest has been suspended by a court temporarily while pursuing an appeal.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon\u2019s Dec. 14 impeachment, called on prosecutors to immediately appeal the court\u2019s ruling.",

      "IMPEACHED SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT DETAINED WEEKS AFTER MARTIAL LAW CHAOS",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree, which involved the dispatch of troops and police forces to the National Assembly, evoked traumatic memories of past military rules among many South Koreans. The decree lasted only six hours, as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall and voted to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon\u2019s impeachment, he will be officially thrown out of office and a national election will be held to choose his successor within two months. If the court rejects his impeachment but he is still in jail, it's unclear whether and how soon he will be able to exercise his presidential powers.",

      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have filled the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide.",
      "Yoon is the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office. South Korean law gives a president immunity from most criminal prosecution, but not for grave charges like rebellion or treason.",
      "By law, a president in South Korea has the power to put the country under martial law in wartime and similar emergency situations, but many experts say South Korea wasn\u2019t in such a state when Yoon declared martial law."

However, the possibility of other countries that provide major funding to the international body reassessing their spending as well could be causing further concern.",
      "However, Dujarric denied the memo was a \"direct result of the political situation in the U.S.\" and that the U.N. has \"faced a liquidity crisis\" for decades, as \"not all member states pay in full\" or \"on time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The call that would upend his life came 11 years ago.",
      "His daughter had hanged herself; she was now on life support.",
      "He rushed to her bedside, but eventually the time came when the machine would be turned off.",
      "The father placed his hand on his daughter\u2019s chest, found her heartbeat and willed her to hang on.",
      "Her heart slowed and slowed and slowed. Then it stopped.",
      "She was gone.",
      "The anguish crashed down on him like a tank, compounding the despair he carried after another suicide 14 years earlier. He and his brother had found his father, a Vietnam War veteran, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "In an interview, the 54-year-old suicide prevention case manager with the Department of Veterans Affairs painfully recalled his agonizing journey, which also included beating cancer, as he grappled with a new crisis of his own.",
      "The world he turned to for salvation \u2014 returning to school at age 46, specifically to become a social worker so he could work in suicide prevention with veterans \u2014 was now in turmoil.",
      "Like the roughly 2 million workers across the federal government, he is watching his colleagues and the veterans he\u2019s trying to help lose their livelihoods or weather a barrage of messages that federal workers have no value \u2014 often coming directly from the president and the people he has empowered.",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a purpose in life and you found your thing, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s being destroyed \u2014 you lose all hope,\u201d the suicide prevention manager said, his voice fading. The federal worker, like others quoted in this story, asked that he remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.\u00a0\u201cI hurt for everybody who\u2019s impacted by it, you know? I mean, I hate to say it, but I work in suicide prevention and I had thoughts. I\u2019ve had thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke with 20 federal employees across agencies. Spanning the country, these workers lost their jobs, watched co-workers lose them or endured what amounted to a Goliath joyously stomping on David. In interviews, federal workers \u2014 many of whom are veterans \u2014 told of overwhelming stress, personal crises, suicidal ideation, rapid weight loss, prolonged lack of sleep, panic attacks and visiting the emergency room after a mental breakdown.",
      "They\u2019re facing bombardment from every angle, some showing screenshots to reporters of offensive messages delivered over text and social media, which in turn echo misinformation that billionaire Elon Musk has elevated on his X platform \u2014 for example that federal workers are lazy, that they themselves are a source of waste and fraud, and that they don\u2019t bother to come to the office.",
      "Some, particularly veterans or those who assist veterans, expressed fury they\u2019re being denigrated by Musk and a president who never wore a military uniform. Trump, a president for whom some of them voted, even posted an insulting meme about federal workers on his Truth Social account that showed an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob holding a list.",
      "It read, \u201cGot done last week,\u201d an apparent reference to Musk\u2019s request of federal workers that they send an email pointing to five things they did at work. \u201cCried about Trump. Cried about Elon. Made it into the office for once. Read some emails. Cried about Trump and Elon some more.\u201d",
      "Sarah Boim, a 38-year-old who was fired from her job with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said she grew so distraught that her therapist told her to find a psychiatrist and immediately get on an antidepressant. Boim said she and her husband cannot pay their mortgage on one income and she is desperately searching for work.",
      "\u201cYour career is ripped away from you, with no money to move forward,\u201d Boim said. \u201cI have bipolar. It\u2019ll mess up my life if I have an episode. So we\u2019re just trying to be really careful. I\u2019m hearing stuff like that across the agency.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew there would be reorganization. I wasn\u2019t expecting this level of chaos,\u201d Boim added. \u201cTaking a sledgehammer approach and having an unelected billionaire in my email is just insane. What are his qualifications for doing this? The government is not a startup; we have been in business since 1776.\u201d",
      "Some who voted for Trump said they regret believing him as a candidate when he said he rejected Project 2025, whose co-author Russell Vought said he wanted to put federal civil servants \u201cin trauma.\u201d\u00a0Once in office, Trump tapped Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a powerful post.",
      "\u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\u201d Vought said in a speech in the lead-up to the Nov. 4 election. \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.\u201d",
      "So far, they say, Vought is succeeding.",
      "One Department of Defense employee who did two tours in Iraq said his post-traumatic stress disorder was triggered to the point that he called a suicide hotline, then visited an emergency room at a veterans hospital. The employee said he and colleagues felt unspeakable frustration and anger after relentless mocking by Musk that was supported by Trump, who he said appeared to be delighting in the distress of his own workforce.",
      "The worker said his episode emerged the weekend Musk made a display of joyously lifting a chain saw while appearing at a conservative conference. In that same period, employees were deluged with messaging from Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, that ranged from termination notices to confusing emails that were often contradicted by supervisors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about the layoffs. It\u2019s about a dehumanization of who we are and what we do,\u201d he said, noting he voted for Trump because he liked what the president did in his first stint in office. Now, he said, he carries guilt over his Trump vote after he watched co-workers and other veterans at the emergency room. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it for the applause. We do it to serve our country and serve our community. You get into public service not for the money but because you want to be part of something greater than yourself.\u201d",
      "Katherine Freeman had been working for 10 months as an administrative assistant for the CDC specializing in tuberculosis when she received a mass email saying she had been fired because of her performance. She had received only positive performance reviews and was in line for a promotion.",
      "\u201cThis really knocked me off my feet to get a generic letter that is basically a template. It didn\u2019t even have my name on it. It was just attached to an email,\u201d said Freeman. \u201cTo tell people who are performing well that they\u2019re being terminated for poor performance and you\u2019re not getting a severance package, that\u2019s just a cruel way to to handle your employees. I think that\u2019s what people are upset about.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody understands that the government needs to spend less money, and we get that. But if you\u2019re going to do a layoff, do a layoff the right way.\u201d",
      "One VA worker who was just fired, a mother of three young kids,  said colleagues all around her are sinking into hopelessness.",
      "\u201cYou wonder what is going to happen in the world, in general. What will that look like for our children?\u201d she said. \u201cFor other people\u2019s kids, they say, \u2018It\u2019s not just my life, but my children\u2019s lives. Where are we going?\u2019\u201d",
      "A different VA worker who served in the Navy for more than a decade described having dropped 20 pounds in a month and losing her hair. She, like others, described behavior from Musk and Trump as taunting and triggering a sense of powerlessness and anger. Reaching a breaking point, she called a suicide hotline for help.",
      "\u201cServing my vets is what I live for. They need me. They need an understanding person on the other end of the phone call,\u201d said the woman. \u201cI will be destroyed if they fire me.\u201d",
      "None of the workers opposed cutting excess. But many described what they saw playing out in their agencies as chaotic and haphazard \u2014 like rushing to push boxes off a sinking Titanic without looking at what was inside.\u00a0Some said their abrupt dismissal would leave programs in the lurch, like those that help farmers or facilitate trade for small businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like so many other government employees I talked to. It\u2019s their f-----g mission in life to help veterans who are struggling. Please quote me on that,\u201d the VA suicide prevention manager said. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to have a person that can, to my face, tell me that my job is not needed. I just tell people what I do and ask them to explain to me: What part of my job is waste or fraud?\u201d",
      "The defense employee, whose job entails refurbishing and updating technology on Navy ships, said the constant attack on federal workers has made him want to walk away, move to the private sector and draw a bigger salary. But he recalled during one of his Army tours in Iraq that his unit needed armor reinforcement on its Humvee. A federal worker came through for him in that perilous moment.",
      "\u201cI get to do that now, with sailors in the Navy. I\u2019m working to help sailors in the Navy be prepared to engage the Chinese if they go after Taiwan,\u201d the defense worker said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to quit, not going to give up. Because I\u2019m not just giving up on my country, I\u2019m giving up on the sailor and the war fighter that is going to be in immense danger if I do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of us are remembering: what we do and why we do it, and it\u2019s bigger than this stupid political stuff. This is people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doges-amy-gleason-ex-nurse-data-cruncher-straight-shooter-rcna195114",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Amy Gleason, a nurse turned health care technology consultant, was recently named the acting administrator for DOGE. How much control she has at DOGE is unclear.",
    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, a former emergency room nurse turned health care technologist, was scared. It was 2010 and no doctor could figure out what was behind her daughter Morgan\u2019s strange constellation of symptoms, including rashes and muscle weakness so severe that she could no longer walk upstairs.",
      "When Morgan was finally diagnosed with a rare and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder after more than a year, Gleason became determined to empower other patients so they didn\u2019t face similar delays in diagnosis.",
      "\u201cIf a doctor had seen all of these visits and activity on one single screen put together, they probably would have wondered why this 10- or 11-year-old is going to the doctor all the time,\u201d Gleason said in a 2020 TEDx talk. \u201cAnd maybe that would have sparked a faster diagnosis.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Gleason, 53, had been a relatively low-profile health care data cruncher with a passion for simplifying access to electronic medical records.",
      "Then, at the end of February, the White House announced Gleason had been named the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, elevating her to a prominent position in the Trump administration.",
      "Gleason previously worked on projects related to health data at the U.S. Digital Service, DOGE\u2019s predecessor, overlapping with Trump\u2019s first term and the Biden administration.",
      "However, the White House has not provided details about why, exactly, it selected Gleason to lead DOGE \u2014 a task force unit at the center of the administration\u2019s efforts to streamline the federal government.",
      "The move has led many to question whether Gleason is truly in charge or if the power resides with Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and a special government employee who has been the face of DOGE.",
      "For weeks, the administration evaded questions about who was actually at the helm; the White House said Gleason was the acting administrator only after administration lawyers were unable to answer who was in charge of the agency when questioned in court. Gleason does not appear to have made any public comments since the White House announced that she was DOGE's top official.",
      "The administration has also revealed very little about who else works for DOGE and what they do, despite Musk\u2019s claims of transparency.",
      "Even with Gleason\u2019s title, Musk still seems to hold sway. As recently as Tuesday, Trump referred to DOGE as \u201cheaded by Elon Musk,\u201d setting off fresh legal questions about the group\u2019s operations. The working relationship between Musk and Gleason is unclear, and a DOGE spokesperson did not respond Friday to questions from NBC News about Gleason\u2019s job responsibilities.",
      "Gleason also did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In interviews, former colleagues described her as highly intelligent and the most valuable asset wherever she works.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of person you need in a role like this,\u201d said Dr. Gregg Alexander, a pediatrician in London, Ohio, who has known her for about 20 years. \u201cShe\u2019s always tried to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Still, some former colleagues worry that in her DOGE role, Gleason will be inadvertently complicit in cuts to programs that have personal significance to her \u2014 including research for rare disease funding. DOGE has threatened dramatic budget cuts to federal health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The condition that Gleason\u2019s daughter, who is now in her mid-20s, was diagnosed with is called juvenile dermatomyositis. The extremely rare disease is a form of juvenile myositis, in which a child\u2019s immune system attacks its own cells and tissues.",
      "Therapies discovered over the years thanks to partnerships with NIH have improved the prognosis for juvenile myositis, said James Minow, executive director at the advocacy organization Cure JM Foundation, where Gleason served as a board member and vice president for research from 2014 to 2018, according to her LinkedIn profile.",
      "But with the Trump administration trying to cut NIH grant funding, Minow said he worried that DOGE could hamper the rare disease research that Gleason\u2019s family and so many others depend on.",
      "\u201cAmy is a very thorough thinker, and I think that she\u2019ll be one who will make very solid, reasoned recommendations to the president as he looks at fulfilling what he sees as his mission to reduce the size of government,\u201d Minow said. \u201cObviously, Cure JM is wanting to do everything we can to protect NIH\u2019s investment.\u201d",
      "Gleason\u2019s friends and former colleagues describe her as apolitical. From 2018 to 2021, she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, an agency created by the Obama administration after its chaotic rollout of HealthCare.gov. Much of her stint was dedicated to partnering with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to improve patient access to health care records, she said in her 2020 TEDx Talk.",
      "During the latter part of her time there, she worked on the data team for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, creating databases from hospitals and labs that governors and the public relied on to track the virus. Her LinkedIn profile says she rejoined the U.S. Digital Service in January of this year as a senior adviser, though The New York Times reported she was reintroduced at the agency in late December, ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "A long history in the private sector",
      "Gleason has also worked in the private sector at various health care management companies and startups. She held vice president positions at Allscripts, which provided software for electronic medical records, and worked from 2011 to 2018 at CareSync, a Florida-based medical technology startup that she co-founded, according to LinkedIn.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile adds that from 2021 to 2024, she was vice president of product at Main Street Health, which provides care for people in rural areas, and at Russell Street Ventures, a firm dedicated to launching innovative health care.",
      "Both Main Street Health and Russell Street Ventures were founded by entrepreneur Brad Smith, an early senior DOGE member who was previously named as head of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation in 2020 during Trump\u2019s first administration.",
      "Smith did not respond to a request for comment; according to anonymous sources who spoke to The New York Times, Smith began advising on Musk\u2019s cost-cutting moves late last year and brought Gleason in on the talks. NBC News has not confirmed the report.",
      "Tom Cooke, a retired health care executive who worked closely with Gleason more than 15 years ago, said her position at DOGE was \u201ckind of a curveball.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll put my politics on my sleeve: I don\u2019t trust Elon Musk at all in this role. I trust her completely,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that she will use her voice strongly and that she\u2019s a straight shooter, whether it\u2019s news that people above her want to hear or not.\u201d",
      "Cooke described Gleason as having an effervescent personality and an unflappable work mentality.",
      "\u201cProfessionally, I put a lot on her plate to get done in a very short period of time, and was amazed by her ability to achieve that,\u201d he said.",
      "And on a personal level, \u201cI\u2019ve seen her be really thoughtful with folks that she may have had just a little bit of interaction with,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just has a way with people.\u201d",
      "Others were also surprised by her DOGE title. One former health care IT colleague told NBC News via a LinkedIn message that \u201cit did seem to come out of nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was shocked to hear of her appointment to DOGE, having been a fierce and committed patient advocate,\u201d wrote the former colleague, who has known Gleason for 15 years and spoke on condition of anonymity because she was concerned speaking out against the Trump administration could have career repercussions. \u201cTo go from such a position of kindness, to a position that eliminates jobs for thousands of working parents, seems like such a dichotomy in values.\u201d",
      "A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Gleason is an avid football fan who likes to needle friends who root for anyone other than the Tennessee Volunteers, said Alexander, the pediatrician. He added that she has a \u201ctremendous sense of humor\u201d and loves to travel.",
      "Gleason\u2019s interest in streamlined medical records and other improvements for patients dates back decades. In 2021, she told the \u201cTell Me Where IT Hurts\u201d podcast, which examines the intersection between health care and technology, that she started out as an emergency room nurse and \u201cquickly realized how powerful health care technology could be.\u201d",
      "Gleason has said the best career advice she has received was from her parents. She told another health care podcast in 2023 that her dad taught her mistakes are a learning opportunity, and her mom encouraged her to follow her dreams.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a pretty great career trying a lot of new things and following my passions as I develop new ones as well,\u201d she told the podcast."

    "summary": "In Chinatowns across the country, people worry about the potential damage to business, loss of cultural traditions and the already high rates of poverty in these immigrant communities.",
    "story": [
      "NEW YORK \u2014 Amid newly imposed tariffs on China, one spiritual wares store selling feng shui products fears the closure of longtime neighborhood establishments. A pack of noodles could increase by at least a dollar. The cost of takeout containers could hike up delivery prices. Overall, businesses in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood, which are particularly import-heavy, are looking at a potential 8% increase in prices.",
      "But tariff fears are not just about financial concerns. In Chinatowns across the country, people worry about the loss of cultural traditions and the already high rates of poverty in these largely immigrant communities. In New York City, for example, 28% of Chinatown residents live below the poverty line.",
      "Chinatowns contends with a unique crisis because many of the items sold there aren\u2019t often available on mainstream platforms like Amazon. And there\u2019s simply not enough demand for them for companies to build factories in the U.S.",
      "Trump added a 10% tariff on all imports from China this week on top of a previous 10% tariff he had imposed on Chinese goods last month. These are in addition to tariffs of up to 25% Trump imposed during his first term. He said the import taxes, which he also imposed on Canada and Mexico before temporarily pausing them, will be in place until China takes action to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "China has retaliated by imposing tariffs of its own on the U.S., adding up to 15% on some U.S. goods.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a Tuesday briefing.",
      "Many of the stores in Chinatowns across the U.S. source the majority of their items from China. Wing On Wo & Co. in New York City, for example, gets 90% of its goods from the country. Lining the shelves are porcelain and ceramic wares, from ornate patterned serving trays to incense holders shaped like bok choy leaves. Fifth-generation store owner Mei Lum said much about the store\u2019s business strategy, particularly during its busy season around Lunar New Year and Christmas, is now uncertain."

      "Sky-high egg prices have drawn renewed attention to the bird flu outbreak, which has caused more than 166 million wild and domestic birds in the U.S. to die since it began in 2022.",
      "While the health risk to most people remains low, the outbreak has continued to surprise researchers and the federal government has been unable to wrangle it under control.",
      "\u201cIt seems like another battle keeps popping up day after day,\u201d said Andrew Bowman, an influenza expert at Ohio State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cI really hate saying \u2018unprecedented,\u2019 but it sure feels different than anything before.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked its readers on social media what they wanted to know about the outbreak, mitigation measures and eggs. Here are the answers to your (lightly edited) questions.",
      "Is it safe to buy and eat chicken? What about eggs? And milk?",
      "Yes, it\u2019s safe to buy and eat poultry products, which are tightly regulated and frequently tested. Moreover, the virus is eliminated through cooking.",
      "\u201cBetween testing and safe food handling, any poultry being consumed from a grocery store would be safe in my mind,\u201d Bowman said, adding that flu viruses are \u201cvery easy to inactivate via heat.\u201d",
      "The Food and Drug Administration continues to recommend cooking eggs until both the yolk and white harden.",
      "Eggs from backyard flocks that have direct contact with migrating waterfowl might be more concerning, but avian influenza generally hampers egg production and causes most birds to die.",
      "\u201cBirds that have avian influenza die and they\u2019re sick and they don\u2019t lay eggs,\u201d said Amber Itle, the state veterinarian of Washington state.",
      "In milk, meanwhile, pasteurization inactivates the virus, making commercially produced milk safe for consumption. However, raw milk is extremely risky because the virus replicates in cows\u2019 mammary glands.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where the virus is in the dairy cows,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who studies infectious diseases.",
      "How does bird flu spread on farms?",
      "Avian influenza, or H5N1, is an extremely contagious and deadly respiratory virus for birds. Once infected, the animals rapidly replicate the virus and spread it through airborne particles, feces, droplets of saliva and nasal excretions.",
      "Some recent, early studies suggest that the virus can even travel from farm to farm in dropping particles carried by the wind.",
      "On dairy farms, infected cows shed the virus through their mammary glands, so they are most likely infected through milk and during milking.",
      "Studies suggest that farm cats have gotten the virus from drinking raw milk.",
      "Is the only way to stop bird flu to kill off all diseased birds?",
      "When a bird flu outbreak is identified, federal policy requires that the virus be stamped out, meaning all the birds must be culled, or \u201cdepopulated.\u201d",
      "There are few other options once the virus begins to infect a farm or backyard coop, given that any surviving birds could spread the virus further. Most would die either way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019d expect over 80% mortality,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIf you let it continue to smolder, will you have some birds that survive? Yes, you will. But at what cost? Because you have to view each one as replicating and making more virus.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is also investing in enhanced biosecurity measures to stop bird flu from reaching farms. Strict programs require workers to shower in and out at work sites, regularly disinfect barns, prevent wildlife from getting in and wash vehicles, among other measures.",
      "Bowman said those strategies help, but it\u2019s still tough.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of easy to have a lapse in biosecurity someplace. Think about telling your kids to pick up their room every day. Do we ever get a day where someone doesn\u2019t do it \u2014 well, that\u2019s the day the virus gets in,\u201d Bowman said.",
      "Unlike birds, cows can recover after a bird flu infection, so they do not have to be culled.",
      "How many egg-laying hens have been culled versus chickens raised for meat?",
      "Egg farms have taken the harder hit.",
      "In January, about 23 million birds were culled on American farms, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of those, about 18.8 million were \u201clayers\u201d bred to produce eggs while just 2.2 million were \u201cbroilers\u201d raised for meat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing drastic reductions in the broiler flock compared to the laying flock,\u201d said John Cranfield, a professor and agricultural economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.",
      "Layers and broilers are different birds with different genetics. The lengths of their lives also differ, making egg production more exposed to the virus.",
      "\u201cIt takes about a month and a half, maybe seven weeks to get a broiler chicken to its market weight,\u201d said John Cranfield, a professor and agricultural economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario. \u201cWhereas an egg-laying hen is going to be about five months to get to the point of laying eggs and then it\u2019s probably going to be laying eggs for a year.\u201d",
      "Since January 2020, the price of a carton of eggs has risen from about $1.46 on average to $4.95, according to Federal Reserve data. Meanwhile, a pound of chicken breast has risen from $3.06 to $3.97.",
      "Eggs are also more difficult to replace in people\u2019s diets.",
      "\u201cEven with big changes in prices, there\u2019s very little change in demand,\u201d Cranfield said.",
      "What happens to the carcasses?",
      "How affected birds are killed depends on how a farm is set up, the species and the number of birds. To mass-cull birds, options include spraying foam throughout a barn to suffocate the birds quickly, and gassing them by rapidly increasing the C02 concentration or by shutting down ventilation (the most controversial method).",
      "Itle said Washington state views the CO2 method as most humane. Overall, she said, culling birds takes a toll.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the worst part of my job and it\u2019s been really, really hard on myself, on responders who are on these cases and for farm workers, because we\u2019re all in this business to protect animal health,\u201d Itle said.",
      "At smaller operations, birds\u2019 carcasses are often incinerated. When large commercial flocks are infected, carcasses are composted in a specialized process that involves heat, added nitrogen, water and microorganisms.",
      "Itle said compost piles can stretch for miles at a big farm. Workers will turn the piles and check their temperature and ensure it reaches 131 degrees Fahrenheit for three days in a row to inactivate the virus.",
      "\u201cComposting is lovely. It\u2019s such a good, sustainable way of dealing with this virus,\u201d Itle said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you get this great nutrient rich product where the viruses have all been inactivated.\u201d",
      "Are ducks, crows, pigeons and other birds dying, too?",
      "Avian influenza is circulating widely among wild birds. The USDA has confirmed infections in more than 12,000 wild birds across more than 170 species.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks on farms have been tied to seasonal migrations of wild birds, which can contaminate equipment and feed, and infect poultry through droppings or direct interactions.",
      "Can bird flu spread from animals to crops?",
      "Experts are not very concerned about crop contamination.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a good reason to wash vegetables \u2014 shigella, E.coli, listeria,\u201d Chin-Hong said. \u201cYour risk of getting those other foodborne disease are higher than getting bird flu.\u201d",
      "Can bird flu spread among people?",
      "Scientists don\u2019t think there have been cases of human-to-human transmission yet, but research suggests that it could be possible if the virus mutates.",
      "Of the 70 human cases confirmed in the U.S. so far, most have been in farmworkers.",
      "But the more times the virus jumps from animals to people, the greater the risk that it will undergo random genetic changes that would enable it to spread person to person.",
      "\u201cThe fewer transmission events you have, you lower the risk of random mutations to figure out the combination to get into our bodies,\u201d Chin-Hong said.",
      "Will bird flu become the next human pandemic?",
      "Scientists have worried for decades about this version of bird flu because human immune systems have not dealt with it before. The sheer amount of virus in wild birds and farm animals does increase the risk of it spreading to people.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t promise this particular bird flu will be the next big one, but there have been four influenza pandemics since the beginning of the 20th century and they all have had their origins in avian flu,\u201d Chin-Hong said.",
      "Are there bird flu vaccines for people?",
      "The federal government has two bird flu vaccines stockpiled, but they would need FDA authorization.",
      "Scientists are also developing new vaccines using mRNA technology, which was first used against Covid. But Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was weighing whether to pull funding for an mRNA bird flu vaccine being developed by Moderna.",
      "Is there a vaccine strategy for chickens?",
      "Chickens can be vaccinated against bird flu, and countries like France are already doing so. But the USDA has not approved such a vaccine.",
      "So far, the U.S. has been resistant to a chicken vaccination strategy because exporters of poultry participate in a program that requires testing for avian influenza antibodies in flocks. The antibodies are evidence of an immune response to a viral infection, but vaccines would lead chickens to produce the same antibodies, which would confuse the results.",
      "\u201cWe do have vaccines that have been proven efficacious,\u201d Bowman said, but added that \u201cto put a vaccine on the market, we\u2019d also have to change the entire testing assurance strategy and we\u2019d have to negotiate that with all our trade partners.\u201d",
      "Any vaccination strategy would also have to account for the fact that vaccines wouldn\u2019t eliminate infections or illnesses entirely, and that wild birds that spread the virus wouldn\u2019t receive vaccines.",
      "Nonetheless, the Trump administration is putting $100 million toward research on vaccines and therapeutics for poultry.",
      "In a news conference last month, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins described vaccination as a potential solution, but said more testing is needed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not ready. We don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBefore we start sticking our chickens, we need to ensure \u2014 before putting that in the food supply \u2014 we know exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Researchers are in the process of testing vaccines for cows, too.",
      "Has President Trump announced any plans to support farmers? Can they expect aid?",
      "The USDA already provides payments to poultry farmers who have suffered bird flu outbreaks, in part to incentivize early reporting.",
      "\u201cWhen birds are euthanized, we pay them for every live bird that\u2019s left that we have to depopulate,\u201d Itle said.",
      "Through November 2024, the government had paid about $1.25 billion in indemnity and compensation, according to the USDA. Indemnity payments vary, with different prices for \u201cbroiler\u201d versus \u201clayer\u201d chickens.",
      "Some additional funds are available for the costs of culling animals, disposing of their bodies and disinfecting farms afterward.",
      "The USDA announced an additional $1 billion plan to address bird flu last month, of which $400 million is meant to help speed the process for farmers to clean and repopulate their farms, which usually takes about six months.",
      "How long until egg prices fall?",
      "No one knows, since it depends on how quickly officials can get the outbreak under control. And even once that happens, \u201cit\u2019s probably a couple of months at a minimum before they start to see some relief,\u201d Cranfield said.",
      "In the meantime, the USDA\u2019s efforts to help egg producers get back on their feet more quickly after a flock is infected may help a bit.",
      "Bowman said that if he was forced to shake his Magic 8 Ball, he\u2019d say the outbreak may start to slow over the summer.",
      "\u201cA lot of this is tied to the spillover \u2014 the virus moving with migratory waterfowl,\u201d he said, explaining that migratory birds hatch in the spring, then travel and mix together during the fall. \u201cThey amplify virus, new virus strains emerge and spill over, we have that cycle for a while.\u201d",
      "Will tariffs affect egg prices?",
      "It\u2019s not clear yet, though it\u2019s possible.",
      "Any added costs for farmers \u2014 due to more expensive fertilizer, fuel or equipment \u2014 would factor into the price of eggs. The U.S. imports Canadian potash for fertilizer that\u2019s used to grow grains in chicken feed, Cranfield said. However, the Trump administration has announced some exceptions to the sweeping tariffs it issued, including potash, through April 2.",
      "The USDA last month predicted egg prices will be more than 40% higher in 2025 than in 2024.",
      "Why haven\u2019t milk prices gone up the same way eggs have?",
      "Cows can recover after a bird flu infection, and the outbreak in dairy cows has not been as overwhelming as in poultry.",
      "\u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen the same scale of outbreak as we have with birds,\u201d Cranfield said, adding that federal milk pricing policies also provide some stabilization.",
      "If I have birds of my own, how can I protect them?",
      "Pay attention to your animals\u2019 health, limit their exposure to wild birds, keep their enclosures clean and report sick animals.",
      "Are my pets at risk of bird flu?",
      "Cats may be.",
      "The California Department of Public Health documented cases in which cats were sickened after drinking raw milk, and other cats have been sickened after eating rawcat food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also documented a case in which people passed the virus to cats.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t feed them raw milk; don\u2019t feed them raw meat,\u201d Chin-Hong said, adding that outdoor cats will be at greater risk. \u201cTry to not have the cat drink water from a bird feeder.\u201d",
      "Dogs don\u2019t seem to be particularly susceptible, Itle said.",
      "Is it risky if me or my child comes in contact with wild birds or bird poop?",
      "The risk of contracting the virus from the environment remains low, as long as you\u2019re not at a farm. The CDC has only reported a few cases in which there was no known source of exposure.",
      "\u201cBecause the virus isn\u2019t adapted yet to humans, it\u2019s like forcing an ill-fitting key into a lock,\u201d said Chin-Hong. \u201cThe people who have gotten it are in constant contact with high viral loads. That\u2019s why dairy workers are at risk. They\u2019re getting constantly bombarded.",
      "To be safe, though, don\u2019t handle dead birds and make children wash their hands \u2014\u00a0best practices regardless of bird flu."

      "But in recent elections, Alice Weidel took the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from the fringes to the heart of power. Championed by Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, Weidel is part of a growing group of powerful women leading Europe\u2019s ascendant far-right parties, alongside Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen.",
      "With party co-chair Tino Chrupalla, Weidel led the AfD to second place in Germany\u2019s election last month, a triumph for a party being monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "\u201cNobody has done this in Europe in such a short time,\u201d a beaming Weidel said at a news conference after her party secured just over 20% of the vote, doubling its share from 2021.

      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "But six states have passed right-to-repair laws, protecting consumers\u2019 abilities to repair or modify their products.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Mui, founder of Fixit Clinic, describes his repair work as a hobby that\u2019s gotten out of control. What started as a tool share in Berkeley, California, has turned into a volunteer-run group that has organized more than 1,300 repair events around the country. At Fixit Clinics, people can bring any broken household item \u2014 from worn socks to broken toasters \u2014 and learn how to make them functional again.",
      "\u201cDuring the last few years, interest in repair has exploded,\u201d Mui said.",
      "He attributes this cultural shift to a growing awareness about the environmental impact of e-waste, as well as a raft of \u201cright-to-repair\u201d laws passing across the U.S. Historically, manufacturers of computers, cars and tractors have\u00a0cited copyright law to claim exclusive repair rights, allowing them to sue independent repair companies while preventing consumers from finding lower-cost alternatives.",
      "But in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, New York and Oregon \u2014 right-to-repair laws have been passed to protect consumers\u2019 ability to repair or modify their products instead of having to go through the manufacturer. Oregon\u2019s law is the most recent, passing in 2024 and going into effect in January.",
      "As of March, right-to-repair bills had been introduced in all 50 states, and 20 state legislatures are currently debating such bills.",
      "The laws take different forms. Some narrowly target automobile manufacturers while others are broad enough to cover all consumer electronics. Though bipartisan federal legislation for automobile repair stalled last year, it was reintroduced last month. Legal experts say it\u2019s hard to predict the Trump administration\u2019s stance toward right-to-repair laws considering President Donald Trump\u2019s varied relationships with tech executives and the wide array of positions he\u2019s taken on tech issues. But advocates remain hopeful about support among state legislators and constituents for such bills, which have been backed by both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\u201cEvery time there\u2019s been a popular referendum, it\u2019s passed by 70% or more in that state,\u201d Mui said. \u201cSo that creates a lot of mainstream awareness around the idea that stuff should be repairable.\u201d",
      "Legislative wins for right to repair",
      "The modern right-to-repair movement began with challenges to copyright law in 2012, when Massachusetts mandated automakers allow independent mechanics to access the diagnostic tools in cars, which were previously restricted to franchised dealerships. In 2014, Congress legalized phone \u201cunlocking,\u201d allowing phone owners to \u201cunlock\u201d their phones from exclusive use on a specific network and take them to a different carrier. The Library of Congress announced exemptions to copyright law for consumers to modify their tablets and smart TVs a year later.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the right-to-repair battle reached wide public consciousness when consumers questioned why McFlurry machines were always broken at their local McDonald\u2019s. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) made it illegal to bypass certain proprietary systems like the one that Taylor Company, the McFlurry manufacturer, used to fix the equipment.",
      "After a repair startup filed a lawsuit challenging Taylor\u2019s restrictive repair policies, which only allowed its repair people to fix machines, the U.S. Copyright Office announced new exceptions to the copyright law to allow third-party McFlurry repairs. Kit Walsh, a director at the nonprofit rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, welcomed the change.",
      "\u201cManufacturers will always try to figure out another means of restricting independent repair because it\u2019s a very lucrative market for them,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The EFF was part of a coalition that challenged tractor manufacturer John Deere in 2015 over independent repairs and won temporary exemptions to the DMCA. But Walsh wants the federal government to go further.",
      "She said the biggest obstacle to consumer rights is Section 1201 of the DMCA. Enacted in 1998, the section prohibits consumers from accessing protected software in copyrighted products. So far, litigation challenging Section 1201 has been rejected by the courts. What Walsh is betting on are smaller copyright exemptions like those for electric wheelchairs or the state-level push to pass repair bills.",
      "Gay Gordon-Byrne, the executive director of the Right to Repair Coalition, said the group has faced massive lobbying by industrial conglomerates for much of its 15 years of campaigning. At one point, she said, companies like Apple and General Motors that were fighting against right-to-repair legislation represented over $10 trillion in market capitalization.",
      "Since then, some manufacturers including Motorola and Microsoft have started working with repair advocates. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a choice, because consumers are starting to ask questions,\u201d Gordon-Byrne said. \u201cEvery bill that gets passed adds more positive incentive for manufacturers to go back to what they used to do, which is support their customers.\u201d",
      "To empower consumers, the coalition runs a know-your-rights program where people can check what laws are enforced in their state. If the manufacturer of a product is not in compliance with the law, consumers can fill out a form that sends a direct complaint to the state attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s frustration with not being able to fix their stuff has grown,\u201d Gordon-Byrne said. \u201cEven when I sit down with legislators, they hold up their cellphone and ask if right-to-repair will make it cheaper to repair their screen. And they say, \u2018Sign me up.\u2019\u201d",
      "Building a repair skill-sharing economy",
      "Repair Cafe, another extensive repair network, has over 2,500 communities worldwide. Its oldest U.S. chapter, founded in 2012, is Repair Cafe Pasadena, where around 40 volunteers show up every month with sewing machines and toolboxes to fix any item that community members bring in. Its January event was supposed to take place at the usual location, the Altadena Public Library, but the Eaton Fire postponed their meetup.",
      "With many members having lost their homes to the fires, the network has taken on new meaning. \u201cThe idea behind Repair Cafe is to build local resiliency,\u201d\u00a0volunteer Ginko Lee said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to figure out how to help people during this catastrophe, like repairing their generators.\u201d",
      "The Pasadena arm of the global repair network, which draws attendees from all economic backgrounds, keeps its budget at zero through breakfast donations from a local bakery and a volunteer-run coffee station. Volunteers range from expert knitters to former electrical engineers. During the events, community members ask for the repair of treasured belongings or can shop from the \u201cfree market\u201d table. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations going on because people open their hearts to one another during the repairs,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee emphasized that the group\u2019s ethos is mutual help, not charity. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique place where for three hours people help one another without charging money or asking for anything in return,\u201d Lee said.",
      "That\u2019s also the kind of environment that Mui fosters at Fixit Clinics. Because everyone has a unique skill set, his clinics turn into a skill-sharing and cross-training event. \u201cOur events are set up so that really the role of Fixit coach and participant blurs, and everyone\u2019s just helping everybody else out,\u201d Mui said."

    "story": [
      "Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.",
      "The World Health Organization warned this week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,\u201d Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.",
      "Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries \u2014 up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.",
      "The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are \u201cbreaking down,\u201d laboratory services are \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d and surveillance systems are \u201ccollapsing,\u201d making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.",
      "That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.",
      "In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.",
      "\u201cPatients may get a diagnosis of TB after they\u2019ve left the clinic because they\u2019re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There\u2019s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying because they have disease that hasn\u2019t been diagnosed, hasn\u2019t been treated, hasn\u2019t been prevented.\u201d",
      "Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,400 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,000 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.",
      "Any increase in the disease\u2019s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.",
      "A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.",
      "\u201cWhat happens when we travel overseas? I\u2019ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I\u2019ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,\u201d he said.",
      "A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.",
      "The White House did not provide a comment in time for publication.",
      "People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren\u2019t properly treated, according to the WHO.",
      "But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.",
      "Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.",
      "Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.",
      "Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. The State Department slashed nearly 5,800 of USAID\u2019s foreign aid awards \u2014 more than 90% of the total \u2014 according to a lawsuit filed by nonprofits and businesses that receive USAID funding. The awards totaled $54 billion, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver in January allowing USAID\u2019s lifesaving humanitarian programs \u2014 including tuberculosis prevention and treatment \u2014 to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.",
      "The official warned of \u201cpreventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,\u201d then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.",
      "The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on X last month that he was \u201cfeeding USAID into the wood chipper,\u201d and that he and Trump agreed the agency should be shut down.",
      "So far, federal judges have denied requests from USAID staffers and contractors to continue their work while lawsuits challenging their terminations play out. The Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, said the Trump administration had to pay USAID contractors $2 billion for work already completed.",
      "The WHO has a goal to reduce tuberculosis cases by 80% and deaths by 90% by 2030. That was already aspirational but is even further out of sight now, said Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "USAID played a significant role in getting diagnostic tools and treatments over the \u201clast mile\u201d to patients, Shete said. That included finding ways to transport drugs when road conditions were poor and funding mobile clinics that offered X-rays and bacterial testing.",
      "\u201cThe loss of resources to get across the finish line is what\u2019s really disturbing to some people, and will end up costing millions of lives potentially,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts worry the disruption to clinical trials will also hinder the development of treatments for drug-resistant infections and of new ways to detect cases in children, who are often hard to diagnose.",
      "\u201cThe innovations do come back and benefit the U.S. as well,\u201d Davis said."

      "Hundreds of civilians have been killed in Syria in the last 48 hours, according to a war monitoring group, in the deadliest eruption of violence since the fall of the Assad regime in December.",
      "According to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), more than 700 civilians have been killed in what the organization has called \u201cmassacres.\u201d The organization expects the death toll to rise.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace on Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings, and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",
      "Syria\u2019s Presidency released a statement Sunday announcing its decision to form an independent national committee to investigate the events on the Syrian coast, including \"causes, circumstances, and conditions\" that led to the event. The statement also promised to \"identify those responsible.\"",
      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground, and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video footage posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect, and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that revenge killings were initiated Friday by Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, with residents saying Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes, and their houses looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement on Sunday that\u00a0the escalation served as \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile,\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, and challenges Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability, and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "The U.S. decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of\u00a0a tempestuous White House visit\u00a0last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Donald Trump is trying to pressure Ukraine into accepting a peace deal with Russia.",

      "\u201cIt is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort,\u201d he said.",
      "Just 24 hours before the attacks, Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "When asked Friday if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not mention intelligence-sharing Saturday, but said he welcomed Trump\u2019s proposal Friday to\u00a0impose large-scale\u00a0banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final peace settlement is reached.",

After more than three weeks in the hospital, the 88-year-old pope is responding well to treatment and has shown a \u201cgradual, slight improvement\u201d in recent days.",
      "For the fourth Sunday in a row, the 88-year-old Francis didn\u2019t appear for his weekly noon blessing, but he met with his top deputies and the Holy See distributed the text he would have delivered if he were well enough.

      "\u201cBrothers and sisters, during my prolonged hospitalization here, I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,\u201d read the message from Gemelli hospital.",

      "The doctors said that such stability \u201cas a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\u201d It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14.",
      "But they kept his prognosis as \u201cguarded,\u201d meaning he\u2019s not out of danger. On Sunday morning, the Vatican reported he was resting after a quiet night.",
      "In his absence, the Vatican\u2019s day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square, the giant banner bearing Francis\u2019 papal coat of arms fluttered from the loggia of the basilica above. Even while in the hospital, Francis is very much still the pope and in charge of the Catholic Church.",
      "That was evident too by the fact that the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, visited the pope on Sunday, for the third time since he has been in the hospital. The Vatican has noted that such meetings are the routine way the pope governs while at the Vatican, making clear that he was getting essential work done from Gemelli.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future."

    "story": [
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that Americans should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d brace for a recession as President Donald Trump said the U.S. is in a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d as the administration plans to implement far-reaching reciprocal tariffs on goods from foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be no recession in America. ... Global tariffs are going to come down because President Trump has said, \u2018You want to charge us 100%? We\u2019re going to charge you 100%,\u2019\u201d Lutnick told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Lutnick argued that Trump plans to \u201cunleash America out to the world\u201d and \u201cgrow our economy in a way we\u2019ve never grown before.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, if Donald Trump is bringing growth to America, I would never bet on recession, no chance,\u201d the commerce secretary added.",
      "In a separate interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump if he expects a recession this year.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" the president told Bartiromo.",
      "\"There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time, it takes a little time,\" he added.",
      "Lutnick also promised Americans that grocery prices would start coming down in early April but warned that there would be price increases on foreign goods as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s anticipated reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\u201cYes, some products that are made foreign might be more expensive, but American products will get cheaper, and that\u2019s the point,\u201d Lutnick told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, speaking about the effects of the reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods that Trump has said he will impose on April 2.",
      "\u201cThe president is going to negotiate country by country. He\u2019s going to drive down other countries\u2019 barriers, unleashing our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen. They\u2019re going to explode in value and the prices of American produce, grow crops, produce and fish are going to come down,\u201d Lutnick predicted.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is behind them, protecting them,\u201d Lutnick added, referring to American farmers. \u201cHe\u2019s got their back, and he\u2019s going to make them winners. And then all of America is going to be winners, because these prices are coming down. And the process starts April 2.\u201d",
      "In the Fox interview, Trump described his reasoning for the tariffs as protecting Americans from getting \"ripped off.\"",
      "\"Look, our country has been ripped off for many decades, for many, many decades, and we\u2019re not going to be ripped off anymore on the tariffs,\" he told Bartiromo.",
      "Consumers and major retailers felt whiplash last week as Trump issued exemptions to tariffs on Canada and Mexico just two days after he introduced them.",
      "But the exceptions to the tariffs issued last week expire on April 2 \u2014 the same date the president expects to impose reciprocal tariffs on other nations.",
      "On Fox, Trump told Bartiromo that those tariffs will take effect on April 2, and he doesn't plan to grant Canada and Mexico further extensions.",
      "\"It\u2019s a transition into April, and after that, I\u2019m not doing this. I mean, I told them, I said, 'Look, I\u2019m going to do it this one time. But after that, I\u2019m not doing it,'\" the president said.",
      "He also said that the rate of tariffs on foreign nations could rise over time, telling Bartiromo, \"We may go up with some tariffs. It depends. We may go up. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go down, but we may go up.\"",
      "Welker also asked Lutnick about tariffs on dairy, lumber, steel and aluminum that Trump said he would impose on Canada.",
      "Lutnick said tariffs on steel and aluminum would still take effect on Wednesday, March 12, and that tariffs on lumber and dairy products would be delayed until April 2 as well, citing Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods and the need for tariffs to curb the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cSo on April 2, we are going to revisit again the fentanyl issues. And we are going to revisit again the trade, the general trade issues of reciprocality,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "Earlier, Lutnick told Welker that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would end \u201cif fentanyl ends,\u201d blaming both nations for allowing fentanyl to flow over the United States\u2019 northern and southern borders.",
      "\u201cIf fentanyl ends, I think these will come off. But if fentanyl does not end, or [Trump is] uncertain about it, they will stay this way until he is comfortable,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "Grocery prices in particular could be adversely affected by Trump\u2019s tariff plans. In 2021, the percentage of fresh fruit in the U.S. supplied by imports was 60% and 38% for fresh vegetables excluding certain crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Lutnick also spoke about tensions that may have emerged last week between members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "On Thursday, Trump convened his Cabinet to tell members that staffing decisions at their respective departments and agencies are up to them, not Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, which had previously laid off thousands of federal workers across the U.S. government.",
      "Lutnick on Sunday said Trump has made clear that he\u2019s in charge and that Musk is a \u201cpartner\u201d to each Cabinet secretary.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump made clear that Elon is your partner, and that is what we like,\u201d the commerce secretary said. \u201cYou have the greatest businessman and greatest technologist in the world as my partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one watching this TV right now who, if Elon Musk said he was going to come over to their house and help them, wouldn\u2019t, like, cheer,\u201d Lutnick added. \u201cYou have the best technologist and the richest guy in the world saying, \u2018I\u2019ll help you.\u2019 Come on. We want his help.\u201d"

      "PANAMA CITY \u2014 After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\u201cWe are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\u201d Omagh told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances. ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\u201d",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don\u2019t know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \u201cto send a signal of deterrence\u201d to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\u201cOnce I get off the bus, I\u2019ll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\u201d Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama\u2019s border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \u201cblack holes\u201d for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention. One has been vomiting for over a week, another deportee had diabetes and hadn\u2019t had access to insulin in the camp and another person had HIV and also didn\u2019t have access to medicine in detention.",
      "Those who were released, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\u201cMy hope was freedom. Just freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities.",
      "In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn\u2019t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \u201cwe do not accept asylum.\u201d",
      "\u201cNone of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\u201d said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama\u2019s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",
      "That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities.",
      "Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she\u2019d find a way back to the U.S.",

      "Back in the pods, the couple bonded before realizing a glaring difference between them. Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, explained to Ben that she grew up in a conservative household but was no longer religious and she shared that her sister, Lisa, was gay. Sara also expressed her opinions on the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, noting that she felt more engaged in social issues during that time given that George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Ben, a 28-year-old developer, said that he went to church often and that faith played a big role in his life. But he said he had \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d when referring to the LGBTQ+ community and that he was \u201cignorant\u201d toward politics and the BLM movement.",
      "Despite not being on the same page, both thought that their values aligned and they decided to get engaged. When they left the pods, they continued to have lengthy conversations where they discussed conflicting views about religion.

She said she often wondered if their relationship was just \u201csurface, fun, carefree love\u201d and worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Ben remained at the ceremony with his friends. Together, they prayed for him and Sara. Ben said he wanted to unpack everything with Sara, but the couple did not communicate the rest of the episode.",
      "Instead, Sara further explained her decision to the cameras. She said the two were \u201cnot a good fit\u201d and that she could not continue the \u201ccycle\u201d of them trying to sort through their different values.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ben said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Sara\u2019s choice while she offered more insight into their relationship",

      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just come in guns blazing going, \u2018We need to get engaged,\u2019\u201d Vanessa Lachey said of the cast. \u201cThey really pulled back the curtain, if you will, and peeled back the layers of themselves and the couples to really get down to it.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey said this season's geographical location impacted the vibe of the cast and couples, too.",
      "\u201cMinnesota is totally Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different pool of people here. So, every season\u2019s different.

      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",

She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn\u2019t remember following her and that her description didn\u2019t exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn\u2019t find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",
      "The two quickly moved past the tiff and enjoyed their vacation in Honduras. After they returned, they met each other\u2019s families and gushed about their connection.

      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "On the day of their wedding, Virginia decided not to move forward, shocking Devin completely.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just not ready. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\" she said. Virginia and Devin's parents also seemed to be shocked by the move. Virginia\u2019s father hugged Devin and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also, but I think you\u2019re a great guy.\u201d",
      "She explained her decision in a confessional.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn\u2019t get to. We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",
      "She laughed and said \u201cYes!\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t wait to see him in person before running to share the news with her friends.",
      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appeared to come around \u2014 but Joey was still doubtful, as he says in Episode 13.",
      "In the finale, Joey and Monica chose not to get married. Monica felt that Joey wasn't completely ready and he agrees at the altar.",
      "\"If Joey had told me with his words, \u2018I am 100% in. It is you. I know it\u2019s you. I\u2019m certain.\u2019 I feel like it could have been a lot different,\u201d\u00a0she said in a confessional.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",
      "Ben wanted to continue dating but Sara seemed to balk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential,\" she said.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

    "story": [
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller's relationship appeared to be smooth sailing from the moment they connected in the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "The connection was instantaneous once the duo met and soon realized they attended the same high school. Despite finding themselves in a bit of a love triangle with fellow show contestant Brittany Dodson, Buckley and Miller got engaged sight unseen in the pods.",
      "The newly engaged couple quickly put their relationship to the test in the real world and sought to answer the question: Is love really blind?",
      "As the couple heads to the altar during the final installment of shows from this season, let's take a look back at their \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey.",
      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a letter for Virginia to declare his love. At the end, he asked if she would marry him, and the two got engaged.",
      "What happened in Honduras?",
      "Devin and Virginia appeared to be on cloud nine while vacationing in Honduras.",
      "\u201cYou make love so easy,\u201d Devin told his new fianc\u00e9 while they were strolling on the beach. \u201cI love that,\u201d she replied.",
      "After spending more time together, Virginia declared that she felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with Devin and he agreed.",
      "What happened when Virginia and Devin moved in together?",
      "The couple got to know each other more once they returned home from the group vacation and soon moved into an apartment together.",
      "While talking about financial assets, Virginia said she'd like to get a prenuptial agreement and Devin said he'd \u201cnever really thought about that.\u201d",
      "The topic of a prenup came up yet again when Virginia met Devin\u2019s family. They seemed taken aback by the idea and worried that Virginia might already have one foot out the door. Still, Virginia politely stuck to her belief that a prenup is simply \u201cthe modern way of doing things.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Devin agreed to sign the prenup, noting that it was pretty straightforward.",
      "The couple differed on their political views",
      "Politics were somewhat of a point of contention for Devin and Virginia. In Episode 10, they had a serious conversation about their political views after Virginia encouraged Devin to open up about serious topics that could impact their marriage.",
      "Devin said he wasn't \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and didn't have a \u201cstrong stance on it.\u201d He then explained that his family typically has conservative views.",
      "Virginia was open to differing political opinions, but noted that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if Devin was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.",
      "Did Virginia and Devin get married?",
      "As she prepared to walk down the aisle on their wedding day, Virginia reflected on her feelings for Devin.",
      "\u201cI feel very confident about my connection with Devin and I feel his love, and I feel very secure in our relationship. I love Devin and I absolutely see a future with Devin. He\u2019s all the things that I didn\u2019t even know I needed. And I\u2019m just blessed and really fortunate to be here,\u201d she said.",
      "Devin reiterated his fianc\u00e9's sentiments, saying, \u201cI'm happy that I get to marry the love of my life. I do think I hit the jackpot. She's one in a million, just a smart, loving, kind human being. But also on the outside, she's very beautiful.\u201d",
      "When the time came to take the plunge, Devin said \u201cI do\u201d before Virginia expressed her hesitations.",
      "\u201cI love you so much, but I'm just not ready,\u201d she declared, much to the surprise of her father, who expressed shock at his daughter's revelation.",
      "Devin began crying and Virginia said, \u201cI'm just not ready. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\u201d After walking away, Virginia's father hugged Devin, saying, \u201cYou're a very good man. I'm disappointed also, but I think you're a great guy.\u201d",
      "What did Virginia and Devin say about the wedding?",
      "In a confessional interview, Virginia elaborated on her decision to not get married, saying she felt \u201creally bad\u201d for hurting Devin and his family. She explained that she felt the need to \u201cprotect\u201d Devin throughout their relationship, despite his hesitation to talk about certain topics like politics.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",
      "\u201cI was just waiting to see if he would bring it up but he didn't. It made me not so trusting of him,\u201d she said.",
      "Although Virginia knew Devin would be hurt, she felt comfortable with her decision.",
      "\u201cIf my truth in that moment was to not get married, then that was my truth in that moment. I don't regret my decision,\u201d she said.",
      "In his own confessional interview, Devin said he felt \u201ckind of lost\u201d and was struggling to understand Virginia's decision.",
      "\u201cEven though I didn\u2019t get married today,\u00a0I still do believe that love is blind, because I felt that love for Virginia regardless of everything that happened,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As U.S. and Ukrainian officials prepare to meet in Saudi Arabia this week, President Donald Trump has privately made clear to aides that a signed minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv won\u2019t be enough to restart aid and intelligence sharing with the war-torn country, according an administration official and another U.S. official.",
      "Trump wants the deal, which would give the U.S. a stake in Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources, signed. But he also wants to see a change in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s attitude toward peace talks, the officials said, including a willingness to make concessions such as giving up territory to Russia. Trump also wants Zelenskyy to make some movement toward elections in Ukraine and possibly toward stepping down as his country\u2019s leader, the officials said.",
      "Elections in Ukraine have been paused under the country\u2019s constitutional provision for martial law, which has been in effect since Russia invaded in 2022.",
      "\u201cAs President Trump demonstrated by reading President Zelenskyy\u2019s message at the joint session, the Ukrainians have made positive movement. With meetings in Saudi this coming week, we look forward to hearing more positive movement that will hopefully ultimately end this brutal war and bloodshed,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said when asked about Trump\u2019s requirements.",
      "Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine in the aftermath of the U.S. pause in equipment and intelligence sharing this week, making Friday one of the deadliest days for civilians this year, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Most of the casualties occurred in the Donetsk region, in territory controlled by Ukraine. Casualty numbers have been higher so far in 2025 than in 2024, the monitoring agency said.",
      "The U.S. does not have any indication that the pause in intelligence sharing had a direct impact on the Russian attacks, according to the U.S. official and the administration official. They said these large attacks were likely planned before the intelligence and aid stopped.",
      "Congressional Republicans are applying pressure on the White House to restart both aid and intelligence, and the two officials said they are optimistic the flow of weapons and equipment and sharing of intelligence could be restored as early as next week, especially after Zelenskyy pronounced that Ukraine is \u201cready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.\u201d The Ukrainian president also said he and his team \u201cstand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.\u201d",
      "The officials said the U.S. is still sharing defensive intelligence with Ukraine \u2014 that is, information that helps Ukraine\u2019s self-defense against attacks \u2014 explaining that they still have a duty to warn. But they are not providing targeting information against Russian targets. That means the U.S. can warn Ukraine when intelligence shows that Russians are preparing an attack, but they can no longer provide the targeting coordinates for Ukraine to strike first.",
      "The U.S. has provided Ukraine with targeting information, satellite imagery and signals intelligence for most of the past three years.  European allies are now working to bridge some of the gaps, but the lack of U.S. intelligence is already having an impact on Ukraine every day, according to a Western official.",
      "\u201cEvery day hurts Ukraine, and every day gives Russia a more favorable position,\u201d the official said."

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of civilians have been killed in Syria in the last 48 hours, according to a war monitoring group, in the deadliest eruption of violence since the fall of the Assad regime in December.",
      "According to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), more than 700 civilians have been killed in what the organization has called \u201cmassacres.\u201d The organization expects the death toll to rise.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace on Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings, and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",
      "Syria\u2019s Presidency released a statement Sunday announcing its decision to form an independent national committee to investigate the events on the Syrian coast, including \"causes, circumstances, and conditions\" that led to the event. The statement also promised to \"identify those responsible.\"",
      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground, and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video footage posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect, and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that revenge killings were initiated Friday by Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, with residents saying Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes, and their houses looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement on Sunday that\u00a0the escalation served as \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile,\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, and challenges Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability, and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "Each morning, the first thing Alaa Hathleen does is anxiously check his WhatsApp messages with a single question on his mind: \u201cWho will be homeless today?\u201d",
      "Just over two weeks ago, it was his turn. Early on Feb. 18, Hathleen, 25, was still asleep at his family home in the village of Umm Al-Kheir on the outskirts of Masafer Yatta in the Israeli-occupied West Bank when his mother raced into the room, terrified. Israeli soldiers and excavators were outside, she yelled.",
      "Less than half an hour later, they were standing outside their home, watching in horror as an excavator tore through the building, crushing its walls to rubble and snapping its metal roof in half.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Hathleen's home was \"built illegally in a closed military area,\" and that it was demolished \"in accordance with the law.\"",
      "Masafer Yatta\u2019s landscape of rolling hills and small hamlets gained renewed international attention when \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary by Basel Adra, a Palestinian activist, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli investigative journalist, won an Oscar on Sunday.",
      "The film highlighted the violence and abuses committed by Israeli forces and settlers against Palestinians in Masafer Yatta \u2014 but Hathleen said he feared it could \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d for those who lived there, worried that Israeli settlers and forces might increase their attacks in angry retaliation for the film.",
      "Hathleen said he believed it was important to highlight the reality Palestinians face in the occupied West Bank, but in the weeks since the documentary was announced as an Academy Award nominee, he said there had been fresh violence in the area, with Amnesty International warning last week that another village nearby was under \u201cimminent threat of forcible transfer.\u201d",
      "Hathleen, a physical therapist and activist, now sleeps in a large tent outside his brother\u2019s house with other relatives. They feared rebuilding their home only to have it torn down again by Israeli forces, while the threat of a violent settler attack hangs over him and his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard, but what should we do?\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThis is what they want\u00a0\u2014 to kick us out of our land.\u201d",
      "Like Hathleen, Mohammad Hureini, the son of prominent activist Hafez Hureini, who has made headlines for his fight to remain in At-Tuwani in Masafer Yatta, said he was glad the documentary was bringing \u201cgood attention to the situation.\u201d But, Hureini, 20, an activist and university student studying English literature, added:  \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to stop what Israel is committing.\u201d",
      "Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers and forces has soared since the start of the war in Gaza. According to OCHA, the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian aid agency, at least 895 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between Oct. 7, 2023, and March 4 of this year. So far this year, 89 Palestinians in the territory have been killed, with 17 of them children under the age of 19.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the\u00a01967 Six Day War, with Israeli settlers building and expanding Jewish settlements there that have been condemned as illegal under international humanitarian law and counter to U.N. Security Council resolutions, a charge Israel rejects.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

After more than three weeks in the hospital, the 88-year-old pope is responding well to treatment and has shown a \u201cgradual, slight improvement\u201d in recent days.",
      "For the fourth Sunday in a row, the 88-year-old Francis didn\u2019t appear for his weekly noon blessing, but he met with his top deputies and the Holy See distributed the text he would have delivered if he were well enough. In it, the Argentine pope thanked all those who were caring for him and others who are sick and experiencing a \u201cnight of pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cBrothers and sisters, during my prolonged hospitalization here, I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,\u201d read the message from Gemelli hospital.",
      "\u201cAnd while I am here, I think of the many people who in various ways are close to the sick, and who are for them a sign of the Lord\u2019s presence. We need this, the \u2018miracle of tenderness\u2019 which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Francis, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained in stable condition at Gemelli, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday.",
      "The doctors said that such stability \u201cas a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\u201d It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14.",
      "But they kept his prognosis as \u201cguarded,\u201d meaning he\u2019s not out of danger. On Sunday morning, the Vatican reported he was resting after a quiet night.",
      "In his absence, the Vatican\u2019s day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square, the giant banner bearing Francis\u2019 papal coat of arms fluttered from the loggia of the basilica above. Even while in the hospital, Francis is very much still the pope and in charge of the Catholic Church.",
      "That was evident too by the fact that the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, visited the pope on Sunday, for the third time since he has been in the hospital. The Vatican has noted that such meetings are the routine way the pope governs while at the Vatican, making clear that he was getting essential work done from Gemelli.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future."

    "summary": "Health authorities say that the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of USAID raises the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.",
    "story": [
      "Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.",
      "The World Health Organization warned this week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,\u201d Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.",
      "Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries \u2014 up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.",
      "The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are \u201cbreaking down,\u201d laboratory services are \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d and surveillance systems are \u201ccollapsing,\u201d making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.",
      "That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.",
      "In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.",
      "\u201cPatients may get a diagnosis of TB after they\u2019ve left the clinic because they\u2019re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There\u2019s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying because they have disease that hasn\u2019t been diagnosed, hasn\u2019t been treated, hasn\u2019t been prevented.\u201d",
      "Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,400 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,000 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.",
      "Any increase in the disease\u2019s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.",
      "A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.",
      "\u201cWhat happens when we travel overseas? I\u2019ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I\u2019ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,\u201d he said.",
      "A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.",
      "The White House did not provide a comment in time for publication.",
      "People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren\u2019t properly treated, according to the WHO.",
      "But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.",
      "Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.",
      "Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.",
      "Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. The State Department slashed nearly 5,800 of USAID\u2019s foreign aid awards \u2014 more than 90% of the total \u2014 according to a lawsuit filed by nonprofits and businesses that receive USAID funding. The awards totaled $54 billion, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver in January allowing USAID\u2019s lifesaving humanitarian programs \u2014 including tuberculosis prevention and treatment \u2014 to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.",
      "The official warned of \u201cpreventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,\u201d then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.",
      "The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on X last month that he was \u201cfeeding USAID into the wood chipper,\u201d and that he and Trump agreed the agency should be shut down.",
      "So far, federal judges have denied requests from USAID staffers and contractors to continue their work while lawsuits challenging their terminations play out. The Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, said the Trump administration had to pay USAID contractors $2 billion for work already completed.",
      "The WHO has a goal to reduce tuberculosis cases by 80% and deaths by 90% by 2030. That was already aspirational but is even further out of sight now, said Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "USAID played a significant role in getting diagnostic tools and treatments over the \u201clast mile\u201d to patients, Shete said. That included finding ways to transport drugs when road conditions were poor and funding mobile clinics that offered X-rays and bacterial testing.",
      "\u201cThe loss of resources to get across the finish line is what\u2019s really disturbing to some people, and will end up costing millions of lives potentially,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts worry the disruption to clinical trials will also hinder the development of treatments for drug-resistant infections and of new ways to detect cases in children, who are often hard to diagnose.",
      "\u201cThe innovations do come back and benefit the U.S. as well,\u201d Davis said."

(Officially, she is registered as a resident of \u00dcberlingen, in Germany, just over the border from Switzerland.)",
      "The AfD has opposed gay marriage and the expansion of laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but Weidel has said her sexuality does not conflict with the AfD\u2019s traditional values, and analysts say the party\u2019s rank and file are prepared to overlook her family life as long as she brings them success.",
      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

      "When asked Friday if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans are in thrall to Donald Trump, while Democrats are baffled about how best to oppose him.",
      "Rather than stock his White House with a \u201cteam of rivals,\u201d Trump has opted instead for a den of disciples.",
      "At this point in Trump\u2019s presidency, the most serious and forceful pushback he\u2019s faced has come from two sets of people with little in common: foreign leaders and American judges.",
      "Each has dished out comeuppance that is seldom seen in presidential politics.",
      "Judges have stymied parts of Trump\u2019s agenda they say violate the law, while world leaders have challenged him for taking positions that upend the rules-based order that the U.S. helped build.",
      "In doing so, they risk provoking Trump in ways that could boomerang. Trump is attuned to slights of any kind. Anyone who crosses him, especially on camera, risks his ire.",
      "Trump administration officials told Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy to leave the White House grounds and later paused arms shipments to his country after he clashed with Trump over the state of peace talks with Russia.",
      "Already, Trump\u2019s billionaire aide-de-camp Elon Musk has used his massive public platform to call for the impeachment of judges who\u2019ve impeded Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a troubling aspect to this: The more the Trump administration and the folks that support them say these ridiculous things about federal judges, the more it puts their families and personal safety and courthouses at risk,\u201d Doug Jones, a former Democratic senator and U.S. attorney from Alabama, said in an interview.",
      "Yet neither the courts nor a corps of foreign leaders are deterred. Federal judges have lifetime tenures, after all, and overseas officials answer to their own citizenry. For now, they\u2019re acting as the emergency brake as Trump pushes ahead with plans to remake the world.",
      "In slapping down the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to fire a member of the National Labor Relations Board, a federal judge saw fit to issue a stark reminder of the limits of presidential power.",
      "\u201cA President who touts an image of himself as a \u2018king\u2019 or a \u2018dictator,\u2019 perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,\u201d U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote last week. (Trump said during the campaign he\u2019d be a \u201cdictator\u201d on the first day of his presidency. After scuttling New York City\u2019s congestion pricing system last month, he proclaimed in capital letters on his social media site, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d)",
      "Another judge, William Alsup, in the Northern District of California, ruled in a case involving the Trump administration\u2019s firing of probationary federal workers: \u201cThe ongoing, en masse termination of probationary employees across the federal government\u2019s agencies has sown significant chaos.\u201d",
      "Foreign leaders push back",
      "At least four U.S. allies have publicly rebuked Trump in recent weeks over statements they\u2019ve deemed untruthful or unwise.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave a speech last week addressing Trump by his first name, \u201cDonald,\u201d and telling him that imposing tariffs on Canada was \u201ca very dumb thing to do.\u201d",
      "Aides to Trudeau had given him a draft of the speech beforehand. Deciding he wanted to say something stronger, Trudeau rewrote it, a Western government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "\u201cFrankly he has had enough,\u201d the official said of Trudeau.",
      "\u201cThe Prime Minister spoke quite honestly and was saying the very least that he needed to say in order to deal directly with the level of contempt that has been shown by the president toward him as a person\u201d and toward Canada, the official added.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said in an interview: \u201cWe know Americans love Canadians and Canadians love Americans. This is one person. President Trump has created a total mess. He\u2019s created uncertainty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way you trade with your closest ally and your closest friend in the entire world.\u201d",
      "Both President Emmanuel Macron of France and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stepped in to correct Trump after he claimed Europeans were being paid back for the aid they\u2019ve sent to Ukraine and that U.S. taxpayers had gotten stiffed.",
      "Putting his hand on Trump\u2019s arm in the Oval Office, Macron said without hesitation on Feb. 24, \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank, we pay. We paid 60% of the total effort.\u201d",
      "After Trump said in his Oval Office meeting with Starmer three days later, \u201cWe don\u2019t get the money back,\u201d Starmer told him: \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours. Quite a bit of ours was gifted.\u201d",
      "Both leaders were guests sitting with Trump in the Oval Office as reporters asked questions and the cameras rolled. That they felt compelled to interject and correct Trump is a rarity in such settings, where decorum and deference are the norm.",
      "\u201cForeign leaders don\u2019t normally criticize or correct each other on camera,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, who has served as British ambassador to the U.S., France and Turkey. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t living in normal times. Sometimes the president\u2019s lies don\u2019t matter. But sometimes, because of the office he holds, they do.\u201d",
      "Asked about those moments with Starmer and Macron, a White House official said Trump wasn\u2019t bothered by either. Trump has a long relationship with Macron, and when the cameras were off, the president and Starmer seemed to forge a real connection, the official said.",
      "What\u2019s more, neither man interrupted in quite the same way as Zelenskyy, the official added. (Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, lost their temper with Zelenskyy after he recounted how Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken agreements made with his country over the past decade.)",
      "How world leaders prep to meet with Trump",
      "When world leaders come to the Oval Office, they\u2019re not in the habit of winging it. They arrive with points they want to make and rebuttals they\u2019ve prepared in response to arguments they expect to hear, diplomats say.",
      "As an example, prior to his first-ever meeting with Trump last month at the White House, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers in Tokyo for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings, a person familiar with the planning said.",
      "All that homework paid off. Ishiba arrived for his Oval Office meeting bearing charts that clearly and colorfully illustrated Japan\u2019s investments in the United States, the source said, the sorts of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Ishiba also brought a golden samurai helmet as a gift, two people familiar with the present told NBC News. In Japan, this often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "So, when leaders like Macron and Starmer interject to tell Trump he\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not something they do lightly; they feel they can\u2019t let his statements stand unchallenged, diplomats said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable and certainly to my knowledge, at least, unprecedented. We have some of the most seasoned diplomatic leaders, Starmer and Macron, who know Trump and who know precisely how thin-skinned he is,\u201d said Ned Price, a former State Department spokesman in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThe fact that they did this in this setting, in front of reporters and cameras, only underscores the concerns they have about how these false assertions really get at the fabric of the alliance,\u201d Price added.",
      "Democrats struggle to find their footing",
      "The most natural impediment to Trump\u2019s aspirations would be the opposition party. But Democrats have looked hapless following their defeat in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "At Trump\u2019s speech last week to a joint session of Congress, Democratic lawmakers sat in the House chamber holding up paddles reading \u201cFalse.\u201d Late night talk show hosts mocked that bit of theater.",
      "But Jones sees a way for his party to emerge from exile. Eight years ago, he did the unthinkable in bright-red Alabama, winning a Senate seat. Now, he says, Democrats can recover if they choose their targets more selectively rather than object to the dizzying number of policy pronouncements and walk-backs coming from the West Wing.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have struggled a little bit in part because there was so much hitting quickly,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt was like playing whack-a-mole. You go down one path and Trump reverses course. That may be by design to keep Democrats off their game, and it worked.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut Democrats are beginning to home in on key important points. Medicaid is a really big deal. Health care is a really big deal that\u2019s important to a lot of the swing districts and a lot of red districts.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is Democrats are begging to fine-tune a message. They won\u2019t go down every rabbit hole the administration throws at them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "North Korea unveiled for the first time a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, a weapons system that can pose a major security threat to South Korea and the U.S.",
      "State media on Saturday released photos showing what it called \u201ca nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine,\u201d as it reported leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s visits to major shipyards where warships are built.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, didn\u2019t provide details on the submarine, but said Kim was briefed on its construction.",
      "The naval vessel appears to be a 6,000-ton-class or 7,000-ton-class one which can carry about 10 missiles, said Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University. He said the use of the term \u201cthe strategic guided missiles\u201d meant it would carry nuclear-capable weapons.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely threatening to us and the U.S.,\u201d Moon said.",
      "A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were\u00a0solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u00a0hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and\u00a0multi-warhead missiles.\u00a0North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.",
      "North Korea obtaining a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development because it\u2019s difficult for its rivals to detect such launches in advance.",
      "Questions about how North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines have surfaced.",
      "Moon, the submarine expert, said North Korea may have received\u00a0Russian\u00a0technological assistance to build a nuclear reactor to be used in the submarine in return for supplying conventional weapons and troops to support Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine.",
      "He also said North Korea could launch the submarine in one or two years to test its capability before its actual deployment.",
      "North Korea has an estimated 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world\u2019s largest fleets. However, they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles.",
      "In 2023, North Korea said it had launched what it called its first\u00a0\u201ctactical nuclear attack submarine,\u201d\u00a0but foreign experts doubted the North\u2019s announcement and speculated it was likely a diesel-powered submarine disclosed in 2019. Moon said there has been no confirmation that it has been deployed.",
      "North Korea has conducted a slew of\u00a0underwater-launched ballistic missile tests\u00a0since 2016, but all launches were made from the same 2,000-ton-class submarine which has a single launch tube. Many experts call it a test platform, rather than an operational submarine in active service.",
      "In recent days, North Korea has been dialing up its\u00a0fiery rhetoric\u00a0against the U.S. and South Korea ahead of their upcoming\u00a0annual military drills\u00a0set to start Monday.",
      "During his visits to the shipyards, Kim said North Korea aims to modernize water-surface and underwater warships simultaneously.

      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of\u00a0a tempestuous White House visit\u00a0last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is\u00a0significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled Donetsk region late Friday, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The attack damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances. Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said a Russian drone damaged a Ukrainian fire truck while rescuers fought to extinguish the burning buildings.",

      "Filashkin declared Saturday a day of mourning in the region and warned that more victims could still be found in the rubble.",
      "Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured in Dobropillya. \u201cLast night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\u201d",
      "The wave of attacks took place just 24 hours after Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S.\u00a0suspended military aid and intelligence\u00a0to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Donald Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow. Writing on social media, the U.S. president\u00a0proposed imposing large-scale\u00a0banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final peace settlement was reached.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \u201cEverything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force reported Saturday that Russian troops launched three Iskander missiles and 145 drones over the country overnight. The bombardment contained a mix of attack and decoy drones intended to confuse air defenses. One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops shot down 31 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 26 over the country\u2019s Krasnodar region, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "Falling debris from one drone sparked a blaze at the KINEF oil refinery in Russia\u2019s northern Leningrad region, local Gov. Aleksandr Drozdenko said in a statement. No casualties were reported."

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0The Haydee Guesthouse, with its worn-out carpets and grandmotherly Victorian fa\u00e7ade, makes for an unlikely base for Russian-backed high-stakes espionage.",
      "But for years, the guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a run-down resort town on Britain\u2019s east coast, played host to a freelance spy ring orchestrating cross-continental honeytraps, kidnappings and murder plots\u00a0targeting high-profile dissidents and sensitive military sites.",
      "The details, which seem pulled straight from a spy novel, unfolded in British courts last week after three Bulgarians \u2014 members of a Russian ring operating from their base in the United Kingdom \u2014 were found guilty of conspiracy to spy.",
      "Gabriela Gaberova, 30, a beautician tapped to carry out honeytraps; Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab assistant who was also found guilty of \u201cpossessing identity documents with improper intention\u201d; and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter-decorator and Gaberova\u2019s former partner, made up the ragtag group of amateur operatives who managed to carry out espionage operations for the Kremlin on what prosecutors described as \u201can industrial scale.\u201d",
      "Their handler, a fellow Bulgarian named Biser Dzhambazov, called himself \u201cMad Max\u201d and doubled as a medical courier as well as a knot in the spy ring\u2019s tangled romantic subplot.",
      "Dzhambazov lived with Ivanova before ending their long-term relationship after developing feelings for Gaberova. When police raided the beautician\u2019s northwest London flat in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov and Gaberova in bed together.",
      "Their ringleader was a fifth Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, part spy, part IT specialist, who adopted the name \u201cJackie Chan\u201d in messages to his sidekick, Dzhambazov.",
      "Roussev and Dzhambazov both pleaded guilty to espionage charges following their arrest in 2023.\u00a0A sixth Bulgarian, a mixed martial arts fighter code-named \u201cThe Destroyer,\u201d real name Ivan Stoyanov, also admitted to spying for Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, Roussev\u2019s \u201cminions\u201d \u2014 whom he named after the yellow characters from the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d animated series \u2014 denied the charges.",
      "Instead of being part of the cartoon villain Gru\u2019s scheme, these defendants were real-life operatives working for the Russian intelligence service, also named GRU.",
      "From 2020 to 2023, the gang carried out a series of chaotic and often disorganized covert missions, one of which targeted Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist renowned for exposing Russian involvement in\u00a0the poisoning of MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal with the Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, England, in March 2018.",
      "The group tracked his movements across Austria, Montenegro and Spain, even considering a honeytrap, with Gaberova potentially involved in the scheme.",
      "In 2022, they surveilled Roman Dobrokhotov, a journalist critical of Russia, with discussions of a possible kidnapping. Telegram messages show the group followed him from Budapest to Berlin before losing him at passport control.",
      "In another bizarre plot, the group planned to spray the Kazakh Embassy in London with what Britain\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service described as \u201clarge quantities of fake pig\u2019s blood.\u201d They also schemed to create a false opposition group to stage a protest outside the embassy and feed the sham information about the fake group to Kazakh intelligence in order to boost Russia\u2019s image.",
      "The group also tracked Kirill Kachur, a former Russian official, in Montenegro, planning a kidnapping. They surveilled a U.S. military base in Stuttgart, Germany, focusing on Ukrainian forces. Additionally, they conducted covert operations against former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliyev, attempting to access his residence and gather intelligence.",
      "Investigators uncovered a trove of over 200,000 messages between the operatives, as well as spy equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, including cameras hidden in pens and ties, and videos showing the group surveilling specific sites of interest.",
      "In addition to espionage, the group was implicated in broader Russian efforts to influence foreign political climates and destabilize rival nations.",
      "The three defendants will be held in custody until sentencing in May.",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Scotland Yard\u2019s SO15, which deals with state threats, said it was one of the U.K.\u2019s largest espionage investigations of the last 15 years.",
      "Prosecutors said\u00a0the group was directed by alleged Russian agent\u00a0Jan Marsalek, an Austrian national\u00a0who had contact with Russian intelligence agencies.",
      "The shadowy former chief operating officer of Wirecard, who is wanted in Germany and subject to an Interpol red notice,\u00a0had fled to\u00a0Russia, where he allegedly ran the Bulgarian network.",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnapping and murder of both Grozev and Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until falling out with the Kremlin.",
      "Gaberova, Ivanchev and Ivanova claimed they didn\u2019t know whom they were working for, or that they were lied to by their superiors.",
      "\u201cThis prolonged activity also undermined the security and safety of the UK,\u201d the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement, \u201cand there can be no doubt that each of the defendants knew exactly who they were spying for.\u201d",
      "Russia has been linked to numerous covert operations in the U.K. in recent years as part of its broader efforts to undermine Western security and influence global politics.",
      "In 2022, a 55-page\u00a0report from the Intelligence and Security Committee\u00a0of Parliament said the the country is a target of Russian disinformation, and described Russian influence in Britain as \u201cthe new normal.\u201d"
