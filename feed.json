      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on live stream.",
      "It marked the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",
      "Nickelodeon is celebrating Dora\u2019s 25th anniversary with the feature-length live-action movie \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d a third season of the rebooted animated series \u201cDora,\u201d the podcast Dora\u2019s Mermaid Adventures, an album of songs and plenty of toys and apparel.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d led to what Herles laughingly calls the \u201cDora-verse\u201d \u2014 the spinoff series \u201cGo, Diego, Go!,\u201d a sequel series \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d and the 2019 live-action feature film \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced, Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",
      "Valdes and Gifford originally had the idea for a show about a little girl who was a problem solver. Like \u201cBlue's Clues,\u201d it would reward kids for figuring out answers posed by the host.",
      "\u201cPreschoolers are the least powerful people in our world,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cThey're not able to button their sweater and not able to tie their shoes, but if they\u2019re able to help Dora get to the City of Lost Toys and really feel like they helped, that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy tackles some serious topics like how to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma",
      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",
      "After its strong start last weekend with $12 million, A24\u2019s \u201cMaterialists\u201d held well with $5.8 million in its second weekend. The romantic drama by writer-director Celine Song and starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans has collected $24 million so far.",
      "Next weekend should also be a competitive one in movie theaters, with both \u201cF1,\u201d from Apple and Warner Bros., and Universal\u2019s \u201cMegan 2.0\u201d launching in cinemas.",

      "A judge has denied singer R. Kelly\u2019s request for furlough from prison after the convicted sex offender accused federal prison officials of plotting to murder him",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",
      "Pacold noted that Kelly offers no evidence to back up his claims. Government lawyers suggested Kelly had spun a \u201cfanciful conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

    "story": [
      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "BTS \u2014 short for Bangtan Sonyeondan, or \u201cBulletproof Boy Scouts\u201d in Korean \u2014 debuted in June 2013 under the company Big Hit Entertainment, now known as HYBE. The seven-member group consists of RM, Jin, Suga, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook.",
      "The group launched in 2013 with the hip-hop heavy single album \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool,\" releasing three full-length projects before really gaining momentum with their 2016 album \u201cWings.\" Their global breakthrough came in 2017 when \u201cDNA\u201d entered the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first Korean boy band to achieve such a feat. The song\u2019s success was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, further fueling their international fan base.",
      "The band is largely credited with bringing K-pop to the international stage, and with good reason. Across their discography, BTS broke boundaries and records: In 2020, they released the five-time platinum \u201cDynamite,\u201d their first all-English single, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 a first for an all-South Korean musical act. At the height of their popularity, BTS was not only the biggest K-pop group on the planet, but the biggest boy band overall.",
      "In fact, they've been certified platinum many times over, according to The Recording Industry Association of America. Their platinum successes include:",
      "\u2014 2018's \u201cMic Drop;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2020's \u201cMap of the Soul: 7,\" \u201cLove Yourself: Answer,\u201d and \u201cIdol;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2021's \u201cBe,\u201d and song of the summer \u201cButter;\u201d",
      "\u2014 and high-profile collaborations \u201cMy Universe\u201d with Coldplay and \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d featuring Halsey.",
      "BTS has also been nominated for five Grammy Awards. Their first, for \u201cDynamite\u201d in the best pop duo/group performance category, marked the first time a K-pop act received a Grammy nod.",
      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence. Their fan base, known the world over as ARMY, responded by matching the donation within 24 hours.",
      "Their dual impact on music and social causes culminated in 2022 when they were invited to the White House to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes with President Joe Biden.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",
      "BTS tiered their enlistments, giving ample time for its members to focus on solo projects while the group was on a break.",
      "Jin released two EPs, \u201cHappy\u201d in 2024 and \u201cEcho\u201d in May of this year. Suga dropped his debut solo album, \u201cD-Day,\u201d in 2023 under his moniker Agust D.",
      "Also in 2024, RM released his second solo album, the elastic, experimental \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person\u201d, and j-hope released an EP, \u201cHope on the Street Vol. 1.\" Earlier this year, j-hope embarked on his first solo tour.",
      "Jimin released two projects, 2023's \u201cFace\u201d and 2024's \u201cMuse.\u201d V's debut album, the smooth alt-R&B \u201cLayover,\u201d arrived in 2023, as did Jung Kook's retro-pop debut, \u201cGolden.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- After Hollywood's \u201cNapoleon\u201d exposed the legendary emperor to a new generation, over 100 relics \u2014 which shaped empires, broke hearts and spawned centuries of fascination \u2014 are on display in Paris ahead of what experts call one of the most important Napoleonic auctions ever staged.",
      "His battered military hat. A sleeve from his red velvet coat. Even the divorce papers that ended one of history\u2019s most tormented romances \u2014 with Josephine, the empress who haunted him to the end.",
      "Two centuries after his downfall, Napoleon remains both revered and controversial in France \u2014 but above all, unavoidable. Polls have shown that many admire his vision and achievements, while others condemn his wars and authoritarian rule. Nearly all agree his legacy still shapes the nation.",
      "\u201cThese are not just museum pieces. They\u2019re fragments of a life that changed history,\u201d said Louis-Xavier Joseph, Sotheby\u2019s head of European furniture, who helped assemble the trove. \u201cYou can literally hold a piece of Napoleon\u2019s world in your hand.\u201d",
      "The auction \u2014 aiming to make in excess of 7 million euros ($7.5 million) \u2014 is a biography in objects. The centerpiece is Napoleon\u2019s iconic bicorne hat, the black felt chapeau he wore in battle \u2014 with wings parallel to his shoulders \u2014 so soldiers and enemies could spot him instantly through the gunpowder haze.",
      "\u201cPut a bicorne on a table, and people think of Napoleon immediately,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the laurel crown of Julius Caesar.\u201d",
      "The hat is estimated to sell for at least over half a million dollars.",
      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",
      "\u201cNapoleon was a great lover; his letters that he wrote are full of fervor, of love, of passion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt was also a man who paid attention to his image. Maybe one of the first to be so careful of his image, both public and private.\u201d",
      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",
      "The auction preview is open to the public, running through June 24, with the auction set for June 25.",
      "Not far from the Arc de Triomphe monument dedicated to the general's victories, Djamal Oussedik, 22, shrugged: \u201cEveryone grows up with Napoleon, for better or worse. Some people admire him, others blame him for everything. But to see his hat and his bed, you remember he was a real man, not just a legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Jeezy released his commercial debut two decades ago, he prepared a contingency plan in case his musical aspirations weren\u2019t achieved.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief.

And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "A new COVID-19 variant may be causing \u201crazor blade\u201d sore throats in people who get it",
      "The COVID-19 variant that may be driving a recent rise in cases in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: \u201crazor blade throat\u201d COVID.",
      "That's because the variant \u2014 NB.1.8.1. or \u201cNimbus\u201d \u2014 may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.",

      "Experts say there isn't major cause for concern with the Nimbus variant, but here 's what else you need to know about it.",
      "The rise in cases late last month is primarily in eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, the World Health Organization said May 28. The new variant had reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported globally in mid-May.",

    "summary": "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
    "story": [
      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "April Newkirk told WXIA-TV that 31-year-old Adriana Smith's baby was born prematurely by an emergency cesarean section early Friday, the Atlanta station reported Monday night. She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",

      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",

      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes.

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Indonesian authorities said Monday they arrested 285 people suspected of drug trafficking, including 29 women and seven foreigners, and seized over half a ton of various narcotics during a two-monthlong nationwide crackdown.",
      "Indonesia is a major hub for drug trafficking in Southeast Asia despite having strict drug laws, with convicted smugglers sometimes executed by firing squad.",
      "The head of the National Narcotic Agency, Marthinus Hukom, said the crackdown, launched between April and June across 20 provinces, also uncovered money laundering schemes by two drug syndicates and confiscated assets worth more than 26 billion rupiah (about $1.5 million).",
      "Thirty-six of the suspects, including 21 women, were paraded in front of reporters, along with confiscated drugs, in their orange prison uniforms and hands handcuffed.",
      "Hukom said the women arrested were mostly housewives.",
      "\u201cI call on Indonesian women to be more vigilant in establishing friendships both in the real world and in cyberspace,\u201d he said during a joint press conference with officials from the security affairs ministry and the customs office who took part in the operation.",
      "One of the agency\u2019s deputies, Budi Wibowo, said authorities seized 683,885 grams (0.68 ton) of crystal meth, marijuana, ecstasy, THC, hashish and amphetamines, adding this helped stop them falling into the hands of \u201cmore than 1.3 million people.\u201d",
      "Wibowo also said that drug syndicates have used various methods to distribute narcotics to users via land and sea transportation or mail services.",
      "The seven foreign nationals were an American, two Kazakhs, two Malaysians, an Indian and an Australian, Wibowo said.",
      "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.",
      "In a separate operation, authorities in the province of Riau Island, exposed in May two cases of drug smuggling in its waters and seized 2.7 tons of crystal methamphetamine and 1.2 tons of ketamine, Hukom said Monday.",
      "In 2023, authorities uncovered more than 52,000 of drug cases and confiscated 6.2 tons of crystal meth, 1.1 tons of marijuana and other types of synthetic narcotics, said Mochammad Hasan of the ministry of security affairs during the press conference.",
      "Hasan said the number increased in 2024 with more than 56,000 cases and confiscated 7.5 tons of crystal meth and 3.3 tons of marijuana, with a combine value worth 7.5 trillion rupiah ($454.6 million). Authorities have arrested a total of 27,357 drug suspects by November 2024, he said.",
      "Early this month, three British nationals accused of smuggling nearly a kilogram (over two pounds) of cocaine into Indonesia were charged in a court on the tourist island of Bali. They face the death penalty under the country\u2019s strict drug laws.",
      "About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections\u2019 data showed. Indonesia\u2019s last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.",

      "The subsidies were meant for medium- and small-sized businesses, which Agrofert wouldn\u2019t have been eligible for. The conglomerate later returned the subsidy.",
      "The lower court previously said what Babi\u0161 did was not considered criminal.",
      "Babi has become part of the country\u2019s opposition after his populist ANO (YES) centrist movement lost the 2021 parliamentary election. He also contended for the largely ceremonial post of president in January 2023 but lost to Petr Pavel, a retired army general.",
      "Monday\u2019s verdict comes just months before October's parliamentary election in which Babi\u0161 and his movement are predicted to win the vote.",

    "story": [
      "A long-secret network of tunnels 100 feet below the streets of London could be the city\u2019s next big tourist destination",
      "LONDON -- There is a history-rich part of London that few people have seen, where the city braced for the Blitz, James Bond\u2019s creator got inspiration and secret Cold War messages passed between Washington and Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s a network of tunnels 100 feet (30 meters) below the streets that was secret for decades \u2014 but could be the city\u2019s next big tourist destination. Local authorities have approved plans to fill the 90,000 square-foot (8,400 square-meter) site with an intelligence museum, an interactive World War II memorial and one of the world\u2019s deepest underground bars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing space, an amazing city,\u201d said Angus Murray, chief executive of The London Tunnels, as subway trains rattled overhead. \u201cAnd I think it tells a wonderful story.\"",
      "The tunnels lie directly below London Underground\u2019s Central Line in the city\u2019s Holborn area. Work to dig them began in secret in 1940, when Britain feared invasion by Nazi Germany. They were designed to shelter up to 8,000 people in a pair of parallel tunnels 16\u00bd feet (5 meters) wide and 1,300 feet (400 meters) long.",
      "The tunnels were never used for that purpose; by the time they were finished in 1942 the worst of the Blitz was over, and Underground bosses had opened up subway stations as air raid shelters for Londoners.",
      "Instead, the tunnels became a government communications center and a base for the Special Operations Executive, a clandestine unit that sent agents \u2014 many of them women \u2014 on perilous sabotage missions in Nazi-occupied territory under orders from Prime Minister Winston Churchill to \u201cset Europe ablaze.\u201d",
      "A naval officer named Ian Fleming was a liaison officer to the SOE, and the subterranean HQ may have provided inspiration for the world of secret agent 007 that he went on to create.",
      "\u201cThis truly is the Q Branch of James Bond,\u201d said Murray, referring to the thrillers' fictional MI6 quartermaster and gadget-maker.",
      "After the war, more tunnels were added to the complex and the site became a secure telephone exchange. From the mid-1950s it was a terminus of the first trans-Atlantic undersea telephone cable. After the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war in 1962, a \u201cred telephone\u201d hotline between the Pentagon and the Kremlin was established and ran through here.",
      "Up to 200 people worked underground, bound to secrecy but with the compensation of an onsite canteen and bar. For a time, the site also housed a bunker to be used by the government in the event of nuclear war.",
      "By the 1980s, technology had moved on and British Telecom moved out. The tunnels lay largely forgotten until BT sold them in 2023 to Murray\u2019s private equity-backed group.",
      "Plans include a memorial to the more than 40,000 civilians killed by German bombing in the war, cultural exhibitions and a nightspot that Murray boasts will be \u201cthe deepest bar in the world in a city.\u201d",
      "It also will house Britain\u2019s Military Intelligence Museum, which is currently tucked away on a military base north of London with limited public access. Museum bosses have agreed to move a collection covering more than 300 years of history to the tunnels, bringing a much higher profile for a story they believe needs to be told.",
      "\u201dIt\u2019s not targeted at people who already have an interest in military topics,\u201d said the chair of the museum\u2019s board of trustees, who gave only his first name, Alistair, because of the museum\u2019s connection to Britain's armed forces.",
      "\u201cA heavy theme that will run through the new museum is that there are skills and tools that military intelligence has developed over years and centuries \u2026 and the fundamental one is, how do you tell truth from lies?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very big theme of now.\u201d",
      "The museum also will flesh out the secret story of the Special Operations Executive. The museum\u2019s collection contains agent messages, supplies, weapons and sabotage equipment from the SOE\u2019s wartime adventures.",
      "\u201cMost of the people that worked in SOE never talked about it, either at the time or afterwards, and many of the records have disappeared,\u201d Alistair said. \u201cSo a lot is known about SOE, but we don\u2019t know everything, and the chances are we will never know everything.\u201d",
      "For now, the tunnel entrance is through an unmarked door in an alley, and walking the cool, dim corridors brings the thrill of discovering a hidden corner of history. Within the thick steel and concrete walls are chunky old generators and telecoms equipment, a staff canteen with its kitchen still intact, and the bar, its 1960s orange and brown d\u00e9cor giving off retro \u201cAustin Powers\u201d vibes",
      "Here and there are graffiti tags and a few items left by urban explorers who snuck in over the years, including a set of bowling pins with ball, and \u2014 incongruously \u2014 a bear costume.",
      "London Tunnels aims to open in 2028, and to attract up to 4.2 million tourists a year. That may sound ambitious, but Murray says the site\u2019s mix of \u201chistory and heritage and novelty\u201d makes it a unique draw.",
      "\u201cIf you go home and say, \u2018I went to this really cool tunnel today,\u2019 then we\u2019re halfway there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what\u2019s inside of it is even better, you\u2019re going to go \u2018Oh that\u2019s fantastic.\u2019\u201d",

      "The Battle of Okinawa killed a quarter of the island's population, leading to a 27-year U.S. occupation and a heavy American troop presence to date.",
      "Monday's memorial comes one day after U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, adding to a sense of uncertainty on the island about the heavy American military presence and in its remote islands, already worried about getting embroiled in a potential conflict in Taiwan.",
      "Gov. Denny Tamaki, noting the escalating global conflicts and nuclear threats, made a resolve to contribute to global peace studies, disarmament and the preservation of war remains. \u201cIt is our mission, as those living in the present, to preserve and pass on the reality and lessons to future generations.\"",
      "U.S. troops landed on the main Okinawa island on April 1, 1945, beginning a battle in their push toward mainland Japan.",
      "The Battle of Okinawa lasted nearly three months, killing some 200,000 people \u2014 about 12,000 Americans and more than 188,000 Japanese, half of them Okinawan civilians including students and victims forced into mass suicides by Japan's military.",
      "Okinawa was sacrificed by Japan\u2019s Imperial Army to defend the mainland, historians say. The island group remained under U.S. occupation until its reversion in 1972, two decades longer than most of Japan.",
      "Monday's memorial was held at the Mabuni Hill in Itoman City, where the remains of most of the war dead reside.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was in a hot seat when he attended Monday\u2019s ceremony. Weeks earlier, one of his ruling party lawmakers Shoji Nishida, known for whitewashing Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities, denounced an inscription on a famous cenotaph dedicated to students as \u201crewriting history\u201d by portraying the Japanese army as having caused their deaths, while Americans liberated Okinawa. Nishida also called Okinawa's history education \u201ca mess.\u201d",
      "His remark triggered an uproar in Okinawa, forcing Ishiba days later to apologize to the island's governor, who had criticized the remark as outrageous and distorting history.",
      "The Himeyuri Cenotaph commemorates student nurses who were abandoned near the end of the battle and killed, some in group suicides with teachers. Japan's wartime military told the people never to surrender to the enemy, or die.",
      "Nishida's remarks add to concerns about the whitewashing of Japan's embarrassing wartime past as memories of the tragedy fade and ignorance about the suffering grows.",
      "Ishiba, at Monday's memorial, said Japan's peace and prosperity is built on the sacrifices of Okinawa's history of hardship and that it is the government's responsibility to \u201cdevote ourselves to achieve a peaceful and prosperous Okinawa.\"",
      "Okinawa remained under U.S. occupation from 1945 until the 1972 reversion to Japan. The U.S. military maintains a heavy presence there due to Okinawa\u2019s strategic importance for security in the Pacific. Their presence serves not only to help defend Japan but also for missions elsewhere, including in the South China Sea and the Middle East.",
      "Private properties were confiscated to build U.S. bases, and the base-dependent economy has hampered the growth of local industry.",
      "Fear of a Taiwan conflict rekindles bitter memories of the Battle of Okinawa. Historians and many residents say Okinawa was used as a pawn to save mainland Japan.",
      "There are also ancient tensions between Okinawa and the Japanese mainland, which annexed the islands, formerly the independent kingdom of the Ryukus, in 1879.",
      "Okinawa remains home to the majority of about 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan under a bilateral security pact. The island, which accounts for only 0.6% of Japanese land, hosts 70% of U.S. military facilities.",
      "Even 53 years after its reversion to Japan, Okinawa is burdened with the heavy U.S. presence and faces noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops, the governor said.",
      "Nearly 2,000 tons of unexploded U.S. bombs remain in Okinawa, with some regularly dug up. A recent explosion at a storage site at a U.S. military base caused minor injuries to four Japanese soldiers.",
      "Remains of hundreds of war dead are still unrecovered on Okinawa, as the government\u2019s search and identification effort is slow to make progress.",

      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has nominated a five-term liberal lawmaker as defense minister, breaking with a tradition of appointing retired military generals",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung nominated a five-term liberal lawmaker as defense minister Monday, breaking with a tradition of appointing retired military generals.",
      "The announcement came as several prominent former defense officials, including ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, face high-profile criminal trials over their roles in carrying out martial law last year under then-President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was indicted on rebellion charges and removed from office.",
      "Ahn Gyu-back, a lawmaker from Lee\u2019s Democratic Party, has served on the National Assembly\u2019s defense committee and chaired a legislative panel that investigated the circumstances surrounding Yoon\u2019s martial law decree.",
      "Yoon\u2019s authoritarian move involved deploying hundreds of heavily armed troops to the National Assembly and election commission offices in what prosecutors described as an illegal attempt to shut down the legislature and arrest political opponents and election officials.",
      "That sparked calls to strengthen civilian control over the military, and Lee promised during his election campaign to appoint a defense minister with a civilian background.",
      "Since a 1961 coup that brought military dictator Park Chung-hee to power, all of South Korea\u2019s defense ministers have come from the military \u2014 a trend that continued even after the country\u2019s democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "While Ahn will face a legislative hearing, the process is likely to be a formality, since the Democrats hold a comfortable majority in the National Assembly and legislative consent isn\u2019t required for Lee to appoint him. Among Cabinet appointments, Lee only needs legislative consent for prime minister, Seoul\u2019s nominal No. 2 job.",
      "\u201cAs the first civilian Minister of National Defense in 64 years, he will be responsible for leading and overseeing the transformation of the military after its mobilization in martial law,\u201d Kang Hoon-sik, Lee\u2019s chief of staff, said in a briefing.",
      "Ahn was among 11 ministers nominated by Lee on Monday, with longtime diplomat Cho Hyun selected as foreign minister and five-term lawmaker Chung Dong-young returning for another stint as unification minister \u2014 a position he held from 2004 to 2005 as Seoul\u2019s point man for relations with North Korea.",

      "Officials say Russian drones and missiles have killed at least 10 civilians in Ukraine in nighttime attacks",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian drones and missiles killed at least 10 civilians in Ukraine in nighttime attacks, local officials said Monday, with seven deaths reported in the capital, Kyiv, where emergency crews raced to find people believed trapped under the rubble of a partially collapsed apartment building.",
      "Russia fired 352 drones and decoys overnight, as well as 11 ballistic missiles and five cruise missiles, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Air defenses intercepted or jammed 339 drones and 15 missiles before they could reach their targets, a statement said.",
      "The strikes came nearly a week after a combined Russian attack on Ukraine last Tuesday killed 28 people in Kyiv, 23 of them in a residential building that collapsed after sustaining a direct missile hit.",
      "Russian forces have for several months been trying to drive deeper into Ukraine as part of a renewed summer push along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, though the Institute for the Study of War said their progress has been limited.",
      "\u201cRussian forces have failed to make significant gains during this period of intensified offensive operations, however, due in part to the fact that Russian forces are largely relying on poorly trained infantry to make gains in the face of Ukraine\u2019s drone-based defense,\u201d the Washington-based think tank said late Sunday.",
      "At the same time, Russia has pounded civilian areas with long-range strikes in an apparent attempt to weaken public morale.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said preliminary data indicated that Russian forces used North Korean missiles in the Kyiv strike. He called Russia, North Korea and Iran, which has provided drones to Russia, a \u201ccoalition of murderers\u201d and warned of a potential spread of the \u201cterror\u201d if their alliance continues.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s defense and new ways to pressure Russia will be the two main topics in his visit to the United Kingdom on Monday. Zelenskyy was to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London ahead of this week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Starmer\u2019s office said.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the latest strikes demonstrated Russia\u2019s \u201cunlimited cruelty,\u201d by deliberately taking aim at civilian targets, and promised more European sanctions on Moscow.",
      "Drones and missiles hit residential areas, hospitals and sports infrastructure in numerous districts across Kyiv in the early hours of Monday, emergency services said.",
      "The most severe damage was in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, where a section of a five-story apartment building collapsed.",
      "Six people were killed in that district, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ten others, including a pregnant woman, were rescued from a nearby high-rise that also sustained heavy damage in the blast.",
      "Dozens of vehicles, some burned out and others mangled by flying debris from the blast, formed a snarl in the courtyard in front of the partly demolished building, which had collapsed down to the second floor.",
      "Onlookers, some wrapped in blankets, watched tearfully as the cleanup operation took place. Dozens of volunteers worked to remove broken glass, downed tree branches and other debris.",
      "Oleksii Pozychaniuk, 29, who lives in the building next to the one struck in the attack, said he heard the whistle of the rocket approaching from inside his apartment and \u201cfroze in terror\u201d before feeling the impact.",
      "\u201cWindows burst out, glass was flying everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe barely made it downstairs with my child, everything here was on fire. We didn\u2019t see the neighboring building yet because everything was covered in smoke, the cars were smoldering, tires were bursting from the high temperature which was also scary.\u201d",
      "Klitschko told reporters that rescue workers were still searching the collapsed building for survivors.",
      "The Russian attack also damaged the entrance to the Sviatoshyn subway station in Kyiv, slightly injuring two people, said Timur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's military administration. He said more than 30 people were injured across the city.",
      "Since the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion, underground subway stations have served as shelters for those seeking protection from aerial attacks. During almost nightly strikes, stations across Kyiv are often filled with people waiting out the danger.",
      "Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian short-range drone attack killed two people and wounded 10 more in the Chernihiv region late Sunday night, authorities said. Three children were among the wounded, according to the regional administration head, Viacheslav Chaus.",
      "Another person was killed and eight wounded overnight in the city of Bila Tserkva, around 85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of the capital.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 23 Ukrainian drones overnight into Monday.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan condemned U.S. President Donald Trump for bombing Iran, less than 24 hours after saying he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for defusing a recent crisis with India.",
      "Relations between the two South Asian countries plummeted after a massacre of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir in April. The nuclear-armed rivals stepped closer to war in the weeks that followed, attacking each other until intense diplomatic efforts, led by the U.S., resulted in a truce for which Trump took credit.",
      "It was this \u201cdecisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership\u201d that Pakistan praised in an effusive message Saturday night on the X platform when it announced its formal recommendation for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Less than 24 hours later, however, it condemned the U.S. for attacking Iran, saying the strikes \u201cconstituted a serious violation of international law\u201d and the statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a phone call Sunday with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressed his concern that the bombings had targeted facilities that were under the safeguards of the IAEA.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump and his NATO counterparts are gathering this week for what might be a historic summit",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- U.S. President Donald Trump and his NATO counterparts are due to gather Tuesday for a summit that could unite the world's biggest security organization around a new defense spending pledge or widen divisions among the 32 allies.",
      "Just a week ago, things had seemed rosy. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was optimistic the European members and Canada would commit to invest at least as much of their economic growth on defense as the United States does for the first time.",
      "Then Spain rejected the new NATO target for each country to spend 5% of its gross domestic product on defense needs, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Trump also insists on that figure. The alliance operates on a consensus that requires the backing of all 32 members.",
      "The following day, Trump said the U.S. should not have to respect the goal.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should, but I think they should,\u201d he said. Trump lashed out at Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government, saying: \u201cNATO is going to have to deal with Spain. Spain\u2019s been a very low payer.\" He also criticized Canada as \u201ca low payer.\u201d",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure, while Canada was spending 1.45%, according to NATO figures.",
      "Then Trump ordered the bombing of nuclear installations in Iran. In 2003, the U.S.-led war on Iraq deeply divided NATO, as France and Germany led opposition to the attack, while Britain and Spain joined the coalition.",
      "European allies and Canada also want Ukraine to be at the top of the summit agenda, but they are wary that Trump might not want President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to steal the limelight.",
      "The two-day summit in The Hague involves an informal dinner Tuesday and one working session Wednesday morning. A very short summit statement has been drafted to ensure the meeting is not derailed by fights over details and wording.",
      "Indeed, much about this NATO summit is brief, even though ripples could be felt for years.",
      "Founded in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed by 12 nations to counter the threat to security in Europe posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, notably via a strong U.S. presence on the continent.",
      "Dealing with Moscow is in its DNA. Keeping the peace outside the Euro-Atlantic area is not.",
      "NATO\u2019s ranks have grown to 32 countries since the Washington Treaty was signed 75 years ago. Sweden joined last year, worried by an increasingly aggressive Russia.",
      "NATO\u2019s collective security guarantee \u2014 Article 5 of the treaty \u2014 underpins its credibility.",
      "It\u2019s a political commitment by all countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. Trump has suggested he is committed to that pledge, but he has also sowed doubt about his intentions. He has said the U.S. intends to remain a member of the alliance.",
      "The United States is NATO\u2019s most powerful member. It spends much more on defense than any other ally and far outweighs its partners in terms of military muscle. Washington has traditionally driven the agenda but has stepped back under Trump.",
      "The U.S. nuclear arsenal provides strategic deterrence against would-be adversaries.",
      "NATO\u2019s day-to-day work is led by Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister.",
      "As its top civilian official, he chairs almost weekly meetings of ambassadors in the North Atlantic Council at its Brussels headquarters. He chairs other \u201cNACs\u201d at ministerial and leader levels. Rutte runs NATO headquarters, trying to foster consensus and to speak on behalf of all members.",
      "NATO\u2019s military headquarters is based nearby in Mons, Belgium. It is always run by a top U.S. officer.",
      "With Trump demanding greater defense spending, it\u2019s unclear what role Ukraine will play at the summit. Zelenskyy has been invited, but it's unclear whether he will have a seat at NATO\u2019s table, although he may take part in Tuesday's dinner. Russia's war in Ukraine usually dominates such meetings.",
      "More broadly, NATO itself is not arming Ukraine. As an organization, it possesses no weapons of any kind. Collectively, it provides only non-lethal support \u2014 fuel, combat rations, medical supplies, body armor, and equipment to counter drones or mines.",
      "But individually, members do send arms. European allies provided 60% of the military support that Ukraine received in 2024. NATO coordinates those weapons deliveries via a hub on the Polish border and helps organize training for Ukrainian troops.",
      "A key part of the commitment for allies to defend one another is to deter Russia, or any other adversary, from attacking in the first place. Finland and Sweden joined NATO recently because of this concern.",
      "Under NATO\u2019s new military plans, 300,000 military personnel would be deployed within 30 days to counter any attack, whether it be on land, at sea, by air or in cyberspace. But experts doubt whether the allies could muster the troop numbers.",
      "It\u2019s not just about troop and equipment numbers. An adversary would be less likely to challenge NATO if it thought the allies would use the forces it controls. Trump\u2019s threats against U.S. allies \u2014 including imposing tariffs on them \u2014 has weakened that deterrence.",
      "Due to high U.S. defense spending over many years, the American armed forces have more personnel and superior weapons but also significant transportation and logistics assets.",
      "Other allies are starting to spend more, though. After years of cuts, NATO members committed to ramp up their national defense budgets in 2014 when Russia illegally annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the NATO allies agreed to make 2% of GDP the minimum spending level. Last year, 22 countries were expected to hit that target, up from only three a decade ago.",
      "In The Hague, the allies were expected to up the ante to 3.5%, plus a further 1.5% for things like improving roads, bridges, ports and airfields or preparing societies to deal with future conflicts. Whether they will now remains an open question.",

      "Belarusian dissident Siarhei Tsihanouski says he was held in solitary confinement, in conditions similar to torture, during five years in prison",
      "VILNIUS, Lithuania -- Siarhei Tsikhanouski is almost unrecognizable. Belarus' key opposition figure, imprisoned in 2020 and unexpectedly released on Saturday, once weighed 135 kilograms (298 pounds) at 1.92 meters (nearly 6\u20194\u201d) tall, but now is at just 79 kilos (174 pounds).",
      "On Saturday, Tsikhanouski was freed alongside 13 other prisoners and brought to Vilnius, the capital of neighboring Lithuania, where he was reunited with his wife, exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, and their children. Speaking to The Associated Press the day after, Tsikhanouski tries to smile and joke, but struggles to hold back heavy sighs recalling what he endured behind bars.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely torture,\u201d Tsikhanouski told The Associated Press in the first sit-down interview since his release. Prison officials \u201ckept telling me: \u2018You will be here not just for the 20 years we\u2019ve already given you.\u2019 We will convict you again,'\" he said. \"They told me that 'You would never get out.' And they kept repeating: \u2018You will die here.\u2019\u201d",
      "One of Belarus\u2019s most prominent opposition figures, Tsikhanouski said he \u201calmost forgot how to speak\u201d during his years in solitary confinement. He was held in complete isolation, denied medical care, and given barely enough food.",
      "\u201cIf you had seen me when they threw only two spoons of porridge onto my plate, two small spoons \u2026\u201d he said, adding that he couldn't buy anything anything in the prison kiosk. \u201cThey would sometimes give me a little tube of toothpaste, a little piece of soap as charity. Sometimes they would, sometimes they wouldn\u2019t.\"",
      "Now 46, Tsikhanouski, a popular blogger and activist, was freed just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Keith Kellogg became the highest-ranking U.S. official in years to visit Belarus, Moscow\u2019s close and dependent ally.",
      "Tsikhanouski, known for his anti-Lukashenko slogan \u201cstop the cockroach,\u201d was arrested after announcing plans to challenge the strongman in the 2020 election and shortly before the campaign began. He was sentenced to 19 years and six months on charges widely seen as politically motivated. His wife ran in his stead, rallying crowds across the country. Official results handed Lukashenko his sixth term in office but were denounced by the opposition and the West as a sham.",
      "Lukashenko has since tightened his grip, securing a seventh term in disputed January 2025 elections. Since mid-2024, his government has pardoned nearly 300 prisoners \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 in what analysts see as an attempt to mend ties with the West.",
      "Tsikhanouski credited U.S. President Donald Trump with aiding his release.",
      "\u201cI thank Donald Trump endlessly,\u201d Tsikhanouski said. \u201cThey (the Belarusian authorities) want Trump to at least, a little bit, somewhere, to meet them halfway. They are ready to release them all. All of them!\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets in the aftermath of the August 2020 vote. Thousands were detained, many beaten by police. Prominent opposition figures either fled the country or were imprisoned.",
      "At least 1,177 political prisoners remain in custody, according to Viasna, the oldest and most prominent human rights group in Belarus. Among them is Viasna\u2019s founder, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski.",
      "Also behind bars are Viktor Babaryka, a former banker who was widely seen in 2020 as Lukashenko\u2019s main electoral rival, and Maria Kolesnikova, a close ally of Tsikhanouskaya and charismatic leader of that year\u2019s mass protests.",
      "Tsikhanouski called his release \u201ca dream that\u2019s still hard to believe.\u201d On Saturday, he said, guards removed him from a KGB pretrial detention center, put a black bag over his head, and handcuffed him before transporting him in a minibus. He and other prisoners had no idea where they were going.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I still can\u2019t believe it. I was afraid I\u2019d wake up and everything would still be the same. I don\u2019t believe it, I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said, pausing frequently and wiping away tears.",
      "Tsikhanouski\u2019s children \u2014 his daughter, aged 9, and 15-year-old son \u2014 didn\u2019t recognize him when they were reunited.",
      "\u201cWe came in and my wife said to my daughter, \u2018Your dad has arrived,\u2019\u201d he said, crying. \u201cAt first she couldn\u2019t understand, and then she rushed in \u2014 she was crying, I was crying ... for a very long time. My son too! These are emotions that cannot be described.\u201d",
      "Tsikhanouski, who says his health has deteriorated behind bars, plans to undergo a medical examination in Lithuania. He says cold and hunger were \u201cthe main causes of illness\u201d that affected nearly all political prisoners in Belarus, who were subjected to \u201cespecially harsh conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were skin diseases, and everyone had kidney problems from the cold \u2014 and no one really understood what was happening,\u201d Tsikhanouski said. \u201cBlood came out of my mouth, from my nose. Sometimes I had convulsions \u2014 but it was all because of the cold, that terrible cold when you sit in those punishment cells.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no medical care in prison \u2014 none at all, just so you know \u2026\u201d he said.",
      "Tsikhanouski said conditions slightly improved after the February 2024 death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a prison colony.",
      "\u201cWhen Alexei Navalny died, I thought, that\u2019ll probably be me soon \u2026 And then something changed. It was clear that someone at the top said, \u2018Make sure he doesn\u2019t die here. We don\u2019t need that problem.\u2019 It got just a bit softer ... At some point, word came down: Tsikhanouski must be kept alive, not killed.\u201d",
      "Tsikhanouski blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for propping up Lukashenko, both during the 2020 protests and to this day.",
      "Russia supports Belarus\u2019s economy with loans and subsidized oil and gas. In return, Belarus has allowed Moscow to use its territory to launch troops and weapons into Ukraine, and hosts Russian forces and nuclear weapons.",
      "Tsikhanouski expressed strong support for Ukraine, calling the Kremlin a common evil for both countries.",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Putin, we would already be living in a different country. Putin recognized Lukashenko\u2019s victory in the election, he called black white. That is, he refused to see the falsifications,\u201d Tsikhanouski said. \u201cThey help each other. Because of Putin, this illegal government is still in Belarus.\u201d",
      "Some analysts have speculated that by releasing the charismatic and energetic Tsikhanouski, Belarusian authorities may be trying to sow division within the opposition. But Tsikhanouski insists he has no intention of challenging his wife's role as the internationally recognized head of the Belarusian opposition, and he calls for unity.",
      "\u201cUnder no circumstances do I plan to criticize any Belarusians, condemn or complain about anyone,\" he said.",
      "Tsikhanouski says he will not stop fighting and wants to return to active work as both a political figure and a blogger. But he is skeptical that Lukashenko, now 70, will step down voluntarily, despite his age.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore \u2014 will he go or won\u2019t he?\u201d Tsikhanouski said. \u201cMany people say nothing will change until he dies. But I\u2019m still counting on democratic forces winning.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It was an unprecedented attack years in the making, with some last-minute misdirection meant to give the operation a powerful element of surprise",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- It was an unprecedented attack years in the making, with some last-minute misdirection meant to give the operation a powerful element of surprise.",
      "U.S. pilots dropped 30,000-pound bombs early Sunday on two key underground uranium enrichment plants in Iran, delivering what American military leaders believe is a knockout blow to a nuclear program that Israel views as an existential threat and has been pummeling for more than a week. American sailors bolstered the surprise mission by firing dozens of cruise missiles from a submarine toward at least one other site.",
      "Dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, U.S. officials say the plan was characterized by a \u201cprecision strike\u201d that \u201cdevastated the Iranian nuclear program,\u201d even as they acknowledged an assessment was ongoing. For its part, Iran denied that any significant damage had been done, and the Islamic Republic pledged to retaliate.",
      "Taking off from the U.S. heartland, B-2 stealth bombers delivered a total of 420,000 pounds of explosives, aided by an armada of refueling tankers and fighter jets \u2014 some of which launched their own weapons. U.S. officials said Iran neither detected the inbound fusillade, nor mustered a shot at the stealthy American jets.",
      "The operation relied on a series of deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain the secrecy, U.S. officials said hours after the attack, which was preceded by nine days of Israeli attacks that debilitated Iran's military leadership and air defenses.",
      "Even before the planes took off, elements of misdirection were already in play. After setting parts of the plan in motion, Trump publicly announced Thursday that he\u2019d make a decision within two weeks on whether to strike Iran \u2014 ostensibly to allow additional time for negotiations, but in actuality masking the impending attack.",
      "One group of B-2 stealth bombers traveled west from Missouri on Saturday as decoys, drawing the attention of amateur plane spotters, government officials and some media as they headed toward a U.S. air base in the Pacific. At the same time, seven other B-2s carrying two \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs apiece flew eastward, keeping communications to a minimum so as not to draw any attention.",
      "Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at Sunday's briefing that it was all \"part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise\u201d and that only \u201can extremely small number of planners and key leaders\u201d knew about it in Washington and Florida, where U.S. Central Command is based.",
      "After 18 hours of furtive flying that required aerial refueling, the armed B-2 Spirit bombers, each with two crew members, arrived on time and without detection in the Eastern Mediterranean, from where they launched their attack runs. Before crossing into Iran, the B-2s were escorted by stealthy U.S. fighter jets and reconnaissance aircraft.",
      "A graphic released by the Pentagon showed the flight route as passing over Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. It was unclear whether those countries were notified of the U.S. overflight in advance. Most U.S. lawmakers were also kept in the dark, with some Republicans saying they were provided a brief heads-up by the White House before the strike.",
      "\u201cOur B-2s went in and out and back without the world knowing at all,\u201d Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told reporters Sunday.",
      "About an hour before the B-2s entered Iran, Caine said that a U.S. submarine in the region launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key targets, including a site in Isfahan where uranium is prepared for enrichment.",
      "As the U.S. bombers approached their targets, they watched out for Iranian fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles, but encountered none.",
      "At 6:40 p.m. in Washington and 2:10 a.m. in Tehran, the first B-2 bomber dropped its pair of GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrators on the deeply buried Fordo uranium enrichment plant. It was the first time these so-called \u201cbunker busters\u201d had ever been used in combat. Each 30,000-pound bomb is designed to burrow into the ground before detonating a massive warhead.",
      "The Fordo site received the bulk of the bombardment, though a couple of the enormous bombs were also dropped on a uranium enrichment site at Natanz.",
      "The U.S. bombs fell for about half an hour, with cruise missiles fired from submarines being the last American weapons to hit their targets, which included a third nuclear site at Isfahan, Caine said.",
      "Both Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog said there were no immediate signs of radioactive contamination around the sites.",
      "The mission included:",
      "\u2014 75 precision-guided weapons: these included 14 GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs deployed by the seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, and more than two-dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a U.S. submarine.",
      "\u2014 125 aircraft, including the B-2 bombers, fighter jets and refueling planes.",
      "Hegseth said Sunday that \u201cour boys in those bombers are on their way home right now.\u201d",
      "But a U.S. official said one woman was among those piloting the B-2 bombers. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the mission publicly.",
      "Caine said the use of the bunker-buster bombs made the mission historic, as did other elements.",
      "\u201cThis was the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history, and the second longest B-2 mission ever flown, exceeded only by those in the days following 9/11,\" he told reporters Sunday.",

They have cut ties with the traditional Western allies, ousting French and American military forces, and instead sought new security ties with Russia.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes edged higher in May, as stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "Existing home sales rose 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.",
      "Sales fell 0.7% compared with May last year. The latest home sales fell topped the 3.95 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "\u201cThe sluggish sales activity one can attribute essentially to affordability,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 23rd consecutive month, although the rate of growth continued to slow. The national median sales price rose 1.3% in May from a year earlier to $422,800, an all-time high for the month of May.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a slump since early 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Home sales fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The low point for this year arrived five weeks ago, when the average rate briefly dropped to 6.62%. Last week, it averaged 6.81%.",
      "Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in April and May, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.62% to 6.89%.",
      "High mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, remain a key affordability hurdle for many would-be homebuyers. Years of soaring home prices have helped put homeownership out of reach. The median U.S. home sales price is up 52% since May 2019, while the U.S. median annual income has risen 30% in the same period, Yun noted.",
      "While price growth has slowed, elevated mortgage rates and rising prices are forcing prospective homebuyers to save more for a down payment. In May, buyers needed an annual income of $91,960 to afford a typical home with a 20% down payment, or nearly 87% more than in May 2019, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates benefited from a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "There were 1.54 million unsold homes at the end of last month, a 6.2% increase from April, and 20.3% higher than May last year, NAR said. That\u2019s still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic, however.",
      "May\u2019s month-end inventory translates to a 4.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 4.4-month pace at the end of April and 3.8 months in May last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",

      "Real estate brokerage company Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow over its policy to ban private home listings.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Compass claims that \u201cZillow has sought to rely on anticompetitive tactics to protect its monopoly and revenues in violation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Compass says that Zillow has implemented an exclusionary policy that says if a home seller and their real estate agent market their property off Zillow for more than one day, that Zillow and its allies, Redfin and eXp Realty, will ban that home from being listed on their search platforms.",
      "\u201cThe Zillow Ban seeks to ensure that all home listings in this country are steered on to its dominant search platform so Zillow can monetize each home listing and protect its monopoly,\u201d Compass said in the lawsuit.",
      "Compass alleges that the \u2018Zillow Ban\u2019 was enacted to prevent rivals from competing against it and reduces homeowner choice.",
      "\u201cIn a free and competitive market, competitors\u2019 products and strategies should rise and fall on merit\u2014not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\u201d Compass said.",
      "Compass wants an injunction that would prohibit Zillow from implementing and enforcing its \u2018Zillow Ban\u2019 and implementing and enforcing similar policies. The company also wants a trial by jury and an unspecified amount in damages.",
      "A Zillow spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that the company believes the claims in the lawsuit are unfounded and that it will vigorously defend against them.",
      "\"Our focus remains on creating a level playing field that serves the best interests of everyone in the home buying and selling journey,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The housing market is always competitive, but has become more fierce of late. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.",
      "Existing home sales dropped 0.5% in April, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. The sales decline marked the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis. March\u2019s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.",
      "Sales of existing homes barely moved in May, with existing home sales up 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "There's also been the issue of more sellers than homebuyers, with potential buyers skittish over high prices and mortgage rates. As of April, the U.S. housing market had nearly 34% more sellers than buyers shopping for a home, according to an analysis by Redfin.",
      "Aside from April 2020, when the pandemic brought the economy and home sales activity to a standstill, there haven\u2019t been this few buyers in the market for a home before, based on records that date back to 2013.",

      "The move, issued by royal decree, is a first among the six-member oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council. However, the 5% tax won\u2019t be imposed until 2028. Only those who make upward of $109,000 annually \u2014 the top 1% of earners in Oman \u2014 will be required to pay it, the Gulf state said.",

      "The lack of income tax so far has been a boon for development in the Gulf, helping to attract migrant workers to the region.",
      "But for Oman, the introduction of the income tax \u201cwill further prioritize financial stability by diversifying revenue sources\u201d that will help shelter the country from \u201cfluctuations\u201d in the global energy market, Minister of Economy Said bin Mohammed Al-Saqri said",
      "He added that oil and gas revenues can account for up to 85% of the nation\u2019s public income, depending on the market.",
      "\"The tax serves as a new revenue stream to diversify public income sources and mitigate risks associated with reliance on oil as the primary revenue source,\" Al-Saqri said.",
      "Oman has been weighing the personal income tax for several years, and its introduction follows other fiscal reforms. In 2020, it rolled out a program to cut down public debt and boost economic development. The move, Al-Saqri said, is part of Oman\u2019s broader Vision 2040 project, which hopes to turn the country into a technology-based economy.",

      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",

Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",

      "Global markets appear to have taken the U.S. strike against nuclear targets in Iran in stride as investors await next moves by Iran",
      "BANGKOK -- Global markets appeared to take the U.S. strike against nuclear targets in Iran in stride as investors watched Monday to see how Iran will react.",
      "The price of oil initially jumped more than 2%, fell and then regained about half that much. U.S. stock futures edged lower and share benchmarks in Europe and Asia also were mostly lower.",
      "The attacks on three Iranian sites raised the stakes in the war between Israel and Iran and left questions about what remains of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. It also increased the possibility that Iran might retaliate, potentially disrupting shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which much of the world\u2019s crude oil passes.",
      "The big unknown is what Iran will do, analysts said.",
      "The price of Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 1.2% at $77.91 per barrel. U.S. benchmark crude climbed 1.3% to $74.79.",
      "The future for the S&P 500 was little changed, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%. Treasury yields were steady.",
      "In Europe, Germany's DAX lost 0.5% to 23,230.54 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.6% to 7,541.25. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2% to 8,761.53.",
      "Overall, there was no sign of panic.",
      "\u201cI believe what we are thinking is or the thinking is that it is going to be a short conflict. The one big hit by the Americans will be effective and then we\u2019ll get back to sort of business as usual, in which case there is no need for an immediate, panicky type of reaction,\u201d said Neil Newman, managing director of Atris Advisory Japan.",
      "The conflict began with an Israeli attack against Iran on June 13 that sent oil prices yo-yoing and rattled other markets.",
      "Closing off the Strait of Hormuz would be technically difficult but it could severely disrupt transit through it, sending insurance rates spiking and making shippers nervous to move without U.S. Navy escorts. As a major oil producer, Iran may be reluctant to close down the waterway, which is used to transport its own crude, mostly to China. Oil is a major revenue source for the regime.",
      "\u201cThe situation remains highly fluid, and much hinges on whether Tehran opts for a restrained reaction or a more aggressive course of action,\u201d Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a commentary.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said disrupting traffic through the strait would be \u201ceconomic suicide\" and would elicit a U.S. response.",
      "\"I would encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "When asked about that at a routine briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing that \u201cChina is willing to strengthen communication with Iran and relevant parties to continue playing a constructive role in promoting de-escalation\" of the conflict.",
      "\"The Persian Gulf and its adjacent waters are important international channels for cargo and energy trade. Maintaining security and stability in this region serves the common interests of the international community,\" he said.",
      "Tom Kloza, chief market analyst at Turner Mason & Co said he expects Iranian leaders to refrain from drastic measures and oil futures to ease back after the initial fears blow over.",
      "Disrupting shipping would be \" a scorched earth possibility, a Sherman-burning-Atlanta move,\u201d Kloza said.",
      "Writing in a report, Ed Yardeni, a long-time analyst, agreed that Tehran leaders would likely hold back.",
      "\u201cThey aren\u2019t crazy,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors Sunday. \u201cThe price of oil should fall and stock markets around the world should climb higher.\u201d",
      "Other experts weren't so sure.",
      "Countries are not always rational actors and Tehran could lash out for political or emotional reasons, said Andy Lipow, a Houston analyst who has covered oil markets for 45 years.",
      "\u201cIf the Strait of Hormuz was completely shut down, oil prices would rise to $120 to $130 a barrel,\u201d Lipow said. That would translate to about $4.50 a gallon at the pump and hurt consumers in other ways, he said.",
      "Much of East Asia depends on oil imported through the strait. Taiwan's Taiex fell 1.4% while the Kospi in South Korea slipped 0.2%.",
      "In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower, with gains for defense contractors, oil companies and miners helping to make up for broad losses.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. strike on Iran certainly is very good for defense equipment,\u201d Newman of Atris Advisory said, noting that both Japan and South Korea have sizable military manufacturing hubs.",
      "Australia's S&P/ASX fell 0.4%.",
      "Hong Kong's Hang Seng regained lost ground, climbing 0.7%, while the Shanghai Composite index picked up 0.7%.",
      "In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar rose to 147.82 Japanese yen from 146.66 yen. The euro fell to $1.1464 from $1.1473.",

      "A new play by MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d recipient Taylor Mac invites questions about the moral value of philanthropy in a society denounced by the comedy as \u201cfeudal.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Mac does not set out to bite the hand that feeds in a new play satirizing cultural philanthropy. The MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d recipient claims to be \u201cjust trying to get some lipstick on it.\"",
      "Set at a not-for-profit dance company\u2019s gala, \"Prosperous Fools\" invites questions about the moral value of philanthropy in a society denounced by the comedy as \u201cfeudal.\u201d A boorish patron goes mad trying vainly to wield his lacking creative capital and thus confirms the choreographer's fears of selling out to a sleazy oligarch who represents everything his art opposes. The show, written by Mac and directed by Darko Tresnjak, runs through June 29 at Brooklyn's Polonsky Shakespeare Center.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt anybody. I\u2019m trying to get people to think differently about the world,\u201d said Mac, whose gender pronoun is \u201cjudy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just wish that all of the great philanthropists of America, and the world, would lead with, \u2018This is a temporary solution until we can figure out how to make a government of the people, for the people, by the people,'\" Mac added. \"Instead of, \u2018This is the solution: I should have all the money and then I get to decide how the world works.\u2019\u201d",
      "Don't let present day parallels distract you. The fundraiser's honored donor enters atop a fire-breathing bald eagle in a black graphic tee, blazer and cap much like Elon Musk's signature White House getup. He later dons the long red tie popular in MAGA world. But the resemblance doesn't mean Mac is meditating solely on recent events such as President Donald Trump's billionaire-filled administration and tightening grip over cultural pillars including the Kennedy Center.",
      "The script reflects personal frustrations with philanthropy\u2019s uneven power dynamics navigated throughout a 30-year career spent in what Mac described as \u201ca million handshaking ceremonies,\" first as a cater-waiter and eventually as one of the celebrated honorees who donates performances to help fundraise.",
      "Mac\u2019s desperate portrayal of the artist at the center of \u201cProsperous Fools\u201d only sharpens its skewering of wealthy philanthropists who take more than they give away. When the artist cries \u201cBut why couldn\u2019t I have a good oligarch?\u201d and bemoans that \u201cI should have stayed in the artistic integrity of obscurity,\u201d it feels like a case of art imitating life.",
      "Mainstream success came last decade for Mac. \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music\u201d was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2017 and Mac's Broadway debut play \u201cGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\u201d racked up seven Tony nominations in 2019.",
      "\u201cProsperous Fools,\u201d however, was written 12 years ago before much of the critical acclaim. Mac said \u201csomeone with power\u201d commissioned a translation of French playwright Moli\u00e8re\u2019s \u201cLe Bourgeois Gentilhomme,\u201d which mocks a status-obsessed middle class social climber.",
      "Mac isn't surprised the original commissioner didn't want the final product. Moli\u00e8re is hardly present. And the play essentially advocates for an end to the perpetuation of culture that only the affluent deem worthy of funding.",
      "Mac is also unsurprised it took over a decade to land another interested producer. The initial 40-person ballet troupe had to be shrunk to a more affordable ensemble of four dancers. Plus, its style, in Mac's judgment, is still rather \u201cqueer\u201d for a \u201cheteronormative\u201d theater industry.",
      "\u201cAnd then the other reason is because I insult donors,\" Mac said.",
      "\u201cI don't think I insult donors,\" Mac added. \"I ask donors to consider. And the theater is entrenched in making sure their donors feel good about themselves \u2014 not that their donors are in collaboration with us for us all to get to a place of better consciousness.\u201d",
      "The show's slapstick humor helps break down its fairly cerebral subject matter. In one of several moments of hilarity, the patron and his \u201cphilanthropoid\u201d \u2014 the ballet's artistic director, whose primary concern is securing donations \u2014 sway around the stage oinking like pigs. Mac's artist delivers scathing and highbrow critiques while pretending to be \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d actor Wallace Shawn in a puppet costume. The gala's other honoree \u2014 a star singer called the \u201cpatron saint of philanthropy\" who wears a gown adorned with impoverished children's faces \u2014 makes no bones about her lust for Shawn.",
      "But, as Mac knows, nonstop humor can have the effect of softening its target. \u201cProsperous Fools\u201d foregoes the actors' bows that typically end a play in favor of an epilogue, delivered by the artist in rhyming couplets, that serves as the show's final blow to \u201cphilanthrocapitalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to be a tender heart in this too tough world trying to figure out how to maintain my tenderness and how to create revolution with tenderness. And I\u2019m at a loss for it right now,\" Mac said. \"Part of what the play is doing is saying, \u2018I\u2019m at a loss. Are you? Do you have a solution for me?\u2019\u201d",
      "By skipping the curtain call, Mac practically demands that the crowd wrestle immediately with whether charity absolves wealth hoarders' greed \u2014 a question boldly put forth at the close of a Theatre for a New Audience season sponsored by Deloitte and Bloomberg Philanthropies.",
      "But whether the show's heavy-handed message has reached those financial backers remains to be seen. \u201cNo one's spoken to me,\" Mac said. Neither responded to requests for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, \u201cThe @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!\u201d",
      "The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small \u2014 just 10 or 12 vehicles \u2014 and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area.",
      "Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard's ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard's legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard's ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.",
      "Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students \u2014 about a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.",
      "The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House\u2019s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government's action hours after Harvard sued.",
      "Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump's proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.",
      "\u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. \u201cOur Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.\u201d",
      "The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America's oldest and wealthiest university.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.",
      "Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they\u2019ll be able to attend the university.",
      "For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn't refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration's policies, she still hasn't heard back.",
      "\u201cYour personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,\u201d Huang said in a social media post. \u201cWhy does it have to be so hard to go to school?\u201d",
      "Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address \u201ctheir largescale improprieties\" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. \u201cThey have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\u201d Trump's post said.",
      "Trump's administration first targeted Harvard's international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard\u2019s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world\u2019s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard\u2019s reputation as a global research hub. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard\u2019s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",

      "A judge could decide Friday whether to advance OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids will go before a judge Friday, potentially setting up votes on whether to accept it for local governments, people who became addicted to the drug and other groups.",
      "This month, 49 states announced they have signed on to the the proposal. Only Oklahoma, which has a separate settlement with the company, is not involved.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane could decide as soon as Friday whether to advance the nationwide settlement, which was hammered out in negotiations between the company, groups that have sued and representatives of members of the Sackler family who own the company.",
      "If Lane moves the plan forward as it's been presented, government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal.",
      "The settlement is a way to avoid trials with claims from states alone that total more than $2 trillion in damages.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper to protect members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "In the new version, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payments would not begin until after a hearing, likely in November, during which Judge Lane would be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters",
      "LONDON -- Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters.",
      "Deezer, based in Paris, is grappling with a surge in music on its platform created using artificial intelligence tools it says are being wielded to earn royalties fraudulently.",
      "The app will display an on-screen label warning about \u201cAI-generated content\" and notify listeners that some tracks on an album were created with song generators.",
      "Deezer is a small player in music streaming, which is dominated by Spotify, Amazon and Apple, but the company said AI-generated music is an \u201cindustry-wide issue.\u201d It's committed to \u201csafeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favor of training AI models,\" CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a press release.",
      "Deezer's move underscores the disruption caused by generative AI systems, which are trained on the contents of the internet including text, images and audio available online. AI companies are facing a slew of lawsuits challenging their practice of scraping the web for such training data without paying for it.",
      "According to an AI song detection tool that Deezer rolled out this year, 18% of songs uploaded to its platform each day, or about 20,000 tracks, are now completely AI generated. Just three months earlier, that number was 10%, Lanternier said in a recent interview.",
      "AI has many benefits but it also \"creates a lot of questions\" for the music industry, Lanternier told The Associated Press. Using AI to make music is fine as long as there's an artist behind it but the problem arises when anyone, or even a bot, can use it to make music, he said.",
      "Music fraudsters \u201ccreate tons of songs. They upload, they try to get on playlists or recommendations, and as a result they gather royalties,\u201d he said.",
      "Musicians can't upload music directly to Deezer or rival platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. Music labels or digital distribution platforms can do it for artists they have contracts with, while anyone else can use a \u201cself service\u201d distribution company.",
      "Fully AI-generated music still accounts for only about 0.5% of total streams on Deezer. But the company said it's \u201cevident\" that fraud is \u201cthe primary purpose\" for these songs because it suspects that as many as seven in 10 listens of an AI song are done by streaming \"farms\" or bots, instead of humans.",
      "Any AI songs used for \u201cstream manipulation\u201d will be cut off from royalty payments, Deezer said.",
      "AI has been a hot topic in the music industry, with debates swirling around its creative possibilities as well as concerns about its legality.",
      "Two of the most popular AI song generators, Suno and Udio, are being sued by record companies for copyright infringement, and face allegations they exploited recorded works of artists from Chuck Berry to Mariah Carey.",
      "Gema, a German royalty-collection group, is suing Suno in a similar case filed in Munich, accusing the service of generating songs that are \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to original versions by artists it represents, including \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville, \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d by Boney M and Lou Bega's \u201cMambo No. 5.\u201d",
      "Major record labels are reportedly negotiating with Suno and Udio for compensation, according to news reports earlier this month.",
      "To detect songs for tagging, Lanternier says Deezer uses the same generators used to create songs to analyze their output.",
      "\u201cWe identify patterns because the song creates such a complex signal. There is lots of information in the song,\u201d Lanternier said.",
      "The AI music generators seem to be unable to produce songs without subtle but recognizable patterns, which change constantly.",
      "\u201cSo you have to update your tool every day,\" Lanternier said. \"So we keep generating songs to learn, to teach our algorithm. So we\u2019re fighting AI with AI.\u201d",
      "Fraudsters can earn big money through streaming. Lanternier pointed to a criminal case last year in the U.S., which authorities said was the first ever involving artificially inflated music streaming. Prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud conspiracy, accusing him of generating hundreds of thousands of AI songs and using bots to automatically stream them billions of times, earning at least $10 million.",

      "North Carolina legislators have finalized a bill that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.",
      "With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law's requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law's directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.",
      "The bill's Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state's dominant electric utility.",
      "The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state\u2019s clean-energy economy. His office didn't immediately provide comment after Thursday's vote.",
      "With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "The legislation came about as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.",
      "Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.",
      "\u201cOur residents shouldn\u2019t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,\u201d Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.",
      "Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.",
      "Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.",
      "Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.",
      "\u201cThis bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they\u2019re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.",
      "Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,\u201d the company said this week.",

      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don\u2019t support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips",
      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid.",
      "The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a huge hole in this concept of \u2018no tax on tips\u2019 because a lot of restaurant workers aren\u2019t receiving tips in the first place,\u201d said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.\u201d",
      "For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.",
      "The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that \u201ccash tips\u201d qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement.",
      "Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn\u2019t respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s.",
      "The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.",
      "But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal leaves out too many of those workers.",
      "The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers\u2019 bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.",
      "Skandalos tried pooling servers\u2019 tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn\u2019t understand and kept tipping.",
      "Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.",
      "Skandalos said \u201cno tax on tips\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people\u2019s pocketbooks, but now let\u2019s finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.",
      "\u201c\u2019No tax on tips\u2019 is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,\u201d he said.",
      "Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour.",
      "Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford\u2019s bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they\u2019re inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it.",
      "For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay.",
      "\u201cI think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,\u201d she said.",

      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in a letter sent on Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.",
      "Most U.S. allies in NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "A NATO official on Thursday said that discussions between allies were ongoing about a new defense spending plan.",
      "\u201cFor Spain, committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive, as it would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the EU\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said in April that the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "On Thursday, S\u00e1nchez called for \u201ca more flexible formula\u201d in relation to a new spending target \u2014 one that either made it optional or left Spain out of its application.",
      "S\u00e1nchez wrote that the country is \u201cfully committed to NATO,\" but that meeting a 5% target \u201cwould be incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.\" He said that doing so would require cutting public services and scaling back other spending, including toward the green transition.",
      "Instead, Spain will need to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet the Spanish military\u2019s estimated defense needs, S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "At home, corruption scandals that have ensnared S\u00e1nchez's inner circle and family members have put the Spanish leader under increasing pressure to call an early election, even from some allies. In April, when S\u00e1nchez announced that Spain would reach NATO's previous 2% spending target, the move angered some coalition members further to the left of his Socialist Party.",
      "NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on military expenditure after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. But the alliance's plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investments of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "But Spain isn't alone among NATO's low spenders. Belgium, Canada and Italy will also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will be given to reach an agreed-upon new spending goal.",
      "A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are \u201dslowing down but not collapsing,\u201d according to a Bain & Co. consultancy study released Thursday.",
      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",
      "\u201cStill, to be positive in a difficult moment \u2014 with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever \u2014 it\u2019s not a market in collapse,\u2019\u2019 said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D\u2019Arpizio. \u201cIt is slowing down but not collapsing.\u201d",
      "Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags.",
      "Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence.",
      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",
      "Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands \u2014 Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta \u2014 are launching new creative directors.",
      "Kering\u2019s stock surged 12% on news of the appointment. D\u2019Arpizio underlined his track record, returning French carmaker Renault to profitability and previous roles as marketing director at Volkswagen and Fiat.",
      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",
      "With aesthetic changes afoot \u201cstuffing the channels doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said.",
      "Still, many of the headwinds buffering the sector are out of companies\u2019 control.",
      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",
      "President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, \u201cplacing us well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

The 23-year-old tanker ADALYNN belonged to a so-called Russian \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2013 known to operate older ships below basic security standards \u2013 and may have been carrying around 70,000 tons of crude oil, the group said.",

Jayson Tatum in Boston, Damian Lillard in Milwaukee and now Tyrese Haliburton in Indiana all have Achilles injuries and figure to miss most if not all of next season. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James will be going into his 23rd season. Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry is turning 38 next season. Kevin Durant, now of Houston (in a trade that\u2019s going to be official in the coming weeks), is going into his 18th season. Philadelphia\u2019s hopes hinge on Joel Embiid coming back healthy. New York will be dealing with a coaching change.",
      "Oklahoma City seems to have everything right in place.",
      "\u201cThey have a lot of great players on this team,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren all seem to enjoy playing with and off one another, none of them caring who gets credit. Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein fit seamlessly into the roles the Thunder asked them to play. Luguentz Dort is a defensive machine and has come to realize that most people don\u2019t have the ability to appreciate how good he is at that end.",
      "It\u2019s not just the players who don\u2019t care about puffing out their own chests. Same goes for the leadership.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not guaranteed anything in the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing that happens year to year that people forget about. Any moment your team can change with a trade, with an injury, with something that\u2019s out of your control. To be able to get to the pinnacle of this sport and win it is nothing short of extraordinary. To think that you can just walk in and do it every single year is a little bit na\u00efve. Rest assured, we\u2019ll show up Day 1 next year ready to get better and ready to chase this again.\u201d",
      "Presti, the architect of it all, rarely speaks publicly. Same goes for Clay Bennett, the owner. And coach Mark Daigneault is the calm in the eye of any storm, the perfect driver of the Thunder bus.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee you end it the way that we did,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cI just wanted it so bad for them. I was just so thrilled that we were able to get that done and they get to experience this because they deserve it. The way they approach it, the professionalism, competitiveness, team-first nature, like I said, I wanted it so bad for them.\u201d",
      "The journey isn\u2019t over for the Thunder. It\u2019s just starting. Presti has a war chest filled with draft picks and the team has some financial flexibility to add a piece if it so chooses. And now there\u2019s a title to defend.",
      "Labor omnia vincit. There\u2019s more work to do.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of hard work in front of us,\u201d Presti said that day in 2022. \u201cWe have to grind in and do it. That\u2019s what the state is about. That\u2019s what the history of the community is about. That\u2019s what the basketball team here is about.\u201d",

      "A year ago the Baltimore Orioles looked like a dynasty in the making.",
      "Since then, they've been thoroughly mediocre, and even an improved stretch recently hasn't helped their outlook much for 2025.",
      "After losing two of three to the Yankees in New York, the Orioles are 11 games under .500. They've gone 17-10 over their last 27, so perhaps the worst is over, but over the last 162 regular-season games, Baltimore is 75-87. It's a remarkable decline for a team that won 101 games in 2023, started 49-25 last year and had a core of standouts that was young and cost controlled.",
      "Injuries have been a major factor, with catcher and former No. 1 overall draft pick Adley Rutschman the latest big name to go on the IL. Right-hander Grayson Rodriguez hasn't pitched at all this year. Zach Eflin has made only 11 starts with a 5.46 ERA, and outfielder Colton Cowser and infielder Jordan Westburg have missed significant time as well.",
      "The front office has received little sympathy following an offseason in which ace Corbin Burnes departed and the Orioles replaced him with stopgap solutions on one-year deals.",
      "Although Baltimore is just 6 1/2 games out of a postseason spot, FanGraphs isn't a believer, giving the Orioles just a 3.7% chance of making the playoffs. Baltimore is one of five 2024 postseason participants that would miss out if this season ended today. Here are the others:",
      "SAN DIEGO (42-35 record, 39.3% postseason chance according to FanGraphs): The Padres are a half-game behind resurgent Milwaukee for the last spot in the National League playoffs. San Diego has been treading water since a 23-11 start, and its division just became more interesting after San Francisco acquired Rafael Devers.",
      "CLEVELAND (39-37, 34.1%): The Guardians are tied for the final American League spot but would lose a head-to-head tiebreaker to Seattle if the season ended now. Detroit has opened an 8 1/2-game lead in the AL Central, so unless Cleveland can cut into that significantly, it'll be a wild card or bust for the Guardians down the stretch.",
      "ATLANTA (35-41, 27.3%): The talent is there, but this past week was typical for the 2025 Braves, who followed up a three-game sweep of the Mets by losing two of three to Miami.",
      "KANSAS CITY (38-40, 20.0%): Bobby Witt Jr. can only do so much \u2014 only the Pirates have scored fewer runs than the Royals. But the bar in the AL is low, and Kansas City can probably stay in the mix.",
      "In honor of the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder, name the five current major league franchises that have won the World Series in multiple cities.",
      "Clarke Schmidt threw seven hitless innings for the New York Yankees on Saturday in their 9-0 win over Baltimore. The Orioles managed only one hit on the day \u2014 against the New York bullpen.",
      "The Orioles led 8-0 in the third inning at Tampa Bay on Wednesday before the Rays stormed back to win 12-8. Tampa Bay had a 2% chance to win at the start of the third according to Baseball Savant.",
      "Yennier Cano allowed four runs in the fifth to tie the game, and he was sent down to the minors later in the week. Andrew Kittredge then allowed four in the seventh.",
      "That's the issue for the Orioles. Will their pitching allow the kind of hot streak they'd need to jump back into the playoff race?",
      "The Athletics (Philadelphia and Oakland), Braves (Boston, Milwaukee and Atlanta), Dodgers (Brooklyn and Los Angeles), Giants (New York and San Francisco) and Twins (Washington and Minnesota).",

      "The competition is about to stiffen for the U.S. in the CONCACAF Gold Cup",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Matt Freese's gaffe that cost the U.S. the lead in a CONCACAF Gold Cup group play finale drew a reaction from coach Mauricio Pochettino that Americans can apply to the rest of their last competitive test before next year's World Cup.",
      "\u201cMove on,\u201d Pochettino said of the goalkeeper's botched clearing attempt before Patrick Agyemang's tiebreaking 75th-minute goal in a 2-1 victory over Haiti on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cRemember, the most important action is the next one,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf you think in the last one like that, you\u2019re going to do another mistake. This type of accident happened, and it will happen it the future.\u201d",
      "The immediate future for the U.S. after a 3-0 run through Group D is a quarterfinal against Costa Rica or Mexico next weekend. Either way, the opponent will be ranked higher than any of th group opponents.",
      "The U.S. ended a four-match losing streak by beating No. 100 Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its Gold Cup opener, followed by a 1-0 victory over 58th-ranked Saudi Arabia. Haiti is No. 83.",
      "\u201cThe confidence level is super high,\u201d said Brenden Aaronson, who assisted on Malik Tillman's goal that opened the scoring in the 10th minute. \u201cI mean, nine points from three games. We\u2019ve had two shutouts and another win today against a good Haiti team. I think we\u2019re really flying at the moment. Now we have a week to prepare, which we haven\u2019t had for any team.\u201d",
      "Still, the play has been uneven from what amounts to a B team of mostly young and unproven players and A team backups. Several of the usual stars and starters sat out for personal reasons, injuries or playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "Missing the tournament for the U.S. are regulars Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergi\u00f1o Dest.",
      "\u201cWe were not a clinic with the chances that we had,\u201d Pochettino said of the Haiti win. \u201cI think we should have scored more.\u201d",
      "Freese blundered when took a back pass from Tim Ream and tried to play the ball to John Tolkin with his left foot. The ball went straight to Louicius Don Deedson, who took a touch and scored inside the far post for a 1-1 tie in the 19th minute.",
      "The unsightly moment did nothing to dissuade Pochettino, who suggested his decision to go with Freese over Matt Turner will continue in this Gold Cup. The coach thought Freese followed orders by moving on.",
      "\u201cContinues to build me up,\u201d Freese said of Pochettino. \u201cThat\u2019s something I really appreciate. Very grateful for the opportunity. I just want to help the team win as much as I can.\u201d",
      "The U.S. won its group for the 17th time in 18 Gold Cups. The Americans have 43 wins, one loss and five draws in group play, going 3-0 for the seventh time. Still, a four-match losing streak punctuated by a Switzerland's 4-0 blowout in the final Gold Cup tune-up is a not-very-distant memory.",
      "\u201cTo be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best,\u201d Freese said. \u201cI think always continuing to push ourselves and play against harder teams and show what we can do and learn from it and continue to grow as a group ahead of a big summer next summer is an opportunity we\u2019re all looking forward to. We want to continue to move on.\u201d",

      "CROMWELL, Conn. -- J.J. Spaun knows as well as anyone how one little shot can make such a huge difference, even if it's only 85 yards to a green in the shape of a red umbrella floating in the middle of a lake.",
      "It wasn't a shot that won the U.S. Open. Spaun will be remembered far more for the driver he hit onto the 17th green at Oakmont to take the lead, and for the 65-foot putt on the last hole to cap off his sensational birdie-birdie finish at golf's toughest test.",
      "This shot was five years ago at the Travelers Championship. It was no less important to Spaun, who has Type 1 diabetes but didn't know it at the time.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Andy Bessette, the executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Travelers Insurance, and a familiar face behind the tournament. \u201cNot everything in life is for a reason, but at times you have to step back and think it's too weird it happened that way.\u201d",
      "A 15-year tradition at the Travelers is \u201cThe Umbrella at 15 1/2 Challenge,\u201d where players during the pro-am hit an 85-yard shot at the umbrella that sits in the lake between the 15th and 16th holes at the TPC River Highland. The closest to the pin is given $10,000 to donate to charity.",
      "It was in 2020 when Spaun \u2014 who had been misdiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes some 18 months earlier \u2014 hit his lob wedge to 19 inches to win the challenge.",
      "The charity of his choice: The Junior Diabetes Research Foundation, now known as Breakthrough T1D.",
      "\u201cWhen Travelers got word of where I wanted that donation to go, Andy Bessette kind of broke down apparently and was touched very deeply because he's a very integral part of that charity and donates quite a lot of money, too,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cSo that initiated our connection.\u201d",
      "Bessette's son, Chris, was was diagnosed with Type 1 in 2011 at age 18. They are deeply connected with Breakthrough T1D, and when he heard where Spaun directed his donation, the Bessette family immediately matched it.",
      "So began a relationship that became more valuable than Spaun could have imagined.",
      "Even after the initial diagnosis of Type 2 in the fall of 2018, Spaun kept losing weight and energy. Something wasn't right and he knew it.",
      "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin. Type 2 is more common, mainly affect adults. The body doesn't make enough insulin and is often managed with lifestyle changes, such as diet.",
      "Once doctors got the diagnosis right in 2021, Spaun still struggled to find the right treatment for someone who spends five hours or more on the golf course. On one occasion, his close friend Harold Varner III noticed something off and encouraged to tap into Bessette's resources.",
      "\u201cWe called him together, Harold and I, and I said, \u2018J.J., anything you need, you tell me.\u2019 He told me what was going on. It was about getting the right kind of care,\" Bessette said.",
      "In this case, it was a new product that allowed insulin to be inhaled instead of injections, far easier to manage on the course. Bessette also connected him with a doctor in Los Angeles who worked with athletes on how to handle blood sugar levels.",
      "\u201cHe is very well connected with the diabetes community, so all these doctors were at my disposal,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "A tough road is nothing new to Spaun. He was a walk-on at San Diego State. He spent three years on developmental circuits before reaching the PGA Tour. He had to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour, fell as low as No. 584 in the world ranking in 2021 and won for the first time a year later at the Texas Open.",
      "Spaun has dips in form, as most golfers do. He was worried a year ago about losing his card until he pulled it together late last year. He was getting closer, losing in a playoff at The Players Championship to Rory McIlroy, before his epic breakthrough at Oakmont.",
      "It resonated in some corners more than others.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome to see him have the week he had,\u201d said Eric Cole, who also has Type 1 diabetes and has risen from the mini-tours to play in six of the last seven majors. \u201cIt's cool to see diabetes doesn't slow him down. He has a lot of extra stuff to deal with behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Imagine the thrill for Bessette when he watched Spaun overcome a misdiagnosis and manage Type 1 diabetes to handle the highest pressure in the game. Bessette can relate. He qualified as a hammer thrower for the 1980 Olympics that the U.S. boycotted.",
      "\u201cI think this is one of the most amazing achievements in sport for somebody who has Type 1, whose sugar levels are up and down, trying to keep them under control and win the U.S. Open,\u201d Bessette said. \u201cAre you kidding me? It's brutal competition for four days. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m amazed by what you did.'\"",
      "Spaun returned to the Travelers Championship this year with an empty tank. He said blood sugar levels crashed hard after he won at Oakmont, from the battle on the back nine but more from the emotion and celebration and all the media obligations that followed.",
      "Five years after he hit an 85-yard shot onto a red umbrella, he returned with a big silver trophy as the U.S. Open champion. Bessette was beaming, and the connection wasn't lost on Spaun.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s kind of been there for me the whole way,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cEven when I got my diagnosis corrected, I guess, it was even more so helpful to have JDRF and Andy on my side to kind of help me navigate another new territory.\u201d",

      "Indiana Pacers fans arrived at Gainbridge Fieldhouse ready to celebrate their first NBA title",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The gasp inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse was followed quickly by a hush Sunday night.",
      "Just seven minutes into Game 7 of the NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers' roaring fans went silent, struggling to fathom what they were watching \u2014 a replay of two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton hurting his lower right leg and the anguished look on the face of his father, John.",
      "They didn't wait to hear the diagnosis; they already figured they had it.",
      "\u201cI saw (his Achilles tendon) pop immediately, you could see it kind of explode,\u201d said 37-year-old Nick Poore, a lifelong fan of his hometown team. \u201cTough. I mean it is what it is, life goes on. What else can you do besides take it on the chin, you know?\u201d",
      "Coach Rick Carlisle didn't confirm it was a torn Achilles tendon either during his postgame comments though he noted the team's hearts dropped just like so many inside their home arena.",
      "Of course, Haliburton's teammates tried valiantly to rally without their leader but struggled late in the third quarter and early in the fourth of a 103-91 loss at Oklahoma City, a loss that extended Indiana's title drought to 49 years and left many wondering what's next?",
      "This one may have been the most gut-wrenching of all.",
      "A strained right calf had limited Haliburton to 23 minutes Thursday night, but he scored 14 points and had five assists to help Indiana force Sunday's decisive game. With two more days of rest, Haliburton said he felt better and he was early with three 3-pointers and nine points, his best start in the series.",
      "\u201cTyrese was about to cook, he was going to go off,\u201d Poore said. \u201cThat was tough because you could tell he was bringing it tonight.\u201d",
      "But one wrong step ended Haliburton's night and dashed the hopes of so many Pacers fans who came to celebrate the title they'd longed for.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not what we wanted to see but you know what he\u2019s going to want. He\u2019s going to want this team to continue to fight,\u201d Chris Denari, the Pacers\u2019 television play-by-play announcer told the stunned crowd. \u201cHe is the leader of this team. We know what he\u2019s meant since he arrived from Sacramento and he\u2019s going to need all of our thoughts and prayers, but he's going to want this team to fight and win an NBA title.\u201d",
      "The crowd responded to Denari's plea, cheering raucously for each Pacers basket, defensive stop, Thunder foul or turnover. But the late runs eventually took their toll, quieting fans and sending some home for good after Oklahoma City built a 21-point lead.",
      "Worse, it's yet another potentially cruel chapter in the franchise\u2019s long and painful history.",
      "Since the three-time ABA champion team joined the NBA, it has endured every seemingly imaginable and unimaginable setback: the 1977 telethon that saved the team, the Malice in the Palace that cost Reggie Miller his last title shot, near-misses against LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals and Boston's sweep in the conference finals last year with the injured Haliburton watching the last two games from the bench.",
      "There\u2019s also the injury history. Since Miller's retirement, Danny Granger, Paul George and Victor Oladipo all appeared poised to be the Pacers next big thing \u2014 only to have their careers derailed by injuries. Now it's Haliburton trying to break the jinx.",
      "\u201cHeartbreaking,\u201d said Vernon Morgan, who has followed the Pacers since George McGinnis played for the ABA team in the early 1970s. \u201cWe're still waiting to see if this (injury) will be a detriment to his career or if he's going to recover from it. I realize he'll be out probably all of next year, but we've been counted out before.\"",
      "How tough has this been on Pacers fans?",
      "Anthony Brehob, age 27, came dressed in a Roy Hibbert jersey and had big expectations and like many who stood in the snaking lines on the city's streets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m expecting a close game, and I\u2019m really hoping Haliburton pulls it off at the end,\" Brehob said. \"If they lose, it\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d",
      "The problem now is it's also going to be a long offseason with many questions surrounding Haliburton and what can be expected when he does return.",
      "Carlisle said he expects Haliburton, who was on crutches Sunday night, to make a full recovery. And in a state that loves underdogs so much it's produced both the real-life and Hollywood version of \u201cHoosiers,\" the reality is the future still looks bright.",
      "And that at least is some solace to these fans.",
      "\u201cIt's enough to celebrate,\u201d Morgan said of Indiana's playoff run. \u201cWe pushed them to Game 7 and it's a young team. They'll be back. We've been counted out before, nobody counted on us to make a good story. We'll be back again next year.\u201d",

      "Eight minutes later, G\u00fcler made it 2-0 when he delivered a right-footed shot from the center of the box to the bottom left corner off an assist from Gonzalo Garc\u00eda.

But Madrid stayed on the attack and Bellingham had the breakthrough goal.",

That changed on Sunday as the talented roster began to mesh, with precise passing leading to both first-half goals.",

      "Ohtani yielded two hits and a run while throwing 28 pitches in the first inning Monday against San Diego in his first mound outing since 2023. Ohtani's movement on his breaking pitches was sharp, and his fastball hit 100 mph, but his command was \u201cjust OK,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Roberts said there's no firm timeline for Ohtani to extend his starts to full length. The Dodgers also have made no long-term decisions about how they will handle the day-to-day details of the dual pursuits of baseball\u2019s only serious two-way player in several decades.",
      "Roberts acknowledged that Ohtani could move out of his customary leadoff spot in the Dodgers\u2019 lineup on the days when he pitches, particularly at home. While Ohtani has told Roberts he isn't bothered by pitching the first inning and then going straight to the on-deck circle to be the Dodgers\u2019 first batter in the bottom half, Roberts recognizes it\u2019s not ideal.",
      "\u201cHe's said that he's completely fine with hitting leadoff (and) doesn't want to change,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo I think that for now, we'll stay status quo, but coming out of this one, you could say maybe it might make more sense to hit second or third or fourth.\u201d",
      "Ohtani went just 4 for 23 with 11 strikeouts at the plate in the Dodgers\u2019 last six games, and that includes his two-hit performance last Monday during his mound return. He has homered in just one of his past 18 games, although he still entered Sunday tied for third in the majors with 25 homers.",
      "The Dodgers will be patient with Ohtani as he readjusts to two-way life while managing the demands of both jobs.",
      "\u201cI have not seen signs of fatigue,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI think that like all hitters, when you start chasing outside the strike zone, it's hard to have consistent success. I don't think that's a fatigue thing, but we'll manage it, and I think that I can only take him at his word, and the swing speed and stuff you track is still in line. Again, once we ramp up more, it might be a different conversation.\u201d",
      "Ohtani didn't pitch at all last season while recovering from arm surgery during his first season with the Dodgers under a 10-year, $700 million contract. He won his third MVP award while becoming the first player in baseball history with 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season, and the Dodgers won his first World Series championship.",
      "Ohtani entered Sunday third in the majors with a .996 OPS, but some of his other offensive numbers have gone down slightly this season while he returned to a steady throwing program.",
      "The Dodgers have no public concerns about Ohtani's production, remaining supportive of his two-way play \u2014 and they need his arm, given their season-long injury woes on the mound.",

      "The Florida Panthers are getting pretty good at these parades.",
      "The back-to-back Stanley Cup winners had their championship parade and rally on Fort Lauderdale Beach on Sunday, the same setup as last year \u2014 except this time, bright sunshine greeted the champs as opposed to downpours and lightning a year ago.",
      "\u201cIt's a little better day today than it was last year, but still, this is amazing,\u201d Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. \u201cWhat a day we're having with you guys.\u201d",
      "Panthers coach Paul Maurice declared this \u201cthe summer of love\u201d for fans of the team, doing so while wearing another shirt featured his beloved cats Poppy and Penny \u2014 a shirt made by his daughter. He wore a similar shirt to last year's parade, also made by his daughter.",
      "There were cries of \u201cThank you, Boston!\u201d when Brad Marchand \u2014 who came to Florida in a trade with the rival Bruins \u2014 was introduced. Marchand, a free agent, again indicated that he wants to be back with the Panthers, who won this season's Cup by topping the Edmonton Oilers in six games.",
      "\u201cI'm so happy that I don't have to play against these guys anymore,\u201d Marchand said, pointing to his Florida teammates.",
      "Forward Matthew Tkachuk drew loud roars when he told the crowd that he \u201cwould like to apologize to absolutely ... nobody because a double champ does whatever ... he wants,\" copying a line used by Conor McGregor when he became a double UFC champion.",
      "\u201cI could get used to this,\u201d Tkachuk said as he looked out at the crowd \u2014 some of whom were in the water, with most others packed hundreds of yards deep down the sand. Tkachuk then thanked team owner Vincent Viola and general manager and hockey operations president Bill Zito for trading for him three years ago, saying it changed his life.",
      "Defenseman Aaron Ekblad, just as he did last year, took a shot at golfer Brooks Koepka, who famously went to a Panthers game once to heckle the veteran defenseman.",
      "Forward Sam Reinhart, who scored four goals in the clinching win over Edmonton, missed last year's parade because a close friend was getting married. He didn't miss Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I've heard all day is how this is the best parade that's ever been had in South Florida,\" Reinhart said. \u201cThank God I missed last year and not this year.\u201d",
      "Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky thanked the crowd, and said he hoped there was another parade next year. And Sam Bennett, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner, heard the crowd chanting their hopes of him getting a new contract with the Panthers.",
      "So, he ended his speech with the same request.",
      "\u201cEight more years, please,\u201d Bennett said.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country.",
      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",

      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",
      "New York is improperly trying \u201cto inject itself into the content-moderation editorial process\u201d by requiring \u201cpolitically charged disclosures\u201d about it, Bastrop, Texas-based X Corp. argues in the suit.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed.

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "KOGE MARINA, Denmark -- From a distance they look almost like ordinary sailboats, their sails emblazoned with the red-and-white flag of Denmark.",
      "But these 10-meter (30-foot) -long vessels carry no crew and are designed for surveillance.",
      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats, known as \u201cVoyagers,\u201d have been put into service by Denmark's armed forces for a three-month operational trial.",
      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe security situation in the Baltic is tense,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Kim J\u00f8rgensen, the director of Danish National Armaments at the ministry. \u201cThey\u2019re going to cruise Danish waters, and then later they\u2019re going to join up with the two that are on (the) NATO exercise. And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO member. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Western officials accuse Russia of behind behind a string of hybrid war attacks on land and at sea.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defense College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a layered system that will enable us to keep constant monitoring of potential threats, but at a much cheaper level than before,\u201d he added.",

      "The final witness for the prosecution, Joseph Cerciello of Homeland Security Investigations, walked the jury through reams of travel records, hotel invoices and money transfers that prosecutors hope will convince the jury that Combs and his associates trafficked his ex-girlfriend, who testified earlier under the pseudonym \u201cJane.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 former assistant, Brendan Paul, who was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony, previously told the jury that he bought and carried drugs for Combs. Paul was arrested in March 2024 for cocaine possession while aboard a private plane with Combs.",
      "\u201cWas the cocaine yours, Mr. Paul?\u201d prosecutor Christy Slavik asked.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Paul testified in response.",
      "\u201cWhose cocaine was it?\u201d Slavik followed up.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs,\u201d Paul testified.",
      "The drug charges against Paul were dropped last year after he completed a pre-trial intervention program.",
      "The criminal enterprise Combs is accused of operating committed drug offenses, according to federal prosecutors. Combs has conceded that he used illicit drugs but has denied running a criminal enterprise. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the government's charges.",
      "Paul also told the jury that Combs wanted his assistants to \u201cmove like SEAL Team Six\u201d and anticipate his every need. He testified that it was part of his job to buy a pound of marijuana every two months and to procure a powdery mix of ketamine and molly, known as tusi, that was \u201cdyed pink for the aesthetic.\u201d",
      "Paul further testified that he set up hotel rooms for so-called \"freak-off\" sexual encounters, which he knew as \u201cwild king nights,\u201d stocking items like lubricant and baby oil. The jury saw photos of the items arranged in Combs\u2019 Los Angeles homes.",
      "On cross-examination, Paul testified that he never noticed \u201cJane\u201d being hesitant or apprehensive about participating in what she called \u201chotel night\u201d sexual encounters.",
      "Once prosecutors rest their case, defense attorneys have said their case will likely take a day or two to present.",

    "story": [
      "Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed or severely degraded, officials said.",
      "Code-named \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" the top-secret U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities launched overnight was the largest strike using B2 bombers in history and it was the longest flight involving the fleet since 2001, Pentagon officials said Sunday.",
      "The mission included the first use of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, or MOP, which had only previously been used in a testing role, according to officials.",
      "\"Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a Sunday morning press briefing at the Pentagon, following the attacks.",
      "More than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, including seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers which were launched from the continental United States shortly after midnight Eastern Time and refueled multiple times in midair as they flew 18 hours to reach their targets, Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during the press briefing. Other aircraft that participated in the mission included B-2 bombers used as decoys, as well as refueling tankers, fighter escorts, and drones that provided Intelligence, surveillance and target acquisition, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Caine said that just after 2 a.m. Iran time, the B-2 bombers began dropping 14 MOP bombs in strikes on two of Iran's nuclear facilities -- the Natanz and Fordo sites. Each MOP bomb measures about 20 feet long, weighs 30,000 pounds and is capable of penetrating 200 feet deep inside a target before exploding.",
      "Caine called \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" a \"complex and high-risk mission.\"",
      "A total of 13 B-2 bombers took off around the same time on Saturday morning from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, according to Caine. Six B-2 bombers were sent to the Pacific Island of Guam as decoys while the seven bombers used to target Iran's underground nuclear facilities quietly headed east to conduct the mission with little communication to avoid detection, Caine said.",
      "Just before dropping their payloads on Iran's nuclear facilities, Caine said two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at the Isfahan nuclear site in Iran from a U.S. submarine positioned in the region.",
      "The Tomahawks were fired before the B-2 bombers carried out their airstrikes, Caine said. However, because of their slower flight times and the distance they had to travel, the Tomahawk missiles did not strike their targets at Isfahan until shortly after the B-2 bombers had dropped their 14 bombs.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the B-2 bombers sent to Guam ever landed there. All 13 bombers are expected to arrive back at Whiteman Air Force Base early Sunday afternoon, according to officials.",
      "Following the attack, President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the White House with Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio standing behind him.",
      "\"A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number-one state sponsor of terror,\" Trump said.",
      "The president added, \"Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "During Sunday's press briefing, Hegseth said, \"No other country on planet earth could have pulled off the operation,\" echoing a statement Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform following the attack.",
      "\"This is a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the president of the United States called,' Hegseth said. \"It took a great deal of precision. It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security.\"",
      "Caine said no Iranian troops or civilian structures were targeted and that throughout the mission, \"we maintained the element of surprise.\" He said \"very few people in Washington\" knew the timing and nature of the plan and that congressional leaders were not briefed until the mission was underway.",
      "Hegseth said the B-2 bombers, each with a two-person crew, reached the nuclear facility targets and struck them without ever being detected by Iranian forces, saying the stealth aircraft got \"in and out and back without the world knowing at all.\"",
      "Iran did not deploy its fighter or surface-to-air missiles during the mission, Caine said.",
      "Prior to the mission, Israeli forces had spent about 10 days crippling Iran's air-defense capabilities, destroying much of its fighter aircraft and leaving the country's military airfields severely damaged.",
      "While Hegseth and the White House touted the mission as a huge success, an assessment is underway to determine extent of the damage to the nuclear facilities, Caine said during Sunday morning's briefing.",
      "\"The battle damage assessment is ongoing but our initial assessment, as the chairman said, is that all of our precision munitions struck where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect, which means, especially the primary target here, we believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth emphasized that the purpose of the mission was to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, a goal that, according to the White House, the country was just days away from achieving.",
      "Hegseth also said that the mission was not aimed at a regime change in Iran. He said public and private messages are being directly delivered to the Iranians through multiple channels, \u201cgiving them every opportunity to come to the table\" and negotiate a peace settlement.",
      "\"They understand precisely what the American position is, precisely what steps they can take to allow for peace, and we hope they do so,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth said that while \"anything can happen in conflict,\" the operation is not open-ended: \"We acknowledge that but the scope of this was intentionally limited,\" he said.",
      "According to Caine, troops in the region were not given an advance warning of the attacks. In the wake of the strike, Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), overseeing military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, elevated force protection measures across the region, especially in Iraq, Syria and the Gulf, said Caine.",
      "\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice,\" Caine said. \"We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority.\u201d",

      "In the wake of President Donald Trump's \"massive precision strikes\" on Iran, concerns have been raised both for Americans in the region and at home.",
      "A principal area of worry is cyberattacks by Iranian state actors, including targeting the banking system or energy grid.",
      "A recent Department of Homeland Security bulletin warned: \"Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors will probably prioritize retaliatory attacks against Israeli targets in the short term but may target U.S. networks due to their perception of U.S. support for Israeli strikes.\"",
      "The bulletin urged domestic critical infrastructure entities to \"immediately\" assess and shore up their security. Such attacks have already infiltrated U.S. water and wastewater systems, according to the non-profit think tank Center for Internet Security, which briefed law enforcement on Friday.",
      "The Center was also concerned that Iran, in the wake of Israeli military strikes, might use \"crude or escalatory tactics\" or informal networks if its capabilities were degraded.",
      "\"The likelihood of such attacks will increase if the U.S. strikes Iran or overtly provides military support to the Israeli air campaign,\" the group said.",
      "And the Center assessed that Iran's considerable network of proxy groups might be able to strike U.S. interests in the Middle East, though their capacity to strike the U.S. homeland was more limited.",
      "The groups, they assessed, while less sophisticated, could still disrupt public infrastructure and the private sector.",
      "On top of that was the fear of attacks by foreign nationals or American citizens inspired to strike the U.S.",
      "In 2018, the National Counterterrorism Center issued a report saying Iran-sponsored or Shia-inspired -- referring to one of the two major branches of Islam which is dominant in Iran -- terror on the U.S. homeland is unlikely, except if the U.S. were to attack Iran.",
      "\"Given sustained bilateral U.S.-Iran tensions, the occurrence of such a catalyst could prompt Shia HVE [homegrown violent extremist] activity relatively quickly, underscoring the benefits of early engagement with Shia communities about indicators of HVE radicalization. Potential triggering events for such Shia HVE violence include U.S. military action against Iran.\"",
      "Iranian forces themselves have previously targeted American interests, hitting U.S. bases in the Middle East, for instance, after top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed in an American airstrike in Iraq in 2020.",
      "Iranian nationals have also carried out major cyberattacks.",

But we feel very confident that the Fordo nuclear site was substantially set back, and that was our goal.\"",

      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

    "summary": "Rep. Jim Himes said it was still too soon to know if U.S. strikes against Iranian facilities had substantially weakened the country\u2019s nuclear program.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to see how this plays out,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes said.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said it was too early to know the success of a series of U.S. attacks against Iran -- calling the strikes a \"massive gamble\" on the part of President Donald Trump and citing past U.S. military action in the region.",
      "\"I mean, we've seen this movie before. Every conflict in the Middle East has its Senator Tom Cotton who promised us mushroom clouds. In the Iraq war, it was Condoleezza Rice promising us a mushroom cloud. And initially -- and this is true of every one of these wars -- in Libya, in Iraq -- in Iraq and Afghanistan, initially, things look pretty good. Saddam Hussein is gone. Moammar Gadhafi is gone. The Afghan Taliban are gone. And then over time, we start to learn what the cost is. Four thousand four hundred Americans dead in Iraq. The Taliban back in power,\" Himes told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
      "Himes noted that it is too soon to call the attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities a success and cautioned against applauding them.",
      "\"But bottom line is we don't know, and if you look at the three conflicts I just mentioned, I would keep the optimism under the hat for a little while yet,\" he added.",
      "Himes also said that he was \"disturbed\" by the fact that the strikes were undertaken without the approval of Congress, which holds the sole authority to declare war.",
      "\"There's not much ambiguity in the Constitution about who gets to approve these things,\" Himes said.",
      "Here are more highlights from Himes' interview:",
      "Karl: But some of the president's critics have actually applauded the action last night. Let me read you what Adam Kinzinger -- obviously no friend of the president -- had to say. He said, \"The U.S. attack on the nuclear facilities in my opinion was the right call. We will see what the results are, but now, the key -- but now, the key is suppressing surface-to-surface missile fire and negotiate an end to the fight with Iran. Good call by the president.\" Is it possible that this ends up being just that, a good call by President Trump?",
      "Himes: Is it possible? Again, setting aside the constitutional issues which we should never set aside because the Constitution matters, is there some chance that, you know, we got all the nuclear material, the regime falls, and you know, next spring, we're picnicking at Summer Con? Yeah, there is some chance that that is true. But if you look at the history -- and again, all we have is history to go on -- if you look at the history of our military involvements in the region, they almost never end with the best-case scenario. In fact, they usually end in something approximating the worst-case scenario.",
      "Karl: And what do you think is the worst-case scenario?",
      "Himes: Oh, well, the worst-case scenario is that, you know, the Iranians have a lot more missiles than we think they do, and we end up with dead soldiers and sailors in the region, that they managed to move the nuclear material out of Fordo, and it's sitting in a warehouse right now. And as we speak, they are building a device. I mean, believe me, I will concede that there is some small chance for a best-case scenario here, there always is. But again, history suggests that you better be well -- you know, aware of the fact that the best-case scenario almost never happens. So, I mean, you can paint a truly apocalyptic picture of any number of a dozen.",

      "\"That's not President Trump's military objective,\" Cotton said. \"We are not pursuing regime change. We're not trying to put any troops on the ground into Iran. We are trying to eliminate their nuclear weapons program, and by destroying three critical nuclear facilities, we've taken huge steps in that direction.\"",
      "But back in 2017, the Arkansas senator told POLITICO, \"The policy of the United States should be regime change in Iran. ... I don\u2019t see how anyone can say America can be safe as long as you have in power a theocratic despotism.\"",

That's the point that President Trump made last night,\" Cotton said. \"We're not going to invade Iran. We're not going to try to topple their government or try to replace it with a new government. As [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, the Iranian leaders are so hated by their own people, have so failed to deliver positive results for their own people, that that might be the end of this.

      "Americans\u2019 support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.",
      "The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults\u2019 support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.",
      "The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.",
      "The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults \u2014 including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans \u2014 approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.",
      "About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn\u2019t changed measurably.",
      "\u201cAs far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,\u201d said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.",
      "The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.",
      "\u201cFor solar panels, in all honesty, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that efficient yet,\u201d said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. \u201cI\u2019d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that\u2019s just my thought.\u201d",
      "Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump\u2019s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.",
      "Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.",
      "When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.",

      "People fearful of being arrested for wearing masks while protesting immigration raids in Los Angeles and other cities have voiced anger over Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents covering their faces",
      "CHICAGO -- President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly called for mask-wearing at protests to be banned and for protesters whose faces are covered to be arrested, with the most recent push following demonstrations in Los Angeles over immigration raids.",
      "Legal experts told The Associated Press there are a variety of reasons people may want to cover their faces while protesting, including to protect their health, for religious reasons, to avoid government retaliation, to prevent surveillance and doxing, or to protect themselves from tear gas. With legislative action happening across the U.S., they say it's only a matter of time before the issue returns to the courts.",
      "Protesters, meanwhile, have voiced anger over footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents covering their faces at immigration raids and masked officers at the Los Angeles protests, calling it a double standard.",
      "Here are some things to know about the debate over face masks:",
      "At least 18 states and Washington, D.C., have laws that restrict masks and other face coverings in some way, said Elly Page, senior legal adviser with the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law. Since October 2023, at least 16 bills have been introduced in eight states and Congress to restrict masks at protests, according to the center.",
      "Many of these laws date back to the 1940s and \u201950s when many states passed anti-mask laws as a response to the Ku Klux Klan, whose members hid their identities while terrorizing victims. Amid protests against the war in Gaza and the Republican president\u2019s immigration policies, Page said there have been attempts to revive these rarely used laws to target protesters, sometimes inconsistently.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to arrest protesters for wearing masks came as federal agents were seen donning masks while conducting raids in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities.",
      "Democratic lawmakers in California have introduced legislation aiming to stop federal agents and local police officers from wearing face masks amid concerns that ICE agents were attempting to hide their identities and avoid accountability for potential misconduct during high-profile immigration raids.",
      "The issue also came up at a congressional hearing on June 12, when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized ICE agents wearing masks during raids, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t wear masks. Identify who you are.\u201d",
      "Republican federal officials have maintained that masks protect agents from doxing. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the California bill \u201cdespicable.\"",
      "Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor, said the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the right to free speech includes the right to speak out anonymously. But he said how it should apply to protesters wearing masks remains \u201can unresolved First Amendment question.\u201d",
      "For Stone, that raises a key question: Why should protesters and ICE agents be subject to different rules?",
      "\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want them to be targeted because they engaged in their responsibilities as ICE agents,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the same thing as the argument as to why you want demonstrators to wear masks. They want to wear masks so they can do their \u2018jobs\u2019 of engaging in free speech properly. The same rationale for the officers wearing masks should apply to the protesters.\u201d",

      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has vetoed a bill to ban all THC products",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a bill Sunday to ban all THC consumables, allowing the booming market flush with THC-infused vapes, gummies and other products to continue to be sold across the state.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",
      "Last year, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill that would have put age restrictions on THC consumables, claiming it would hurt small businesses.",

      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained her last month.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \u201cMama will be back soon.\u201d When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He\u2019s worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \u201cnot a very political person\u201d but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all for \u2018get the criminals out of the country,\u2019 right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s always been a way to secure a green card.\u201d",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \u201cno idea\u201d about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \u201cploy.\u201d",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\u201d said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \u201cYou take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\u201d",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \u201cis in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \u201cnot going to ignore the rule of law.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring an Immigration Judge\u2019s order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\u201d U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \u201chas a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\u201d",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\u201cShe was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \u201cwill no longer exempt\u201d from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \u201cprotection from deportation\u201d for family members.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\u201d Stock said. \u201cIt sends the wrong message to the recruits.\u201d",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \u201cnot the proper authority\u201d to \u201cimply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump wants on his desk by July 4 would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns",
      "WASHINGTON -- The massive tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump wants on his desk by July 4 would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns, advancing a longtime priority of the gun industry as Republican leaders in the House and Senate try to win enough votes to pass the bill.",
      "The guns provision was first requested in the House by Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican gun store owner who had initially opposed the larger tax package. The House bill would remove silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms that are considered the most dangerous, eliminating a $200 tax while removing a layer of background checks.",
      "The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Republicans who have long supported the changes, along with the gun industry, say the tax infringes on Second Amendment rights. They say silencers are mostly used by hunters and target shooters for sport.",
      "\u201cBurdensome regulations and unconstitutional taxes shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of protecting American gun owners\u2019 hearing,\u201d said Clyde, who owns two gun stores in Georgia and often wears a pin shaped like an assault rifle on his suit lapel.",
      "Democrats are fighting to stop the provision, which was unveiled days after two Minnesota state legislators were shot in their homes, as the bill speeds through the Senate. They argue that loosening regulations on silencers could make it easier for criminals and active shooters to conceal their weapons.",
      "\u201cParents don\u2019t want silencers on their streets, police don\u2019t want silencers on their streets,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "The gun language has broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues. But it is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items included to entice members to vote for the legislation that could have broad implications if the bill is enacted within weeks, as Trump wants.",
      "Inclusion of the provision is also a sharp turn from the climate in Washington just three years ago when Democrats, like Republicans now, controlled Congress and the White House and pushed through bipartisan gun legislation. The bill increased background checks for some buyers under the age of 21, made it easier to take firearms from potentially dangerous people and sent millions of dollars to mental health services in schools.",
      "Passed in the summer of 2022, just weeks after the shooting of 19 children and two adults at a school in Uvalde, Texas, it was the most significant legislative response to gun violence in decades.",
      "Three years later, as they try to take advantage of their consolidated power in Washington, Republicans are packing as many of their longtime priorities as possible, including the gun legislation, into the massive, wide-ranging bill that Trump has called \u201cbeautiful.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad the Senate is joining the House to stand up for the Second Amendment and our Constitution, and I will continue to fight for these priorities as the Senate works to pass President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who was one of the lead negotiators on the bipartisan gun bill in 2022 but is now facing a primary challenge from the right in his bid for reelection next year.",
      "If the gun provisions remain in the larger legislation and it is passed, silencers and the short-barrel rifles and shotguns would lose an extra layer of regulation that they are subject to under the National Firearms Act, passed in the 1930s in response to concerns about mafia violence. They would still be subject to the same regulations that apply to most other guns \u2014 and that includes possible loopholes that allow some gun buyers to avoid background checks when guns are sold privately or online.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, says changes are aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argues that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane says.",
      "Speaking on the floor before the bill passed the House, Rep. Clyde said the bill restores Second Amendment rights from \u201cover 90 years of draconian taxes.\u201d Clyde said Johnson included his legislation in the larger bill \u201cwith the purest of motive.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho asked for it? I asked,\u201d said Clyde, who ultimately voted for the bill after the gun silencer provision was added.",
      "Clyde was responding to Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 28-year-old Florida Democrat, who went to the floor and demanded to know who was responsible for the gun provision. Frost, who was a gun-control activist before being elected to Congress, called himself a member of the \u201cmass shooting generation\u201d and said the bill would help \u201cgun manufacturers make more money off the death of children and our people.\u201d",
      "Among other concerns, control advocates say less regulation for silencers could make it harder for law enforcement to stop an active shooter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "Schumer and other Democrats are trying to convince the Senate parliamentarian to drop the language as she reviews the bill for policy provisions that aren\u2019t budget-related.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats will fight this provision at the parliamentary level and every other level with everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Schumer said earlier this month.",

      "For more than a week, President Donald Trump kept the world wondering whether he would join Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran in an attempt to decapitate the country\u2019s nuclear program",
      "WASHINGTON -- For more than a week, President Donald Trump kept the world wondering whether he would join Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran in an attempt to decapitate the country\u2019s nuclear program. The guessing ended this weekend, when American stealth bombers, fighter jets and a submarine struck with bombs and missiles.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision marks one of the riskiest foreign policy decisions by a U.S. president in recent memory, potentially plunging the nation back into armed conflict in the Middle East with no clear endgame.",
      "Like most of Trump\u2019s presidency, the path to military action was unconventional and played out on social media, as he alternatively pledged diplomacy, demanded the evacuation of Tehran, threatened the ayatollah and ultimately announced the U.S. strike.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the last 11 days unfolded, a cascade of events that could reshape a combustible corner of the globe. All dates below are in Eastern time.",
      "The first sign that conflict could be on the horizon came when families of U.S. troops began leaving the Middle East. \u201cThey are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for opening night of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d one of his favorite musicals.",
      "It wasn't clear whether Israel was preparing to strike, fulfilling years of threats to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program, or if the movements were a feint to increase pressure for negotiations. The next round of talks between Washington and Tehran was just days away, and Trump was adamant about reaching a diplomatic solution.",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israeli military operation was already taking shape.",
      "Trump said an attack by Israel \u201ccould very well happen.\u201d But Iran still seemed to be taken by surprise. Around 8 p.m. in Washington, explosions in Tehran killed top military leaders and scientists. Multiple sites connected to Iran\u2019s nuclear program were also hit.",
      "Israel said 200 warplanes took part in the first wave of attacks. More damage was done with drones that Israeli spies had smuggled into the country, destroying air defenses and missile launchers.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as a \u201ctargeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival.\u201d Although Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes, Israeli leaders claimed it was an imminent threat.",
      "Trump posted on social media that \u201cwe remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution,\u201d but his tone would soon change.",
      "Iran retaliated against Israel with missiles and drones, many of which were shot down by air defenses. As Trump started his day in Washington, he seemed impressed by Israeli military prowess and his tone became more aggressive toward Iran.",
      "\u201cThe United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "But Trump suggested that diplomacy was his first choice, and urged Iran to make a deal. \u201cNow they have, perhaps, a second chance\u201d to get it done, he said.",
      "Trump talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the morning, and they discussed the conflict between Israel and Iran. The next round of talks between the U.S. and Iran was canceled.",
      "As Israel and Iran continued to trade strikes, Trump attended a military parade in Washington. It was the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, as well as his 79th birthday.",
      "The muscular display of American military might \u2014 tanks, troops, paratroopers and a 21-gun salute \u2014 played out in the nation's capital as the potential for a new conflict loomed.",
      "Trump spent the day talking up his reputation as a peacemaker, encouraging Iran and Israel to \u201cmake a deal\u201d similar to how he had brokered an end to fighting between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cMany calls and meetings now taking place,\u201d Trump wrote on social media. \u201cI do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232",
      "Iran\u2019s health ministry said 224 people had been killed by Israeli strikes at this point in the conflict. Reports also emerged that Trump had rejected an Israeli plan to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. U.S. officials viewed the idea as dangerously destabilizing.",
      "Trump flew to Canada for the annual Group of Seven summit, which gathers the world\u2019s most powerful democracies. He would not be there long.",
      "Israel claimed it had achieved \u201caerial superiority\u201d over Tehran, allowing its warplanes to operate freely in the skies above Iran\u2019s capital. One of the strikes hit Iran\u2019s state-run television, abruptly stopping a live broadcast. Netanyahu said Israeli strikes set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program a \u201cvery, very long time.\u201d",
      "However, the extent of the damage was unclear, and U.S. and Israeli officials believed only American planes with specially designed \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs had the capability to destroy nuclear sites buried deep underground.",
      "After a single day at the G7 summit, the White House abruptly announced that Trump would leave early on a red-eye flight to Washington to meet with his national security team.",
      "Trump demanded Iran\u2019s \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER\u201d in a post on social media and he told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted \u201ca real end\u201d to the conflict, not just a ceasefire.",
      "He expressed frustration with Iranian leaders for failing to reach an agreement. \u201cThey should have done the deal. I told them, \u2018Do the deal,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not too much in the mood to negotiate.\u201d",
      "Trump also brushed off assessments from U.S. spy agencies that Iran hadn\u2019t decided to build a nuclear weapon. He insisted they were \u201cvery close.\u201d",
      "The sun had not yet risen when Trump arrived at the White House. He took part in a meeting in the Situation Room, but did not appear publicly.",
      "With little clarity on next steps, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that \"I\u2019m here to take questions, not necessarily answer them.\u201d",
      "By this point, there was no question that Trump was considering joining Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran. \u201cI may do it, I may not do it,\u201d he said that morning. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "The president spoke to reporters while overseeing the installation of a massive new flagpole on the South Lawn of the White House, toggling back and forth between chatting up construction workers in hard hats and sizing up the Iranian nuclear threat.",
      "Later, in the Oval Office, Trump again suggested that the U.S. might get directly involved to thwart Iran\u2019s atomic ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.\u201d",
      "On Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers the Pentagon was presenting Trump with military options.",
      "It was a federal holiday \u2014 Juneteenth \u2014 and much of Washington took the hot, steamy day off, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt scheduled a briefing nonetheless.",
      "She entered the briefing room to deliver a message from the president: He would decide within two weeks whether to become directly involved in Israel\u2019s war on Iran.",
      "Trump has long been known to toss out \u201ctwo week\u201d deadlines for actions that never materialize, so the statement left people guessing on his next move.",
      "Trump convened another meeting of his national security advisers and then flew to his golf club in New Jersey, where he attended a political fundraiser in the evening. He talked to reporters briefly en route, long enough to say his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \u201cwrong\u201d when she previously said that the U.S. believed Iran wasn\u2019t building a nuclear weapon.",
      "Around midnight, the U.S. military operation began in secret: B-2 stealth bombers taking off from a base in Missouri. They headed east, over the Atlantic Ocean, refueling from airborne tankers along the way. It would take them 18 hours to reach Iran. A decoy flight went west, toward the Pacific.",
      "Trump returned to the White House from New Jersey around 6 p.m. Less than an hour later, American ordinance began exploding in Tehran.",
      "More than two dozen Tomahawk missiles were fired from a U.S. submarine. Fighter jets scanned for Iranian interceptors. The stealth bombers dropped 14 bunker buster bombs, marking the first time that the 30,000-pound weapon had been used in combat.",
      "Trump announced the strikes on social media, saying it was a \u201cvery successful attack and \u201cNOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!\u201d In a brief national address from the White House, the president threatened to attack Iran again if there was any retaliation.",
      "\u201cThere will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department has doubled the number of emergency evacuation flights it is providing for American citizens wishing to leave Israel, ordered the departure of nonessential staff from the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon and is stepping up travel warnings around the Middle East because of concerns Iran will retaliate against U.S. interests in the region for the weekend strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
      "In an alert sent to all Americans worldwide and posted to its website on Sunday, the State Department warned all U.S. citizens abroad to exercise caution.",

      "\u201cGiven reports of regional hostilities, the U.S. Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region,\u201d the department said in its notice for Saudi Arabia.",

      "\u201cNegative sentiment toward U.S. foreign policy may prompt actions against U.S. or Western interests in Turkey,\u201d the statement said.",

      "But even before the U.S. airstrikes on Iran were made public by President Donald Trump on Saturday evening in Washington, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem had announced the start of evacuation flights for private Americans from Israel.",
      "Sixty-seven American citizens left Israel on two government flights bound for Athens, Greece, on Saturday and four more evacuation flights to Athens had been planned for Sunday, according to an internal State Department document seen by The Associated Press. However, due to the closure of Israeli airspace after the U.S. airstrikes on Iran three of those four flights were canceled, according to an update from the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.",
      "The embassy is planning to reschedule the canceled flights to Athens on Monday when it expects as many as six evacuation flights to the Greek capital, along with a chartered flight to Rome and another flight to Cyprus, according to the update.",
      "In addition to the flights that have already left, a cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 American citizens, including several hundred Jewish youngsters who had been visiting Israel on an organized tour, arrived in Cyprus, according to the document.",
      "It also said the evacuation of non-essential personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Erbil is continuing. Those staffers had been ordered to leave even before Israel began its military operation in Iran more than a week ago. \u201cAs part of our ongoing effort to streamline operations, additional personnel departed Iraq on June 21 and 22,\u201d the department said. \u201cThese departures represent a continuation of the process started on June 12.\u201d",
      "As of Saturday, more than 7,900 Americans had asked for assistance in leaving Israel and more than 1,000 had sought help in leaving Iran, where the U.S. has no diplomatic presence, the document said.",
      "There are roughly 700,000 Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, in Israel and many thousands of Americans, most of them dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, in Iran. It was not clear how many Americans had successfully made it out of Iran through overland routes, although the document said more than 200 had entered neighboring Azerbaijan as of Saturday since the conflict began.",
      "After the U.S. strikes in Iran, security officers at all U.S. embassies and consulates have been instructed to conduct reviews of their post\u2019s security posture and report back to the State Department by late Sunday.",

      "A landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling 10 years ago this month, on June 26, 2015, legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. The Obergefell v",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling 10 years ago this month, on June 26, 2015, legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S.",
      "The Obergefell v. Hodges decision followed years of national wrangling over the issue, during which some states moved to protect domestic partnerships or civil unions for same-sex partners and others declared marriage could exist only between one man and one woman.",
      "In plaintiff James Obergefell's home state of Ohio, voters had overwhelmingly approved such an amendment in 2004 \u2014 effectively mirroring the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of same-sex couples. That laid the political groundwork for the legal challenge that bears his name.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the lawsuit, the people involved and the 2015 ruling's immediate and longer term effects:",
      "Obergefell and John Arthur, who brought the initial legal action, were long-time partners living in Cincinnati. They had been together for nearly two decades when Arthur was diagnosed with ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2011. Obergefell became Arthur's caregiver as the incurable condition ravaged his health over time.",
      "When in 2013 the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages, the pair acted quickly to get married. Their union was not allowed in Ohio, so they boarded a plane to Maryland and, because of Arthur's fragile health, married on the tarmac.",
      "It was when they learned their union would not be listed on Arthur's death certificate that the legal battle began. They went to court seeking recognition of their marriage on the document and their request was granted by a court. Ohio appealed and the case began its way up the ladder to the nation's high court.",
      "A Democrat, Obergefell made an unsuccessful run for the Ohio House in 2022.",
      "Rick Hodges, a Republican, was director of the Ohio Department of Health from August 2014 to 2017. The department handles death certificates in the state. Before being appointed by then-Gov. John Kasich, Hodges served five years in the Ohio House. Acquainted through the court case, he and Obergefell have become friends.",
      "The lawsuit eventually titled Obergefell v. Hodges argued that marriage is guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, specifically the due process and equal protection clauses.",
      "The litigation consolidated several lawsuits brought by same-sex couples in Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee who had been denied marriage licenses or recognition for their out-of-state marriages and whose cases had resulted in conflicting opinions in federal circuit courts.",
      "In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the right to marry is fundamental, calling it \u201cinherent in the liberty of the person,\u201d and therefore protected by the Constitution. The ruling effectively nullified state-level bans on same-sex marriages, as well as laws declining to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions.",
      "The custody, property, tax, insurance and business implications of of the decision have also had sweeping impacts on other areas of law.",
      "Same-sex marriages surged in the immediate wake of the Obergefell decision, as dating couples and those already living as domestic partners flocked to courthouses and those houses of worship that welcomed them to legalize their unions. Over the ensuing decade, the number of married same-sex couples has more than doubled to an estimated 823,000, according to June data compiled by the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.",
      "Not all Americans supported the change. Standing as a national symbol of opponents was Kim Davis, a then-clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, who refused to issue marriage licenses on religious grounds. She was briefly jailed, touching off weeks of protests as gay marriage foes around the country praised her defiance.",
      "Davis, a Republican, lost her bid for reelection in 2018. She was ordered to pay thousands in attorney fees incurred by a couple unable to get a license from her office. She has appealed in July 2024 in a challenge that seeks to overturn Obergefell.",
      "As he reflects of the decision\u2019s 10th anniversary, Obergefell has worried aloud about the state of LGBTQ+ rights in the country and the possibility that a case could reach the Supreme Court that might overturn the decision bearing his name.",
      "Eight states have introduced resolutions this year urging a reversal and the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly at its meeting in Dallas earlier this month in favor of banning gay marriage and seeing the Obergefell decision overturned. Meanwhile, more than a dozen states have moved to strengthen legal protections for same-sex married couples in case Obergefell is ever overturned.",
      "In 2025, about 7 in 10 Americans \u2014 68% \u2014 said marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid, up from 60% in May 2015.",

    "story": [
      "Fred Smith, the FedEx Corp. founder who revolutionized the express delivery industry, has died, the company said",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Fred Smith, the FedEx Corp. founder who revolutionized the express delivery industry, has died, the company said. He was 80.",
      "FedEx started operating in 1973, delivering small parcels and documents more quickly than the post office could. Over the next half-century, Smith, a Marine Corp. veteran, oversaw the growth of a company that combined air and ground service and became something of an economic bellwether because so many other companies rely on it.",
      "Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx grew into a global transportation and logistics company that averages 17 million shipments per business day. Smith stepped down as CEO in 2022 but remained executive chairman.",
      "Smith, a 1966 graduate of Yale University, used a business theory he came up with in college to create a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub, a \"hub and spokes\" system, as it became known.",
      "The company also played a major role in the shift by American business and industry to a greater use of time-sensitive deliveries and less dependence on large inventories and warehouses.",
      "Smith once told The Associated Press that he came up with the name Federal Express because he wanted the company to sound big and important when in fact it was a start-up operation with a future far from assured.",
      "At the time, Smith was trying to land a major shipping contract with the Federal Reserve Bank that didn't work out.",
      "In the beginning, Federal Express had 14 small aircraft operating out of the Memphis International Airport flying packages to 25 U.S. cities.",
      "Smith's father, also named Frederick, built a small fortune in Memphis with a regional bus line and other business ventures. Following college, Smith joined the U.S. Marines and was commissioned a second lieutenant. He left the military as a captain in 1969 after two tours in Vietnam where he was decorated for bravery and wounds received in combat.",
      "He told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that everything he did running FedEx came from his experience in the Marines, not what he learned at Yale.",
      "Getting Federal Express started was no easy task. Overnight shipments were new to American business and the company had to have a fleet of planes and a system of interconnecting air routes in place from the get-go.",
      "Though one of Memphis' best-known and most prominent citizens, Smith generally avoided the public spotlight, devoting his energies to work and family.",
      "Despite his low profile, Smith made a cameo appearance in the 2000 movie \u201cCastaway\u201d starring Tom Hanks. The movie was about a FedEx employee stranded on an island.",
      "\u201cMemphis has lost its most important citizen, Fred Smith,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, citing Smith's support for everything from the University of Memphis to the city's zoo. \u201cFedEx is the engine of our economy, and Fred Smith was its visionary founder. But more than that, he was a dedicated citizen who cared deeply about our city.\"",
      "Smith rarely publicized the donations he and his family made, but he agreed to speak with AP in 2023 about a gift to the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation to endow a new scholarship fund for the children of Navy service members pursuing studies in STEM.",
      "\u201cThe thing that\u2019s interested me are the institutions and the causes not the naming or the recognition,\u201d Smith said at the time.",
      "Asked what it means to contribute to the public good, he replied:",
      "\u201cAmerica is the most generous country in the world. It\u2019s amazing the charitable contributions that Americans make every year. Everything from the smallest things to these massive health care initiatives and the Gates Foundation and everything in between,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you\u2019ve done well in this country, it\u2019s pretty churlish for you not to at least be willing to give a pretty good portion of that back to the public interest. And all this is in the great tradition of American philanthropy.\u201d",

      "A Wrigley Field staffer had a heat-related medical issue right after Saturday's game, according to a spokesman for the Cubs. He was tended to by medical personnel and walked off the field on his own.",
      "The Cubs set up cooling and misting stations throughout Wrigley to help fans with the heat on Saturday, along with additional emergency personnel. The team had similar plans in place for Sunday, along with bringing in a city bus to use as a cooling station on the street.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Republican proposal that would shift some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states would violate the chamber\u2019s strict rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- In another blow to the Republicans\u2019 tax and spending cut bill, the Senate parliamentarian has advised that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states \u2014 a centerpiece of GOP savings efforts \u2014 would violate the chamber\u2019s rules.",
      "While the parliamentarian's rulings are advisory, they are rarely, if ever, ignored. The Republican leadership was scrambling on Saturday, days before voting is expected to begin on President Donald Trump's package that he wants to be passed into law by the Fourth of July.",
      "The loss is expected to be costly to Republicans. They have been counting on some tens of billions of potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to help offset the costs of the $4.5 trillion tax breaks plan. The parliamentarian let stand for now a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans, up to age 65, to receive food stamp aid.",
      "\u201cWe will keep fighting to protect families in need,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which handles the SNAP program.",
      "\u201cThe Parliamentarian has made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts,\u201d she said.",
      "The committee chairman, Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., said in a statement that his team is examining options that would comply with Senate rules to achieve savings and \"to ensure SNAP serves those who truly need it while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "The parliamentarian's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks as staff works through the weekend, often toward midnight, to assess the 1,000-page proposal. It all points to serious trouble ahead for the bill, which was approved by the House on a party-line vote last month over unified opposition from Democrats and is now undergoing revisions in the Senate.",
      "At its core, the goal of the multitrillion-dollar package is to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire if Congress fails to act. It also adds new ones, including no taxes on tips or overtime pay. To help offset the costs of lost tax revenue, the Republicans are proposing cutbacks to federal Medicaid, health care and food programs \u2014 some $1 trillion. Additionally, the package boosts national security spending by about $350 billion, including to pay for Trump's mass deportations, which are running into protests nationwide.",
      "Trump has implored Republicans, who have the majority in Congress, to deliver on his top domestic priority, but the details of the package, with its hodgepodge of priorities, is drawing deeper scrutiny.",
      "All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package, as approved by the House, would add at least $2.4 trillion to the nation's red ink over the decade and leave 10.9 million more people without health care coverage. Additionally, it would reduce or eliminate food stamps for more than 3 million people.",
      "The parliamentarian's office is tasked with scrutinizing the bill to ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, which is named after the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and bars many policy matters in the budget reconciliation process now being used.",
      "Late Friday, the parliamentarian issued its latest findings. It determined that Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee\u2019s proposal to have the states pick up more of the tab for covering food stamps \u2014 what Republicans call a new cost-sharing arrangement \u2014 would be in violation of the Byrd Rule.",
      "Many lawmakers said the states would not be able to absorb the new requirement on food aid, which has long been provided by the federal government. They warned many would lose access to SNAP benefits used by more than 40 million people.",
      "Initially, the CBO had estimated about $128 billion in savings under the House\u2019s proposal to shift SNAP food aid costs to the states. Cost estimates for the Senate\u2019s version, which made changes to the House approach, have not yet been made publicly available.",
      "The parliamentarian's office rulings leave GOP leaders with several options. They can revise the proposals to try to comply with Senate rules or strip them from the package altogether. They can also risk a challenge during floor voting, which would require the 60-vote threshold to overcome. That would be unlikely in the split chamber with Democrats opposing the overall package.",
      "The parliamentarian's latest advice also said the committee's provision to make certain immigrants ineligible for food stamps would violate the rule. It found several provisions from the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which is led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to be in violation. They include one to provide $250 million to Coast Guard stations damaged by fire in 2025, namely one on South Padre Island in Texas.",
      "Still to come are some of the most important rulings from the parliamentarian. One will assess the GOP's approach that relies on \u201ccurrent policy\u201d rather than \u201ccurrent law\u201d as the baseline for determining whether the bill will add to the nation's deficits.",
      "Already, the parliamentarian delivered a serious setback Thursday, finding that the GOP plan to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was a core proposal coming from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, would be in violation of the Byrd Rule.",
      "The parliamentarian has also advised of violations over provisions from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would rollback Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards on certain vehicles and from the Senate Armed Services Committee to require the defense secretary to provide a plan on how the Pentagon intends to spend the tens of billions of new funds.",
      "The new work requirements in the package would require many of those receiving SNAP or Medicaid benefits to work 80 hours a month or engage in other community or educational services.",

      "Salt Lake City police had said Gamboa brought an assault-style rifle to the rally and was allegedly moving toward the crowd with the weapon raised when a safety volunteer for the event fired three shots, wounding Gamboa and killing a nearby demonstrator, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo.",
      "Gamboa did not fire his rifle and it is unclear what he intended to do with it. His father Albert Gamboa, told The Associated Press earlier this week that his son was \u201can innocent guy\u201d who was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d",
      "Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street. The volunteer has not been publicly identified as investigators have worked to determine who was at fault.",
      "Judge James Blanch said in the release order that Gamboa must live with his father and is forbidden from possessing firearms. The conditions terminate after two months or if criminal charges against him are pursued, Blanch wrote.",
      "Gamboa's attorney, Greg Skordas, did not immediately respond to a telephone message left for him seeking comment.",
      "Police said the day after the shooting that witnesses reported seeing Gamboa lift the rifle when he was ordered to drop it and that instead he began running toward the crowd. He fled but was arrested nearby, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo\u2019s death.",
      "Salt Lake City police said in a statement the next day that Gamboa \u201cknowingly engaged in conduct ... that ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member.\u201d",
      "But three days after Gamboa was booked into jail, with no formal charges filed, police acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the shooting remained uncertain. They issued a public appeal for any video footage related to the shooting or Gamboa, and said detectives were still trying \u201cto piece together exactly what happened.\u201d",
      "The volunteer who confronted Gamboa was described by event organizers as a military veteran whose role as a safety volunteer was to maintain order.",
      "Experts say it\u2019s extremely rare for such individuals, often called safety marshals, to be armed. They typically rely on calm demeanor, communication and relationships with police and protesters to help keep order, said Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor.",
      "Police said the permit for the protest did not specify that there would be armed security.",
      "Protest organizers have not said whether or how the safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo was trained or explained why he was armed. All attendees, including those in safety roles, were asked not to bring weapons, according to Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for the 50501 Movement. Parker's organization on Thursday said it was disassociating from a local chapter of the group that helped organize the Utah protest.",
      "The demonstration involving some 18,000 people was otherwise peaceful. It was one of hundreds nationwide against President Donald Trump\u2019s military parade in Washington, which marked the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump\u2019s birthday.",

      "House and Senate Republicans are taking different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.",
      "Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.",
      "The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.",
      "While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:",
      "The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.",
      "The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.",
      "The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.",
      "Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.",
      "The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.",
      "The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that\u2019s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.",
      "The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.",
      "The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.",
      "And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.",
      "Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.",
      "The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.",
      "The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.",
      "The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.",
      "The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.",
      "Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.",
      "Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.",
      "\u201cThis needs a lot of work. It\u2019s really concerning and I\u2019m really surprised by it,\u201d he said. \u201cRural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.\u201d",
      "The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.",
      "The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.",
      "The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.",
      "Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.",

      "As the United Nations marks its 80th anniversary, its humanitarian operations are increasingly in doubt as its top donor \u2014 the United States \u2014 has cut funding under the Trump administration and some other top Western countries have followed suit",
      "KAKUMA, Kenya -- At a refugee camp in northern Kenya, Aujene Cimanimpaye waits as a hot lunch of lentils and sorghum is ladled out for her and her nine children \u2014 all born while she has received United Nations assistance since fleeing her violence-wracked home in Congo in 2007.",
      "\u201cWe cannot go back home because people are still being killed,\u201d the 41-year-old said at the Kakuma camp, where the U.N. World Food Program and U.N. refugee agency help support more than 300,000 refugees.",
      "Her family moved from Nakivale Refugee Settlement in neighboring Uganda three years ago to Kenya, now home to more than a million refugees from dozens of conflict-hit east African countries.",
      "A few kilometers (miles) away at the Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement, fellow Congolese refugee Bahati Musaba, a mother of five, said that since 2016, \u201cU.N. agencies have supported my children\u2019s education \u2014 we get food and water and even medicine,\u201d as well as cash support from WFP to buy food and other basics.",
      "This year, those cash transfers \u2014 and many other U.N. aid activities \u2014 have stopped, threatening to upend or jeopardize millions of lives.",
      "As the U.N. marks its 80th anniversary this month, its humanitarian agencies are facing one of the greatest crises in their history: The biggest funder \u2014 the United States \u2014 under the Trump administration and other Western donors have slashed international aid spending. Some want to use the money to build up national defense.",
      "Some U.N. agencies are increasingly pointing fingers at one another as they battle over a shrinking pool of funding, said a diplomat from a top donor country who spoke on condition of anonymity to comment freely about the funding crisis faced by some U.N. agencies.",
      "Such pressures, humanitarian groups say, diminish the pivotal role of the U.N. and its partners in efforts to save millions of lives \u2014 by providing tents, food and water to people fleeing unrest in places like Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, or helping stamp out smallpox decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most abrupt upheaval of humanitarian work in the U.N. in my 40 years as a humanitarian worker, by far,\u201d said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. humanitarian aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cAnd it will make the gap between exploding needs and contributions to aid work even bigger.\u201d",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked the heads of U.N. agencies to find ways to cut 20% of their staffs, and his office in New York has floated sweeping ideas about reform that could vastly reshape the way the United Nations doles out aid.",
      "Humanitarian workers often face dangers and go where many others don\u2019t \u2014 to slums to collect data on emerging viruses or drought-stricken areas to deliver water.",
      "The U.N. says 2024 was the deadliest year for humanitarian personnel on record, mainly due to the war in Gaza. In February, it suspended aid operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have detained dozens of U.N. and other aid workers.",
      "Proponents say U.N. aid operations have helped millions around the world affected by poverty, illness, conflict, hunger and other troubles.",
      "Critics insist many operations have become bloated, replete with bureaucratic perks and a lack of accountability, and are too distant from in-the-field needs. They say postcolonial Western donations have fostered dependency and corruption, which stifles the ability of countries to develop on their own, while often U.N.-backed aid programs that should be time-specific instead linger for many years with no end in sight.",
      "In the case of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning WFP and the U.N.\u2019s refugee and migration agencies, the U.S. has represented at least 40% of their total budgets, and Trump administration cuts to roughly $60 billion in U.S. foreign assistance have hit hard. Each U.N. agency has been cutting thousands of jobs and revising aid spending.",
      "\u201cIt's too brutal what has happened,\u201d said Egeland, alluding to cuts that have jolted the global aid community. \u201cHowever, it has forced us to make priorities ... what I hope is that we will be able to shift more of our resources to the front lines of humanity and have less people sitting in offices talking about the problem.\u201d",
      "With the U.N. Security Council's divisions over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East hindering its ability to prevent or end conflict in recent years, humanitarian efforts to vaccinate children against polio or shelter and feed refugees have been a bright spot of U.N. activity. That's dimming now.",
      "Aside from the cuts and dangers faced by humanitarian workers, political conflict has at times overshadowed or impeded their work.",
      "UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees, has delivered an array of services to millions \u2014 food, education, jobs and much more \u2014 in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as well as in the West Bank and Gaza since its founding in 1948.",
      "Israel claims the agency's schools fan antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiment, which the agency denies. Israel says Hamas siphons off U.N. aid in Gaza to profit from it, while U.N. officials insist most aid gets delivered directly to the needy.",
      "\u201cUNRWA is like one of the foundations of your home. If you remove it, everything falls apart,\u201d said Issa Haj Hassan, 38, after a checkup at a small clinic at the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.",
      "UNRWA covers his diabetes and blood pressure medication, as well as his wife\u2019s heart medicine. The United States, Israel's top ally, has stopped contributing to UNRWA; it once provided a third of its funding. Earlier this year, Israel banned the aid group, which has strived to continue its work nonetheless.",
      "Ibtisam Salem, a single mother of five in her 50s who shares a small one-room apartment in Beirut with relatives who sleep on the floor, said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for UNRWA we would die of starvation. ... They helped build my home, and they give me health care. My children went to their schools.\u201d",
      "Especially when it comes to food and hunger, needs worldwide are growing even as funding to address them shrinks.",
      "\u201cThis year, we have estimated around 343 million acutely food insecure people,\u201d said Carl Skau, WFP deputy executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a threefold increase if we compare four years ago. And this year, our funding is dropping 40%. So obviously that\u2019s an equation that doesn\u2019t come together easily.\u201d",
      "Billing itself as the world's largest humanitarian organization, WFP has announced plans to cut about a quarter of its 22,000 staff.",
      "One question is how the United Nations remains relevant as an aid provider when global cooperation is on the outs, and national self-interest and self-defense are on the upswing.",
      "The United Nations is not alone: Many of its aid partners are feeling the pinch. Groups like GAVI, which tries to ensure fair distribution of vaccines around the world, and the Global Fund, which spends billions each year to help battle HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have been hit by Trump administration cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Some private-sector, government-backed groups also are cropping up, including the divisive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been providing some food to Palestinians. But violence has erupted as crowds try to reach the distribution sites.",
      "No private-sector donor or well-heeled country \u2014 China and oil-rich Gulf states are often mentioned by aid groups \u2014 have filled the significant gaps from shrinking U.S. and other Western spending.",
      "The future of U.N. aid, experts say, will rest where it belongs \u2014 with the world body's 193 member countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to take that debate back into our countries, into our capitals, because it is there that you either empower the U.N. to act and succeed \u2014 or you paralyze it,\u201d said Achim Steiner, administrator of the U.N. Development Program.",

    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",
      "\"He lived for The Doors,\" said Krieger. \"I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over.\"",
      "Manzarek died in 2013.",
      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",
      "To the end, The Doors were an improvisational group. One of their best-known songs grew out of another tune they were jamming on in a session. \"We were goofing around,\" said Densmore, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" morphed into \"Riders on the Storm.\" It would be Morrison's final recording.",
      "At the Whisky a Go Go every month, Krieger (now 79) has been playing a Doors album in its entirety. Densmore (80) recently sat in on drums.",
      "\"Well, these two geezers are still breathing,\" Densmore laughed. \"Keith and Mick are 80 and they're out there pumpin'. There's other roads!\"",

The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",

      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Dixon says he later received a raise that the lawsuit suggests was part of an attempt to keep him quiet.",
      "He said the fear of his character dying kept him quiet as intended.",

      "The lawsuit describes several other alleged assaults. In one of those alleged instances, the suit claims Perry climbed into bed with Dixon, uninvited, and groped him while Dixon was staying in a guest room at Perry's house.",
      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "story": [
      "R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after prison staff gave him \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him\" and was later forcibly removed from a hospital against medical advice, his lawyer alleged in a statement to CBS News and a federal court filing.",
      "The disgraced singer's lawyer, Beau Brindley, is requesting that a judge move him to home detention from the North Carolina prison where he is serving his sentences.",
      "\"Mr. Kelly's life is in danger and the threat comes from Bureau of Prisons officers whose duty is to protect him,\" Brindley wrote in a court motion filed Monday.",
      "He alleges the federal Bureau of Prisons is \"seeking to kill\" Kelly \"to cover up crimes committed in the investigation of his case.\"",
      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News show Kelly's legal team discuss the emergency release request with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien in back-and-forth filings this week. \"Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will,\" Julien said in a response filed Monday. \"Undeterred, Kelly now asks this Court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy.\"",
      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge struck down sweeping Trump administration orders that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health research grants because they were linked to topics like diversity, gender identity and vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday.

      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",

      "Flaws cited by a trial brief brought by the groups included the lack of a definition for what qualified as banned \"DEI studies\" and NIH Acting Director Dr. Matthew Memoli having spent only minutes deciding which grants and funding opportunities to cut.",

    "summary": "Real estate company Compass claims Zillow is illegally undermining competition by banning property listings if they don't appear on Zillow within 24 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:56:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Social Security is dipping into its trust fund to pay current retirees, with spending outpacing its revenue from payroll taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a cut of between 19% to 23% to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "story": [
      "Tariffs are pushing up the cost of materials that are frequently used in home renovation projects, leading some homeowners to reconsider fixing up their residences.",
      "Suppliers of materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum, have already hiked prices for builders. Sixty percent of homebuilders say suppliers have either already raised prices or intend to, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo's April 2025 Housing Market Index. They attribute the price hikes to the Trump administration's sweeping levies on the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "Extra costs for materials can add up quickly, leading to a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project, according to the NAHB.",
      "Pre-ordering materials, before prices rise, is one way to save on roofing supplies such as shingles, according to Connecticut-based builder David Perotti, founder of Fine Home Contracting. He told CBS News that he saved a \"few thousand dollars\" on behalf of a client by ordering the roofing shingles early.",
      "Most materials that are used to build homes in the U.S. are imported, Perotti explained. For example, one-quarter of the country's available lumber supply comes from Canada, and could be subject to a 15% levy.",
      "Steel and aluminum are integral to building roofs, homes' plumbing systems, electrical equipment and HVAC systems.",
      "Tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum took effect earlier this month\u00a0and can apply to everything from coil roofing nails to metal flashing used to prevent leaks.",
      "Perotti's advice to homeowners looking for a refresh is to press pause on purchasing new appliances, and opt for a fresh paint job, which can go a long way toward making a home look new again.",
      "\"If you were to do one project, painting is usually really nice to freshen things up,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Perotti is also urging his clients to budget up to an additional 30% for extra, tariff-related costs on materials, particularly those that can go into remodeling bathrooms.",
      "Another tip is to work with materials suppliers to lock in prices when possible, even before materials become available. As far as repairs go, Perotti's advice is to prioritize fixing exterior damage, which can quickly lead to a home's degradation and cause more problems.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases.

      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",

    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",

      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",

      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January.

Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",

      "Kraft Heinz, the manufacturer of foods such as Jell-O, Capri Sun and Kool-Aid, said in an online statement that 10% of its products contain the dyes and that it has invested in removing the colors or replacing them with natural colors.",
      "Kraft Heinz replaced artificial dyes in its Kraft Mac & Cheese product in 2016, while some other products, including Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never had dyes, the company said. Kraft Heinz's announcement comes amid a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to root out artificial dyes from the nation's food supply and instead replace them with natural dyes.",
      "\"The vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we've been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C (Food, Drug & Cosmetic) colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" said Pedro Navio, North America president at Kraft Heinz in the company's statement.",

      "A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a \"heightened threat environment in the United States\" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.",
      "The bulletin, first obtained by CBS News on Sunday morning, June 22, does not note any current specific threats, but warns that \"low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks.\"",
      "While there are no known threats, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said, \"It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict.\"",
      "\"The ongoing Israel-Iran conflict brings the possibility of increased threat to the homeland in the form of possible cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes,\" Noem said in a statement Sunday.",
      "The bulletin notes that U.S. law enforcement \"has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" and warns \"the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets.\"",
      "The bulletin also warns, \"The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against the United States.\"",
      "The bulletin, which has now been officially shared with the public by the Department of Homeland Security, is the type of comprehensive threat assessment designed to communicate information directly to the public about threats and about \"resources for how to stay safe during the heightened threat environment.\"",
      "Multiple sources tell CBS News that intelligence analysts began crafting this document earlier this month. It's gone through many iterations, with plans to publish following any escalation in the conflict overseas or intervention by the United States.",
      "It comes after the U.S. launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday evening, an operation that President Trump said aimed to stop \"the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\" The president warned Iran not to retaliate and to work toward a peace deal in its war with Israel.

At least 24 have also been killed in Israel, and hundreds wounded, in Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, according to estimates from the Israeli military. The conflict has played out as Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza continues.",
      "\"The Iranian Government has declared the United States complicit for Israel's attack, and will almost certainly condemn direct US involvement in the conflict,\" said U.S. officials in Sunday's bulletin.",
      "They additionally cautioned that the Israel-Iran conflict \"could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,\" citing violent incidents in recent months targeting Jewish groups and institutions around the country.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider a religious rights case brought by a former Louisiana inmate who is seeking to sue Louisiana prison officials for money damages for shaving his dreadlocks in violation of his religious beliefs.",
      "The high court will review a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that said the former inmate, Damon Landor, could not seek monetary damages against the officials in their individual capacities under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.",
      "Landor is a devout Rastafarian who pledged to \"let the locks of the hair of his head grow,\" known as the Nazarite Vow. Landor upheld that pledge for nearly 20 years, until he was nearly finished with a five-month prison sentence in Louisiana.",
      "For the first four months of his incarceration, the two facilities where Landor was housed allowed him to keep his hair long or under a \"rastacap.\" But that changed after Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center for the final three weeks of his sentence. Once there, Landor told an intake guard that he was a practicing Rastafarian and handed over proof of his religious accommodations, as well as a copy of a 2017 decision from the 5th Circuit that found Louisiana's policy of cutting Rastafarians' hair violated RLUIPA, according to court filings.",
      "But two guards ultimately handcuffed Landor to a chair, held him down and had his head shaved, according to papers filed with the Supreme Court.",
      "Landor filed a lawsuit against the prison officials after he was released and brought numerous claims, including under the RLUIPA. But a federal judge agreed to dismiss the case, finding that the law does not allow for damages against individual state officials.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the 5th Circuit affirmed that decision, ruling that while it \"emphatically\" condemned Landor's treatment, a prior decision in the circuit required it to hold that he could not seek money damages from officials in their individual capacities for violations of RLUIPA.",
      "The full 5th Circuit refused to reconsider the case, with 11 judges voting not to rehear it and six voting in favor.",
      "The case follows a Supreme Court decision from December 2020 in which it unanimously held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RLUIPA's sister statute, allows litigants to obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.",
      "Lawyers for Landor argued that Congress enacted the two laws to provide meaningful protection for religious liberty, and denying litigants the opportunity to seek damages for violations of RLUIPA would render that promise empty.",
      "Louisiana officials said in court papers that the allegations raised in Landor's appeal are \"antithetical to religious freedom and fair treatment of state prisoners,\" and condemned them \"in the strongest possible terms.\" But they urged the Supreme Court to turn away his appeal and said the state amended its prison grooming policy to prevent other inmates from being treated as Landor was.",

      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "summary": "The judge acknowledged in her ruling that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him.",
    "story": [
      "A Tennessee judge on Sunday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. But he is not expected to be allowed to go free.",
      "At his June 13 detention hearing, prosecutors said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would take Abrego Garcia into custody if he were released on the criminal charges, and he could be deported before he has a chance to stand trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release. The U.S. government has already filed a motion to appeal the judge's release order.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday that Abrego Garcia \"will never go free on American soil.\"",
      "Holmes acknowledged in her ruling Sunday that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him. But the judge wrote that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and \"a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial.\"",
      "Holmes wrote that the government failed to prove that Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, that he posed a danger to the community or that he would interfere with proceedings if released.",
      "\"Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego Garcia's\u00a0release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges that his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify the deportation mistake after the fact.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Rob McGuire, argued on June 13 that the likely attempt by ICE to try to deport him was one reason to keep him in jail.",
      "But Holmes said then that she had no intention of \"getting in the middle of any ICE hold.\"",
      "\"If I elect to release Mr. Abrego, I will impose conditions of release, and the U.S. Marshal will release him.\" If he is released into ICE custody, that is \"above my pay grade,\" she said.",
      "The judge suggested that the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security could work out between themselves whether the government's priority is to try him on the criminal charges or deport him. No date has been set for the trial.",
      "Will Allensworth, an assistant federal public defender representing Abrego Garcia at the detention hearing, told Holmes that \"it's not necessarily accurate that he would be immediately deported.\"",
      "A 2019 immigration judge's order prevents Abrego Garcia, who had been living in Maryland, from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, Allensworth said in court. That's because he faces a credible threat from gangs there, according to court papers.",
      "The government could deport him to a third country, but immigration officials would first be required to show that third country was willing to keep him and not simply deport him back to El Salvador, Allensworth said.",
      "The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Although officers suspected possible smuggling, he was allowed to go on his way with only a warning.",
      "At the detention hearing, McGuire said cooperating witnesses have accused Abrego Garcia of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims. Although he is not charged with such crimes, McGuire said they showed Abrego Garcia to be a dangerous person who should remain in jail pretrial.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the U.S. government deported Abrego Garcia and the Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate his return amid mounting public pressure.",
      "Chris Newman, an attorney who represents Abrego Garcia's family, previously told CBS News, \"The Trump administration is very invested in making this a referendum on the immigration debate, which, as you know, has become coarsened and polarized.\"",
      "\"And that is one way to look at it. And I think certainly a lot of people view it that way. I don't view it that way. I view this as a core constitutional order case, a core due process case,\" Newman said. \"And it just so happens that a Salvadoran immigrant is defending bedrock constitutional protections for all of us.\"",
      "Most people in ICE custody who are facing criminal charges are not kept in the U.S. for trial but deported, Ohio State University law professor C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "The U.S. will likely try to deport Abrego Garcia quickly without going before an immigration judge, the professor said. The government would not need a conviction to deport him because Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"The legal standard is laxer,\" Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. \"The government's argument is on stronger legal footing.\"",
      "However an immigration judge rules, the decision can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. And the board's ruling can then be contested in a federal appeals court.",

    "summary": "Operation Midnight Hammer included seven B-2 Spirit bombers, 125 total aircraft and more than 75 precision-guided weapons, the Joint Chiefs chairman said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senior Pentagon officials revealed new details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying it was the \"largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history\" and inflicted \"extremely severe damage and destruction\" to the targets.",
      "\"This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman, said in a briefing at the Pentagon on Sunday morning detailing the strikes against the Iranian nuclear sites at\u00a0Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "Caine said the mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, included seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew east from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to Iran. Another group of B-2s flew west over the Pacific to act as decoys \u2014 news reports emerged over the course of the day Saturday that a group of the bombers were headed to the U.S. base in Guam.",
      "Meanwhile, the 18-hour flight east by the bombers that would drop payloads on Iran required multiple in-flight refuelings as the planes crossed the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The bombers met up with U.S. fighter jets and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East, executing a \"complex, tightly timed maneuver,\" Caine said.",
      "Map shows Iran targets, Operation Midnight Hammer flight path",
      "Caine spoke in front of a map showing the flight path of the aircraft, and the timeline of key events in the operation:",
      "At about 5 p.m. ET Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a U.S. submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets at the site in Isfahan. As the bombers approached their targets, the U.S. deployed \"several deception tactics, including decoys,\" and fighter jets cleared the airspace ahead of them, checking for enemy aircraft and surface-to-air missiles.",
      "\"We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,\" Caine said.",
      "At about 6:40 p.m. ET, or 2:10 a.m. in Iran, the lead B-2 dropped two \"bunker-buster\" bombs known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, on the site at Fordo. Over the next 25 minutes, Caine said, a total of 14 MOPs would be dropped on targets at Fordo and Natanz. The Tomahawk missiles landed at Isfahan after bombs were dropped on the two other sites. Caine said no shots were fired at the planes as they left Iranian airspace.",
      "\"Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission, we retained the element of surprise,\" Caine said.",
      "\"More than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission,\" Caine said, including the B-2 bombers, fighter jets, refueling planes and surveillance aircraft. More than 75 precision-guided weapons were used in the attack, Caine noted.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said, noting that a full assessment will take time.",
      "The chairman warned Iran against taking any retaliatory action for the strikes.",
      "\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice,\" Caine said. \"We will defend ourselves.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack \"an incredible and overwhelming success.\"",
      "\"The order we received from our commander in chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear,\" Hegseth said at the briefing alongside Caine. \"We devastated the Iranian nuclear program, but it's worth noting that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.\"",
      "He added: \"The operation President Trump planned was bold, and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back. When this president speaks, the world should listen.\"",
      "\"Our B-2s went in and out \u2026 and back without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001, and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced Saturday evening that the U.S. had launched strikes against Iran. He said in a national address later Saturday night that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "Flanked by Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House, the president described the strikes as a \"spectacular military success\" and warned of \"far greater\" attacks if Iran does not \"make peace.\"",
      "\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill, most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,\" he said. \"There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made his final decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday aboard M1 during a call with Hegseth. The defense secretary advised Mr. Trump it was time to strike or abort the mission, after which the president gave the green light, according to a White House official.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the timing of Mr. Trump's decision.",
      "Mr. Trump was already leaning toward approving the strikes on Thursday, when White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he would decide \"within two weeks,\" the official said.",
      "According to the official, Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East, had told Mr. Trump in the weeks leading up to the strike that the Iranians were not serious about a nuclear deal.",

      "Prior to his address, the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that a \"full payload of BOMBS\" was dropped on the \"primary site\" Fordo. The president also said all U.S. planes made it safely out of Iranian airspace.",

      "Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13. Iran has responded with missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities.",
      "But in a follow-up social media post following his national address, Mr. Trump said that \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.\"",

      "What we know so far about the U.S. strikes",
      "Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used to strike Fordo early Sunday local time, with each of those B-2s armed with U.S.-produced\u00a0\"bunker-buster\" bombs\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs \u2014 bombs so heavy that they could only be dropped by a B-2.",
      "At a Pentagon briefing Sunday morning, Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said seven B-2s from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri dropped a total of 14 MOPs against two nuclear target areas \u2014 \"the first-ever operational use of this weapon,\" he said. Caine said about two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles targeted the Isfahan site.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "He said Iran does not appear to have returned fire during the mission, which the U.S. dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer.",
      "Fordo, the site of a high-grade uranium enrichment facility\u00a0that international experts believe is key to Iran's nuclear program, is buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses. The MOP was considered to be the weapon with the best chance of destroying the Fordo facility.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the strikes \"an incredible and overwhelming success.\"",
      "\"We devastated the Iranian nuclear program, but it's worth noting that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people,\" Hegseth said at the briefing alongside Caine.",
      "The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically Saturday to say the strikes are all the U.S. plans and that regime change efforts are not planned, the sources said. Earlier this week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News that Mr. Trump opposed an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.",
      "Not all U.S. allies in the region who house U.S. troops that are part of U.S. Central Command were informed in advance of the coming U.S. plan to strike in Iran, according to diplomatic sources. Some of the allies were informed as the planes were in the air.",
      "The United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency stated in a social media post that it confirmed \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "What Israeli and Iranian officials are saying",
      "The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, two White House officials told CBS News. Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke following the strikes, the officials said. And in a video address, Netanyahu praised the president for conducting the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace. And tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength.\"",
      "In a press conference in Istanbul Sunday morning, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran condemned \"in the strongest terms the United States brutal military aggression against Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities.\"",
      "\"The warmongering and lawless administration in Washington is solely and fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far reaching implement- implications of its act of aggression,\" Araghchi said, adding that Iran would \"will never compromise over their independence and sovereignty.\"",
      "In a statement, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Sunday that the U.S., with its strikes, had \"practically placed itself at the forefront of aggression by directly attacking peaceful facilities.\"",
      "The IRGC vowed \"regrettable responses\" to the U.S. strikes, adding that \"the number, dispersion, and size of U.S. military bases in the region are not a strength, but have doubled their vulnerability.\"",
      "Araghchi said he would travel on Sunday to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"serious consultations,\" citing Iran and Russia's \"strategic partnership.\"",
      "In statements conveyed by Russia's state-run news agencies on Sunday, the Kremlin strongly condemned the U.S. attacks on Iran, calling them an irresponsible violation of international law that would significantly increase the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East.",
      "Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals from the U.S. attack, domestically amid a \"very high\" threat level and with the \"red line\" of the Iranian response doctrine now crossed, CBS News has learned.",
      "\"We're in unchartered territory,\" one U.S. intelligence official told CBS News, while speaking about potential Iranian threats to the U.S. homeland. \"We don't know how Iran will react to this because this is the highest rate of tension and conflict we've had in recent history.

      "Both Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the president for not seeking congressional authorization for the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement that Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to \"'end the endless foreign wars.'\"",
      "\"Tonight, he took steps that could drag the United States into another one, without consulting Congress, without a clear strategy, without regard to the consistent conclusions of the intelligence community, and without explaining to the American people what's at stake,\" Warner said.",
      "The events that led up to the surprise strikes",
      "Earlier Saturday, multiple U.S. officials had confirmed to CBS News that B-2 bombers had departed Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri en route to Guam. Multiple U.S. aerial refueling tankers were spotted on commercial flight trackers flying flight patterns consistent with escorting aircraft from the central U.S. to the Pacific. Sunday morning, Gen. Caine said that was a \"deception effort,\" known to very few, and that the B-2s involved in the strike departed separately on an eastward flight path.",
      "The U.S. strikes come after Araghchi met with European officials in Geneva Friday and said he was open to further dialogue.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" Araghchi said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "On Thursday, the president said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"within the next two weeks.\" One source told CBS News at the time that Mr. Trump \"believes there's not much choice. Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said earlier Saturday that the U.S. had begun evacuating Americans and green card holders out of Israel aboard assisted departure flights. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their accompanying immediate family members and lawful permanent residents, the State Department said prior to Mr. Trump's announcement of the strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House released photos of the Situation Room during the strikes. In the room with the president were Vance, Hegseth, Rubio, chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, White House general counsel David Warrington and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",

      "During his brief remarks, Mr. Trump was flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine would hold a news conference with updates on the situation Sunday morning at 8 a.m. ET. At the briefing, they confirmed American B-2 bombers dropped 14\u00a0\"bunker-buster\" bombs\u00a0known as GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, on two nuclear sites, and targeted the Isfahan site with about two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles.",
      "Iran's Atomic Energy Organization has confirmed the strikes, but said the attack would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program. In a statement, it called on the international community to condemn the attacks. Iran's main state TV channels have so far been\u00a0 downplaying the impact of the strikes, claiming the sites had already been evacuated and denying any damage to the Fordo uranium enrichment facility.",
      "Prior to Saturday's airstrikes, Iran had threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if it joined the Israeli offensive. An Iranian official had warned Wednesday that U.S. intervention would risk \"all-out war.\" Iran has launched missiles at Israel over the last week.",
      "In a Truth Social post following Saturday's address, Mr. Trump said any Iranian retaliation \"WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.\"",
      "Iran's foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said in a post on X that the U.S. \"has committed a grave violation\" of the United Nations Charter and international law.",
      "\"In accordance with the UN Charter and its provisions allowing a legitimate response in self-defense, Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" he said.",
      "3 Iranian nuclear sites targeted",
      "All three sites that were targeted Saturday evening are part of Iran's nuclear program. Fordo\u00a0is 300 feet underground and protected by a Russian-produced anti-missile system. It's a high-grade uranium enrichment plant that can hold about 3,000 centrifuges. Fordo has long been believed by nuclear weapons experts to be central to any effort by Iran to produce weapons-grade uranium because of its size, security and technical capacity.",
      "Natanz, which is about 135 miles southeast of Tehran, in Isfahan province, is the country's main enrichment site. It operates multiple cascades of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium. On June 13, Israel struck Natanz, and IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the United Nations Security Council Iran had confirmed the attack on Natanz and said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% was \"destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged.",
      "The Isfahan facility, about 80 miles south of Natanz, hosts thousands of nuclear scientists and is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a screenshot of a post on X from \"Open Source Intel\" that says: \"Fordow is gone.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out the strikes nine days after Israel launched its offensive on Iranian military and nuclear targets \u2014 an operation Mr. Trump said the U.S. was not involved with.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, according to the IAEA \u2014 though Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is only intended for peaceful purposes. Before Israel's initial strikes the IAEA noted in a classified report obtained by CBS News that Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60%, which remains a matter of serious concern. Uranium for civilian use is enriched to a much lower rate, between 3% and 5%.",
      "On Friday, the president said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \"wrong\" when she testified in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, and the White House said this week that Iran has everything it needs to build a nuclear weapon and a green light from Iran's supreme leader would enable Iran to ready a nuclear weapon within weeks. Mr. Trump said Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon. Gabbard was among the White House officials in the Situation Room monitoring the U.S. strikes Saturday.",

      "New satellite photos show the aftermath of the U.S. military strike\u00a0that dropped multiple 30,000-pound \"bunker-buster\" bombs on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and hit two other key locations in Iran's nuclear program.",
      "The stealth U.S. mission, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" struck three nuclear facilities in Iran \u2014 Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan \u2014 in the early hours of Sunday local time.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing Sunday that seven B-2 Spirit bombers each carried two of the bombs known as GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs. Over 25 minutes, a total of 14 MOPs were dropped on two target areas at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles from a U.S. submarine targeted the Isfahan site, he said.",
      "He said it was the first time those massive bombs have ever been used in an operation.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "Satellite photos show impact of strikes on Fordo",
      "Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, taken Sunday after the strikes, show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried about 300 feet down. They can be compared to images of the same location taken before the strikes.",
      "A layer of ash caused by the airstrikes can be seen across a large swath of the area.",
      "The images by Maxar show several large diameter holes or craters on the top of the ridge over the underground complex.",
      "Additionally, several of the tunnel entrances that lead to the underground facility appear blocked by dirt following the strikes.",
      "Asked at the briefing whether any of Iran's nuclear capability remains, Caine said, \"I think (battle damage assessment) is still pending, and it would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there.\"",
      "Iran has yet to offer a damage assessment of the site. The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post that it had seen \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "In a statement on Sunday to the U.N. Security Council, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said his team was unable to assess the underground damage at Fordo. Following the attacks, he said there's a \"window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy.\"",
      "\"If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi said.",
      "Craters, destroyed buildings in Isfahan and Natanz",
      "At Isfahan, which was targeted by about a dozen Tomahawk missiles, satellite images from Sunday show extensive building damage across the facility, compared to images taken June 16. The Israeli military had also heavily bombed Isfahan in recent days",
      "Grossi told the UN Security Council that affected buildings include some related to the uranium conversion process. Entrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit, the IAEA director general said.",
      "At the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, a satellite image captured Sunday by Maxar shows an approximately 5.5-meter diameter hole or crater in the dirt directly over part of the underground military complex.",
      "Natanz had been previously damaged by the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13.",
      "Grossi confirmed Sunday that the fuel enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit again, with the U.S. confirming that it used ground-penetrating munitions. He said Iran has informed the nuclear watchdog there has been no increase in off-site radiation levels following the attacks. However, bombing nuclear facilities \"could result in radioactive releases with grave consequence,\" Grossi warned, urging \"maximum restraint.\"",
      "U.S. military used decoys and deception in attack",
      "President Trump announced Saturday evening that the U.S. had launched strikes against Iran. He said in a\u00a0national address later Saturday night\u00a0that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday that the U.S. used decoy B-2 bombers, which flew west over the Pacific from their base in Missouri earlier Saturday, to throw off the Iranians from the true plans. The bombers actually involved in the strike took off on an eastward path, refueling several times on their way to the Middle East.",
      "Hegseth added that the U.S. used other methods of deception to protect the B-2 bombers that dropped the 14 \"bunker-buster\" bombs. He said the tactics helped the U.S. drop the bombs without tipping off Iran's fighter jets or its air missile systems.",
      "\"Our B-2s went in and out \u2026 and back without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way, it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001, and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday and said what happens next \"depends on what Iran chooses to do.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, while warning Iran that closing the crucial Strait of Hormuz would be a \"suicidal\" move for the regime.",
      "Rubio, appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" urged Iran to pursue diplomacy after the U.S. carried out what the Pentagon called the largest B-2 operation in U.S. history in an effort to cripple Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Rubio said the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks on Iran unless \"they mess around.\"",
      "Rubio said the U.S. mission \"was not an attack on Iran, it was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move. This was designed to degrade and/or destroy three nuclear sites related to their nuclear weaponization ambitions, and that was delivered on yesterday.\"",
      "Transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "\"What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next,\" Rubio said. \"If they choose the path of diplomacy, we're ready. We can do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people, and good for the world. If they choose another route, then there will be consequences for that.\"",
      "President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, Rubio said, noting that the U.S. pushed Iran to make a deal to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions before the strikes.",
      "\"We're prepared, right now, if they call right now and say, 'We want to meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that,\" Rubio said.",
      "The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman that is used to transport about 20% of oil used around the world.",
      "Rubio declined to say whether the U.S. would take military action if Iran closes the strait, or whether the U.S. would consider attacks on oil facilities by Iran's proxy militias as direct acts by the regime: \"I'm not going to take options away from the president, that's not something we're talking about right now in terms of being immediate.\"",
      "Rubio said closing the strait would affect the U.S., but it would have \"a lot more impact on the rest of the world,\" particularly on China.",
      "\"That would be a suicidal move on [Iran's] part, because I think the whole world would come against them if they did that,\" Rubio said.",
      "Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former head of U.S. Central Command and a CBS News contributor, said the U.S. would be able to clear the strait if Iran lined it with underwater mines.",
      "\"The Iranians do have the capability to mine the Strait of Hormuz. We have very good plans to clear that if we had to do it. We work on those plans all the time,\" McKenzie told Brennan later in the show. \"It would be a blow to world commerce, for a period of time, but at the end, the strait would be cleared, and I'm pretty confident the Iranian navy would all be sunk at the end of that operation.\"",
      "The U.S. operation on Saturday, which the Trump administration named \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, causing what the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said was \"extremely severe damage and destruction.\" The Pentagon acknowledged that capturing a complete assessment of the operation's effectiveness will take time.",
      "Brennan pressed Rubio on what specific intelligence pushed the president to make the decision to strike Iran. In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified before Congress that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, testimony Mr. Trump declared \"wrong.\" Rubio said Iran, ahead of the strikes, had \"everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" and pointed to assessments by the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.",
      "\"Here's what the whole world knows. Forget about intelligence,\" Rubio told Brennan. \"What the IAEA knows, they are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a civil nuclear program. So why would you enrich uranium at 60% if you don't intend to use it to one day take it to 90 and build a weapon? Why are you developing ICBMs?\"",
      "Brennan asked Rubio whether the U.S. will defend other nations in the Middle East if Iran launches attacks on their soil in response. Rubio said that's why U.S. bases \u2014 and about 40,000 U.S. troops \u2014 are positioned across the Middle East.",
      "\"Well, that's exactly why they're there,\" he said, adding, \"All those bases are there because they're afraid that Iran will attack them.\"",
      "Rubio insisted that the U.S. will defend Americans, including U.S. soldiers on military bases, from Iran and its proxies.",
      "\"They'll attack us, is what they're threatening to do,\" he said. \"So we'll defend our people, obviously. We'll defend our people. Well, they'll attack our bases. And those are our bases, and we're going to defend our personnel, and we're prepared to do that.\"",
      "Rubio said he didn't want to forecast what the U.S. might do if Iran retaliates.",
      "\"There are no planned military operations right now against Iran unless they mess around and they attack Americans or American interests, then they're going to have a problem,\" he said. \"Then they're going to have a problem, and I'm not going to broadcast what those problems are.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And today on Face the Nation, breaking news overnight, as President Trump delivers on his threat to use American firepower to bomb Iran nuclear sites. Is this a one-and-done mission, or has the U.S. further escalated tensions in the already volatile Middle East conflict?",
      "It took American B-2s loaded with bunker-busting bombs in a surprisingly timed mission that President Trump says shows the might and strength of the U.S. military.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just how successful were those strikes? Can the U.S. keep from getting further involved?",
      "This morning, Iran says they will respond and that the U.S. betrayed diplomacy. What's the threat to Americans, especially our troops serving in the Middle East? We will talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, plus Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and two House members with very different political ideologies united now when it comes to U.S. intervention in a war between Iran and Israel.",
      "All this and more is just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Following the U.S. bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran yesterday, Trump administration officials are breathing a sigh of relief that the highly classified bombing mission appears to have gone off without a hitch. But there is also concern now about what happens next when it comes to Iran.",
      "Operation Midnight Hammer involved top secret planning and a head fake, as two strike forces of B-2 bombers departed the U.S. flying in opposite directions late Friday night. On Saturday, defense officials confirmed to CBS News that there were in fact B-2s headed to Guam, flying west from their home in Missouri. But those were decoys.",
      "A separate fleet of B-2s departed from that same location heading east to the targets in Iran. Pentagon officials say the mission was an overwhelming success, but also concede it is too early to assess if Iran still has nuclear capability.",
      "Fourteen 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapons, or MOPs, dropped on an underground nuclear facility in Fordow and a key uranium enrichment site in Natanz. Additional American Tomahawks struck a third site at Isfahan.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that planes flew from the middle of America in Missouri overnight completely undetected over three of their most highly sensitive sites and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities.",
      "We believe that will have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the White House late last night, President Trump issued his own stern warning to Iran:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight's was the most difficult of them all by far and perhaps the most lethal.",
      "But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And those words, go after other targets, have led to confusion and some concern about what is next for the U.S. role in this very volatile crisis.",
      "Secretary of State and acting White House National Security Adviser Marco Rubio now joins us.",
      "Mr. Secretary, I know it has been an intense few hours, but, so far, it does not appear that Iran has yet retaliated against the United States. What intelligence do you have at this point about their capabilities to respond, the intent of their proxies? Is there any kind of command-and- control structure left to activate them?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Yes, well, we will see what Iran decides to do. I think they should choose the route of peace.",
      "We have been \u2013 we have done everything. We have bent over backwards, OK, to create a deal with these people. Steve Witkoff has traveled the world extensively, met with them \u2013 well, not even met with them, met through the Omanis with them and discussed back and forth.",
      "We even put an offer to them that they wanted elements of it in writing. And we offered it to them, a very generous offer, by the way. We have done every \u2013 and we're prepared right now. If they call right now and say, we want to meet, let's talk about this, we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning.",
      "His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically. But he also told them we had 60 days to make progress or something else was going to happen. And I think they thought they were dealing with a different kind of leader, like the kinds of leaders they have been playing games with for the last 30 or 40 years. And they found out that's not the case.",
      "So this mission was a very precise mission. It had three objectives, three nuclear sites. It was not an attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move. This was designed to degrade and/or destroy three nuclear sites related to their nuclear weaponization ambitions.",
      "And that was delivered on yesterday. What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next. If they choose the path of diplomacy, we're ready. We can do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people and good for the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: If they choose another route, then there will be consequences for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up on a phrase you just word \u2013 weaponization ambitions.",
      "Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the supreme leader had ordered weaponization?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's irrelevant.",
      "I see that question being asked in the media all the time. That's an irrelevant question. They have everything they need to build a weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but that is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. You know that.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it's not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it's not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That the political decision had not been made.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I know \u2013 well, I know that better than you know that. And I know that that's not the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm asking you whether the order was given.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You don't know what you're talking about. And the people who say that \u2013 it doesn't matter if the order was given. They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons.",
      "Why would you bury \u2013 why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would you bury six \u2013 why do they have 60 percent enriched uranium? You don't need 60 percent enriched uranium.",
      "The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60 percent are countries that have nuclear weapons\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 because they can quickly make it 90. They have all the elements. They have \u2013 why are they \u2013 why do they have a space program? Is Iran going to go to the moon?",
      "No. They're trying to build an ICBM, so they can one day put a warhead on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but that's a question \u2013 that's a question \u2013 that's a question of intent. And you know, in the intelligence assessment, that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold state and use this leverage.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you know what the intelligence assessment says? How do you know what the intelligence assessment says?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm talking about the public March assessment. And that's why I was asking you if you know something more from March, if an order was given.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that \u2013 but that's also an inaccurate representation of it. That's an inaccurate representation of it. That's not how intelligence is read. That's not how intelligence is used.",
      "Here's what the whole world knows. Forget about intelligence, what the IAEA knows. They are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 for a civil nuclear program. So why would you enrich uranium at 60 percent\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 if you don't intend to one day use it to take it to 90 and build a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why are you \u2013 why are you developing ICBMs? Why do you have 8,000 short-range missiles and 2,000 to 3,000 long \u2013 mid-range missiles that you continue to develop? Why do you do all these things?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They have everything they need for a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They have the delivery mechanisms. They have the enrichment capability. They have the highly enriched uranium that is stored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's all we need to see\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, and that's \u2013 so it was the\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially in the hands of a regime that's already involved in terrorism and proxies and all kinds of things that are on \u2013 they are the source of all instability in the Middle East.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And no one's disputing \u2013 no one's disputing that. I'm not doing that here. And they were censured at the IAEA for that enrichment and for violating their nonproliferation agreements.",
      "I was simply asking if we had intelligence that there was an order to weaponize, because you have said weaponization ambitions, which implies they weren't doing it.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, we have intelligence that they have everything they need to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that's more than enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Can \u2013 I want to ask you, on the policy front, there are personnel throughout the Middle East from the United States in Bahrain, in Kuwait, and other bases.",
      "If those countries are attacked by Iran because of their association with the United States, will the United States defend them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's exactly why they're there. That's a great point, actually.",
      "Do you know why we have bases in Bahrain and Qatar and UAE and in all these places? All of those bases are there because those countries are afraid that Iran will attack them. If Iran was not a threat to the region, if the Iranian regime \u2013 because let me be clear, I'm talking about the Iranian people. If the regime was not a threat to the region, we wouldn't have to have any of these bases.",
      "Those bases are there because those countries are petrified that these \u2013 that the Iranian Shia clerics that run that country will attack their country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the United States defend them if they are?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: As you know, they've got a very difficult history.",
      "Well, that's why we're there. That's why we're there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, we will defend them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But they'll attack us, is what they're threatening to do. So we'll defend our people, obviously. We'll defend our people. Well, they'll attack our bases. And those are our bases, and we're going to defend our personnel. We're prepared to do that.",
      "But we'll do more than just defend. We'll impose costs on Iran if they attack American personnel, whether they do it directly, or whether they do it through some of these proxies that they try to hide behind. And that includes the Houthis, so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Another proxy of theirs.",
      "So \u2013 but let's hope they don't choose that route. Let's all hope that they actually decide, OK, let's go negotiate, because we want a diplomatic and peaceful solution. We have achieved our objectives. We're ready to negotiate this in a peaceful, in a diplomatic way. We've been prepared to do that for days.",
      "They are the ones that played games\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 as they have done for 40 years, as they have done to multiple presidents. They tried to play games with President Trump, and they see what happens.",
      "This is not a game-playing president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: When he says he's going to do something, he will do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you saying here you want to de-escalate when you are talking about diplomacy.",
      "You are looking for Iran to pick up that offer that was put on the table you mentioned by Steve Witkoff. Can you just clarify, does that mean the U.S. would still allow for Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it does not enrich on its own soil?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But that \u2013 but that's never been an issue. There's countries all over the world that have a civil nuclear program. No one here is saying that Iran can't\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's still the offer on the table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. That's always been there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Any country in the world has a right to have a civil nuclear program. What they don't have a right to do is to enrich it at 60 percent, hide it under a mountain\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 and develop long-range and short-range and mid- range missiles and sponsor terrorist proxies all over the world. They don't have a right to do that, and that's what they've been doing.",
      "And no one's dealt with it, and it's continued to linger. And they've played games with multiple presidents and multiple countries around the world, and they've gotten away with it for 40-something years. This is very simple. The president wants to resolve this diplomatically and peacefully. He gave them a chance to do that.",
      "They delayed. They had all these kind of delay tactics. They wouldn't even meet with us directly. We had to go through third countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is very simple. Let's meet directly. Let's work on agreements that we can \u2013 that are good for Iran, good for the Iranian people, in particular, good for the safety and security of the world and the United States.",
      "That's always been our preference. That continues to be our preference. But they're the ones that were playing games with this. And these are the consequences. We had to achieve those objectives. We had three objectives yesterday, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. We conducted a brilliant military operation under the command of President Trump, and obviously great credit to Secretary Hegseth and General Kurilla and General Caine and all of our - - all the airmen and phenomenal people in the U.S. military.",
      "No other military in the world could have done this. We achieved those objectives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. It was astounding.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What happens next is up to the regime, OK?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The regime wants peace, we're ready for peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They want to do something else, they're incredibly vulnerable. They can't even protect their own airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, clearly. Clearly, they could not.",
      "But what is the U.S. assessment of how much nuclear material at those sites was moved prior to the attack? There has been talk for days about bombing of Fordow.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, we \u2013 we don't \u2013 no one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran. I mean, the minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it, and they've targeted it and taken it out.",
      "So our assessment is, we have to assume that that's a lot of 60 percent enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan. And that really is the key. What they should do with that is, they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries around the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that.",
      "And what they should do is say, we're not going to have any enrichment capability in our country. Instead, what we're going to have is a civil nuclear program, like dozens of countries around the world have, where we build reactors that create electricity and we import enriched material.",
      "And we've made very generous \u2013 I'm not going to get into all the details of the offers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But there are other avenues here that would be acceptable to them, if that's what they wanted.",
      "If what they want is a civil, peaceful nuclear program, the route has always been there. The problem is that everything they're demanding has nothing to do with a peaceful program. They are all the things you would want if you want to retain the option of one day weaponizing the program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 which has been their clear intent. To me, that's indisputable. I have followed this issue for 15 years\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 including the intelligence on it for 15 years, OK? I have followed it.",
      "And the intelligence, these are assessments, and sometimes they've been wrong. I have seen them revised multiple times. These guys want a nuclear weapon one day. They do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, to that point\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And it isn't going to happen, not while Donald Trump is president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've said this is not about regime change, but you are describing a regime that you have said for decades, I mean, for upwards of 40 years, has chanted \"Death to America,\" has done all the things you just described.",
      "Isn't a diplomatic deal with them a lifeline? Aren't you offering to negotiate with the same people you're saying did all these things? So, therefore, are you actually looking for regime change?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But that's not the point. Well, that misses the point. I don't like that they chant those things.",
      "But one thing is that they chant those things. Another thing is that they chant those things, and they have terror proxies are all over the world, and they have long-range missiles that can reach the United States one day, and they have the potential to be one step away from a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One day.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, well one day could be tomorrow. Could be a week from now. Could be a month from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You know, all it takes is the flip of a switch. By the way, they're not going to broadcast that to the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: By the time we figure out that they're doing it, you have all the pieces in place. OK?.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are there still targets you want to hit?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's like you have a loaded \u2013 a gun here and the ammunition. It only takes one second. We have other targets that we could hit, but we achieved our objective.",
      "The primary targets we were interested in are the ones that were struck tonight in devastating fashion,the ones that were struck, I guess, yes, tonight over there their time, in devastating fashion. And we've achieved that objective. There are no planned military operations right now against Iran unless, unless they mess around and they attack American or American interests.",
      "Then they're going to have a problem. Then they're going to have a problem. And I'm not going to broadcast what those problems are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But suffice it to say, know this. The United States flew halfway around the world, right into the heart of Iran, over their most sensitive locations. These things got rocked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And then we left, and we were out of their airspace, we were over the ocean before they figured out what had happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And there are plenty of other targets. We don't want to do that. That's not our preference. We want peace deals with them, and that's up to them to decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said defend American interests. Would the United States military take action to keep, for example, the transit point the Strait of Hormuz open? If there are attacks on oil installations, would the United States consider that a direct act by the state, even if it was carried out by a militia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to take options away from the president. That's not something we're talking about right now in terms of being immediate.",
      "But if they do that, the first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government, because they take \u2013 a lot of their oil comes through there. So they should be the first ones that are saying, if they mine the Straits of Hormuz, the Chinese are going to pay a huge price and every other country in the world is going to pay a huge price.",
      "We will too. It will have some impact on us. It will have a lot more impact on the rest of the world, a lot more impact on the rest of the world. That would be a suicidal move on their part, because I think the \u2013 the whole world would come against them if they did that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the Chinese and Russians stop trading with Iran?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You have to ask the Chinese and the Russians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You haven't' asked them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Probably not. I mean, they're getting \u2013 you know, they're \u2013 well, the Russians are getting a bunch of these \u2013 you know, these drones that they're using are coming from Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They're coming from Iran.",
      "So I saw the foreign minister, instead of meeting with Steve Witkoff, is headed to Moscow to meet with Putin, which was a prescheduled meeting, which is fine. You know, they can go meet. And you the \u2013 the Russians, at the end of the day, I mean, they buy drones from them.",
      "But, look, this is very simple. They \u2013 we want to have an agreement with them, a diplomatic agreement, in which they have a civil nuclear program, but are not enriching and don't have weapons-grade material or weapons- grade capabilities laying around. It's that simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's our interest here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who they trade with, who they deal with, those are other topics. Our objective here is very straightforward. They're not going to have a nuclear weapon. They're not even going to get close to a nuclear weapon. They're not even going to be in the neighborhood of a nuclear weapon, because these people are dangerous.",
      "This is the radical Shia clerics who run that country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And they are the source of all instability in the region, all of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're offering to negotiate with them.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Without this regime, there is no Hamas, there is no Hezbollah.",
      "Well, because we don't want them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but let me \u2013 but\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But that's the core objective.",
      "But the \u2013 no, no, but I'm going through the things they've done, because that's why they can't have a nuclear weapon, OK? They sponsor Shias.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, I'm just trying to\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I'm sorry. They sponsor these Shia militias, Hamas, Hezbollah, all these other terrorist groups. These people aren't getting \u2013 are never going to get anywhere close to a nuclear weapon, not while Donald Trump is president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For the Americans \u2013 for the Americans at home who are going, are we at war, you know, I'm trying to suss out some of the facts here.",
      "So why would \u2013 why would Iran agree to any peace deal if the United States has already pulled out of one that they had, as President Trump did in 2018, and now launched two surprise attacks? Both Israel and the United States have done so. There is such a massive trust deficit there. How could you possibly come to an agreement?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but the trust deficit started with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the trust deficit \u2013 the ones that shouldn't be trusted are the Iranians, because they're the ones that sponsor terrorism.",
      "Did they forewarn us before they blew up the embassy in Lebanon and killed over 200 American servicemen? Did they forewarn us before they built IEDs and blew the legs and arms off of American servicemen in Iraq? I mean, these are the people that are doing this forever. They're the ones that no one should trust.",
      "They're the ones that have lied about their nuclear program. They're the ones that have hidden things from the international organisms.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that sounds \u2013 all sounds like we're \u2013 but that all sounds like we're headed towards regime change or the desire to get these people out of power. Are you\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but \u2013 no, no, no, no, no.",
      "No, a serious foreign policy is one that's focused on identifying what our national interest is. You don't have to like the regime. There are a lot of regimes around the world that we don't like, OK? But, in this particular case, what we are focused on is not the changing of the regime, OK?",
      "That's up to the Iranian people if they want to do that, but that's not what we're focused on. Our national interest is about one thing, and that is Iran not getting anywhere near the capability to weaponize and have nuclear weapons. They're not going to get anywhere near that capability. The president has made that clear from day one.",
      "Our preference for solving that problem, that very specific problem\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 is through diplomacy. We've said that. We've given it every opportunity. They played games. They tried delay tactics. They're trying delay tactics now on the Europeans because of the snapback provisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When did the president make this\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And you talked about the JCPOA. That was a crazy deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When did the president make this decision? Because he said he was giving two more weeks of diplomacy on Friday, and, on Friday, these jets took off.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the president retains the opportunity to pull out of this at any moment, including 10 minutes before.",
      "But the president ordered options. The president \u2013 look, the decision, in my view, was made when he wrote a letter to the supreme leader and he said over the next 60 days we want to do a deal with you and solve this problem of nuclear weaponization and we want to do it peacefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: If, after 60 days, we don't see progress or it isn't solved, we have other alternatives. He made that very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Secretary\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I think what some people struggling with here is that we today have a president who does what he says he's going to do, and that's what happened here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, hopefully, the Iranian regime got that message.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 we're going to hit a commercial break, so I have to wrap you there. Thank you very much for your time.",

      "(SIRENS BLARING)",
      "DEBORA PATTA: Two hours later, Iran retaliated with a barrage of at least 30 ballistic missiles. At least three broke through. Buildings were reduced to rubble in Haifa and here in Tel Aviv.",
      "This scene has been cordoned off after a direct hit from Iran's retaliatory strike, some of the worst damage in this area. The missile decimated an apartment block and homes in this neighborhood, but there were no fatalities. Israel has said its main goal was to destroy Iran's nuclear capability.",
      "As world attention is diverted to Iran, Gaza is sinking into an even greater catastrophe, with the Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting over 200 deaths in the past 48 hours alone. The injured wait to be treated on hospital floors. Children's screams fill the emergency rooms.",

      "We go to Erbil, Iraq, with Holly Williams.",
      "HOLLY WILLIAMS: Iran's foreign minister said this morning that the U.S. has committed a grave violation of international law and Iran has to respond.",
      "Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned last week that any U.S. military intervention would be met with irreparable harm. It's thought that he is now in hiding in a bunker. Now, U.S. military bases here in the Middle East are obvious targets for Iranian retaliation, and they are scattered across this region, along with around 40,000 American troops.",
      "A second carrier strike group is on its way to the Middle East to boost U.S. firepower. It is widely thought that Israel did not have the firepower to target the Fordow nuclear site, where Iran's been enriching uranium and which is buried inside a mountain. But now that the U.S. has bombed it, the question is, what comes next?",
      "One outcome is that Iran capitulates and agrees to give up its nuclear program. But another outcome is that Iran may be more motivated than ever before to develop nuclear weapons to protect itself from further attack. One Iranian lawmaker posted on social media overnight, apparently speaking to that possibility, saying \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Knowledge cannot be bombed.\"",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "And good morning to both of you gentlemen.",
      "I'll start with you, Congressman Massie.",
      "You know, I know \u2013 this is an unlikely pairing. You are on completely different ends of the political spectrum, but you both worked on this war powers resolution to prohibit U.S. forces from engage in hostilities against Iran without authorization from Congress. The president just blew right past that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): Well, you know, I think I represent part of the coalition that elected President Trump. We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East, and tired of wars in east \u2013 eastern Europe, and we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies and our infrastructure first. And so what Ro and I did, we did this last week when, you know, they were rattling the sabers, because we saw this coming. We put forward this war powers resolution.",
      "I've teamed up with Ro Khanna before on this, to his credit, when Joe Biden was president. We tried to rein in the executive and reassert Congress' authority \u2013 soul authority to declare war and to \u2013 and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Something we talked to other lawmakers about as well in the Senate, and I know there's efforts to support you, but the speaker of the House, who is from your own party, has really rejected this. He says, \"the Article One power of Congress really allows for the president to do this. It was a limited, necessary, targeted strike,\" he says.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973, but that's been misinterpreted. There were no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House.",
      "Look, Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening. Speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You haven't been briefed on any of the details.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back. And, frankly, we should have debated this war powers resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered, instead of staying on vacation and doing fundraisers and saying, oh, well, the president's got this under control, we're going to cede our constitutional authority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna, Congressman Khanna, and we didn't hear from the secretary, the explanation as to why now. We haven't heard that from anyone other than a reference to the president had a roughly 60-day timeline on diplomatic talks. But we also know he had more talks scheduled when Israel launched this attack. So, it's just \u2013 it's not exactly clear the emergency. You will be briefed, along with other members of Congress, Tuesday. What are the questions you have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, first of all, the tragedy in this country is that we keep entering these overseas wars. We triumphantly declare the mission is accomplished the day after. And then we're left with Americans burdening the consequences for decades.",
      "Now, Thomas is absolutely right in showing courage. I mean the headlines all across this country says, the United States enters war with Iran. He is actually representing a lot of the people in the MAGA base. People like Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Theo Von, who has had them on, who is saying, we don't want this war.",
      "And I heard your interview with Secretary Rubio. He's saying, well, we want a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We want to make sure that Iran can enrich uranium through civil purposes. Well, we had that. We had that in the JCPOA. And there was not a single violation that the IAEA found during that time.",
      "So, my question, I guess, is, now you're going to force Iran to go covertly into developing this nuclear material. Now you've put American troops at risk. Now you're wasting billions of our dollars because we're sending more troops to the Middle East. What did you accomplish, and why are you oblivious to the American people who are sick of these wars?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Congressman, are you open to the idea that there could be intelligence that is disclosed to you in this classified setting on Tuesday that could justify this, or is any military action, in your view, you know, war?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I'm always open to new intelligence, but the procedures should have been that Congress be briefed before we decided to enter war and that we actually had a vote on it. You had Tulsi Gabbard, who just months ago, the director of intelligence, saying that was not the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: The reality is, and \u2013 and we should just speak up, there are people who want regime change in Iran. And they are egging this president on to bomb. I hope cooler heads will prevail. We need to pass Thomas Massie and my war powers resolution to make it clear that we're not going to get further entrenched into the Middle East.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and, Congressman Massie, it's interesting because you were talking about a part of the party you represent. The secretary of state comes from a different part of that same party, as you know.",
      "And \u2013 and I did hone in on the question about intelligence, and wat it showed. He called it an ambition to weaponize. Weaponization ambition. That's different than they're making a nuclear weapon.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you open to intelligence and persuasion here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: I'm open as well. But, look, in the first Iraq war, the second Iraq war, and the war in Afghanistan, Congress first got the briefings. Congress met and debated. It should have been declarations of war, but at least they did an authorization of the use of military force. We haven't had that. This has been turned upside-down, this process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard from Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader, the Senator, saying it was a bad week for the isolationists. He was talking about Tucker Carlson and he was talking about Steve Bannon.",
      "Do you think that the president is making a choice here, or is he trying to have it both ways? Both saying, I'm going to please the hawks of the party by bombing, but them I'm going to say I want a peace deal and make the isolationists happy by saying, you know, I'm not committing to anything more than one and done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Well, I'll concede this, it was a good week for the neocons in the military industrial complex who want war all the time. I wouldn't call my side of the MAGA base isolationists. We are \u2013 we are exhausted. We are tired from all of these wars. And we're non- interventionists. I mean this is what \u2013 this was one of the promises. I mean are you going to call President Trump's campaign an isolationist campaign? What he promised us was, we would put America first. And I \u2013 and I think there are still voices in this administration, you've still got J.D. Vance, you've still got Tulsi Gabbard, you've still \u2013 RFK Jr., you've still got calmer heads that could prevail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They were not persuasive in this case, clearly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Well, somebody was persuasive. APAC is very persuasive, for instance, the Israeli lobby in Congress. If you \u2013 if you look at my colleagues' feeds now, there's \u2013 they all look the same. They're all tweeting the same message, that we've got to support Israel and we've got to do this.",
      "My question is, does, you know, three bombings and we're done with Iran's nuclear ambitions \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Is that the two weeks to slow the spread of 2025? Is this, you know, we were told two weeks to slow the spread then. Now we're told it's just going to take three bombings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: But what happens when Israel gets bombed again? Is \u2013 is Trump going to sit by and say, no, we're not going to further engage in this war?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I tried to get answers from the secretary on that question. But when you say the pro-Israel lobby, APAC, do you see a difference between Israel's interests and American interests?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Absolutely. Yes. I mean, look, the \u2013 Iran \u2013 the reality is, they don't have a missile that can reach the United States. They're not near to getting a missile that can reach the United States. I think this \u2013 what has happened, what has transpired this week has been planned for months. That \u2013 that, you know, this administration, and maybe even the administration prior to that, said, you go in and soften them up, take out their air defense capabilities, and then we'll send in the big bombers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Congressman Khanna, you \u2013 I know you have raised objections on this program in the past about Israel's operations in Gaza, for how it has conducted that war against Hamas. That was a different context. But now you very well may be asked to provide more weaponry to Israel to defend itself. Do you oppose that as well?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first, let me just say that it's a totally unfair smear to call people isolationists. The vast majority of Americans who don't world war and want diplomacy. Diplomacy and engagement is not isolationism. But, look, on Israel, I have supported aid and support defensively. And even the war powers resolution says that if Iran is striking Israel, they \u2013 you \u2013 we can provide defense so that Israel isn't hit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: What I opposed was giving Israel offensive weapons to go and kill more people in Gaza, I think that war needs to end.",
      "But I think the bottom line, Margaret, is, what have we achieved here? We have \u2013 we're going to push Iran to now be like Pakistan and North Korea, go in and try to develop a nuclear bomb covertly. We have put more American troops at risk. We're going to spend more resources put \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Going and getting more entrenched in the Middle East. And we've created a generation of hate. It's like, can this country learn?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We keep voting for people for president who say we're not going to get into wars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And then they keep getting pushed by the Washington beltway to get us into this mess.",

      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, no. Congress needs to authorize a war against Iran. This Trump war against Iran. We have not. Congress should be consulted with it. We were not. And Congress needs to be notified, not after the fact, but in advance. We were not.",
      "That's why I filed a war powers resolution that will ripen and be brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate this week. Senator Schumer is working with Leader Thune to make that happen.",
      "The United States should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. The Constitution is completely clear on it. And I am so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.",
      "The foreign minister of Israel said Friday night that its own bombing campaign had set the Iranian nuclear program back, quote, \"at least two or three years,\" closed quote. There was no urgency that suggested, while diplomatic talks were underway, that the U.S. should take this unilateral action by President Trump's orders yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the vice president was on another network earlier this morning and said, \"we are not at war with Iran. We are at war with Iran's nuclear program. There seems to be a lot of legal parsing on the definition of the word\"war\" here. What do you make of that description.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I think it's \u2013 it's B.S. And I think anybody hearing it would conclude the same thing. When you're \u2013 when you're bombing another nation, ask them if they think it's war. They do.",
      "Would we think it was war if Iran bombed a U.S. nuclear facility? Of course we would. And the U.S., you know, we \u2013 we've invaded two neighbors of Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, to topple their regimes since 2000. Those were wars.",
      "This is the U.S. jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump's urging without any compelling national security interests for the United States to act in this way, particularly without a debate and vote in Congress. We should not be sending troops and risking troops' lives in an offensive war without a debate in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just on the facts, though, the president has not authorized ground forces. In fact, he's said he really doesn't want to send in ground forces. When it came to what was just described to the public by the Pentagon, it was really characterized as limited in scope. It sounds like you believe those early hour descriptions are going to turn out to be false.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do. The war powers resolution says that a member of Congress can challenge the president if the president initiates hostilities against a foreign nation. It doesn't use the \u2013 even though the \u2013 the title is war powers resolution, the statute says if you initiate hostilities without congressional authorization, even a single member of the House or Senate can force a vote on the Senate floor.",
      "There is no doubt that the U.S. sending this massive set of Tomahawk missiles and B-2 bunker-busters on three Iranian nuclear sites is hostilities. Now again, some in the Senate may say this is great and we want to vote for it. I happen to think that getting into a third offensive war in the Middle East in the last 25 years is absolutely reckless and foolish. And I'm going to be doing everything I can to convince my colleagues of that. I may or may not succeed. But Congress should have the debate and vote on this before we escalate the risk to American troops, which this action has done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know that prior to this action Northern Command had already directed additional security measures on all U.S. military installations. You've got a lot of military installations in Virginia. What do you know about the threat to the homeland at this point?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: We're going to have a briefing Tuesday, Margaret, and I'll learn more then. But what I do know, I also have a lot of Virginians deployed in the Middle East. There are about 40,000 U.S. troops deployed all over the Middle East, sailors on Navy ships in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, folks in land bases in Syria and Iraq.",
      "And, yes, this action dramatically raises the risk to them. And the question is, for what? If the Iranian nuclear program \u2013 Vice President Vance says it's a war against their nuclear program. Of course, we had curtailed that diplomatically a few years ago until Donald Trump tore up the diplomatic deal. But even if you needed to wage war, when the Israeli foreign minister is saying we've set the nuclear program back at least two or three years. Why launch this strike, escalating risks to Americans and American troops over the weekend with no real discussion with Congress, no real debate before the American public. I don't want to be lied into another war in the way we were with Iraq in 2002.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the former commander of CENTCOM, which controls U.S. forces in the Middle East, our CBS News contributor, retired general, Frank McKenzie.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, General.",
      "And \u2013 and your former colleagues at CENTCOM extremely busy over these last few hours. From the operation as you've heard it described, what are the questions that \u2013 that come to your mind about \"Midnight Hammer\" and being able to assess its success?",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (Former Commander of CENTCOM): So, it looks like it was a successful operation from what we know now. It will take a little while to build the battle damage assessment. And that will come out here in the next \u2013 in the days ahead and we'll get a much better picture.",
      "But I think we've done significant damage. Significant, perhaps irreversible damage to the Iranian nuclear program. I think right now, though, at CENTCOM, everyone is focused on the next step. And the next step will be, will there be an Iranian response? What will that response look like? What can we do to defend our forces, our embassies, our citizens in the region. And what options can we give the president should we choose to respond as a result of an Iranian attack?",
      "So, they're extremely busy down there right now. And what \u2013 but one of the key things they want to do is, you want to make it very clear to Iran that we possess significant combat power in the theater and will be able to use it against them should they attack us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's \u2013 that's the hope that they don't do something. Are you surprised that there has been no retaliation in the past few hours? And where would you be looking as an areas of concern? There are a lot of Americans who have family members in the region.",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Absolutely, Margaret. So, for one thing, I think the Iranian decision making is a little crippled right now because of the loss of senior leaders. And as you're well aware, the Iranians don't have good succession planning. People tend to go into jobs and stay there for a long period of time while they enrich themselves and their families. So, cronyism is what \u2013 how you get to the top in their system, which is bad news if suddenly that person is no longer there. There's no one ready to step in. So, the supreme leader probably has trouble talking to people and getting his orders followed.",
      "Now, to your question about where they might strike. I think we're certainly vulnerable in Iraq. I think we're certain venerable in Syria. And I'm certain that Central Command has done all the things we need to do to harden ourselves against those potential attacks.",
      "The same for our other bases across the region. I don't know that it would be localized to the region, though. Iran has long harbored the desire to attack us in the United States. They typically have not been effective when they've done that. We've caught them in a couple of plots that are very public that you're well aware of. So, I think all those things are on the table. But it may take the Iranians a little while to work through this process because nobody's excited about going to a meeting in Iran right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're talking about some of the intelligence actions taken by the Mossad to convene some of these leaders and then kill them all at once.",
      "When it comes to what the secretary of state said earlier in this program, I asked him specifically if the U.S. would take military action to reopen the Strait of Hormuz if Iran tried to close it. We know that's been talked about, at least in the public space in Iran right now. What would that operation look like? Rubio said they're not exactly talking about it in this moment, but they are worried about the \u2013 the Iranians mining it.",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: The Iranians do have the capability to mine the Strait of Hormuz. But we have very good plans to clear that if we had to do it. We work on those plans all the time. It would be a \u2013 it would be a blow to world commerce for a period of time. But at the end, the Strait would be cleared. And I'm pretty confident the Iranian navy would all be sunk at the end of that operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the CIA \u2013 the former CIA director, Bob Gates, the former secretary of defense, who was on this program very recently. And I asked him about bombing the Iranian nuclear program. He said, when he had looked at it, he thought it would at best delay Iran's nuclear ambitions, not end them.",
      "You have looked at this problem set in great detail. Do you agree that military force is not enough to end the program?",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Ultimately, you need a policy decision from Iran to end the nuclear program. So, I think the secretary's right in that \u2013 in that \u2013 in that position. Now, if \u2013 if you don't get a policy decision from Iran, you've got to commit yourself perhaps to revisiting striking the nuclear program as the Iranians begin to spread out and \u2013 and \u2013 and continue to pursue the nuclear option.",
      "Here's the one thing, though. We have pretty good knowledge of what goes on in Iran. And that good knowledge is going to continue. So, they're not likely to be able to do something in secret that would suddenly creep up on us. We \u2013 we \u2013 we tend to keep very close track of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it comes up again and again and the concern, as we were talking about with our lawmakers, this creeping towards a broader war, this creeping towards America getting drawn into a war that Israel started to take out Iran's nuclear program, I'm not asking about the intent of the state itself, but what is the end goal here? How do you judge success? Have you even heard the Israeli government, or the U.S. government, say what success is?",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want Iran to possess a nuclear weapon. They are close to possessing a nuclear weapon. I heard all the exchanges back and forth with the \u2013 the other guests on your show this morning about how close they might or might not have been.",
      "But I think that's the one absolutely non-negotiable thing here. And you can get that through an Iranian policy decision and not pursue a nuclear weapon, or you can get that through removal of that capability to such a level that they can't do it.",
      "The second case is not the preferable case, obviously. But you \u2013 but there are ways to do this. And I \u2013 the one thing I would add about the strike that occurred here over the last few hours, it was carefully crafted, narrowly designed against the nuclear program to give Iran room to maneuver, diplomatic room to maneuver, if they want to seek a way out.",
      "So, I think that was very clever. Let's see what happens. The principal goal of Iranian state craft is today, as it has always been, survival of the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Under certain of these scenarios, if you go forward and the war widens, I think the survival of the Iranian state is very much on the table. And that's something they're going to want to avoid, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you were just saying, there's \u2013 there's no clear succession plan that the U.S. knew of, at least recently, and they can't get ahold of the boss, he's in a bunker. So, how do you actually get a policy decision, and then can orders actually be given?",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: So, it's a \u2013 it's a very difficult time for Iran right now, I \u2013 I \u2013 I acknowledge all your points. But the \u2013 the commander (ph) remains alive, at least as far as I know, he remains alive. He's probably having trouble having meetings. He's probably having trouble getting his orders followed. But he still asserts that he's in charge, as of a couple of days ago. And we \u2013 I don't think we've made any effort to strike him, nor have the Israelis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, right. And CBS had been reporting that President Trump advised the Israelis not to take out the supreme leader.",
      "We'll leave it there.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

    "summary": "Congress members offered a split response after President Trump's announcement that the U.S. had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Lawmakers across the political aisle offered a mixed response Saturday following President Trump's announcement that the\u00a0United States launched strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Immediately following Mr. Trump's announcement, Congressional Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz, backed Mr. Trump's actions, while a number of leading Democrats condemned his decision to launch the attack without consulting Congress.",
      "In a televised address Saturday night, the president described the strikes as a \"spectacular military success\" and said \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He warned of \"far greater\" attacks if Iran does not \"make peace.\"",
      "\"There is not another military in the World that could have done this,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Here's what lawmakers are saying:",
      "Many Republican lawmakers back U.S. strikes in Iran, but not all",
      "\"Good. This was the right call. The regime deserves it. Well done, President @realDonaldTrump,\" Sen. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on X.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a social media post that \"the military operations in Iran should serve as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that President Trump means what he says.\"",
      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" Johnson\u00a0said in the post. \"President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated. That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Cruz, who has backed of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets, said in a statement: \"As long as Iran was able to access and conduct activities at Fordow, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal. Tonight's actions have gone far in foreclosing that possibility, and countering the apocalyptic threat posed by an Iranian nuclear arsenal.\"",
      "Rep. Rick Crawford, Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Trump in a statement and said, \"I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days.\"",
      "The strikes announced by Mr. Trump Saturday evening further escalated the conflict between\u00a0Iran and Israel\u00a0that started June 13. Mr. Trump, on Wednesday,\u00a0was still mulling over\u00a0whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran.",
      "Before the announcement of the strikes, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was among the few Republicans who opposed the U.S. action, arguing on social media, \"This is not our fight.\"",
      "\"Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,\" she said in a post on X. \"There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.\"",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, reshared Mr. Trump's post on the strikes with a terse comment: \"not constitutional.\" Massie\u00a0introduced a resolution on Tuesday to prohibit U.S. involvement in the conflict. A few days earlier, he pointed out that the power to authorize use of military force rests with Congress, and\u00a0said\u00a0of the Israel-Iran conflict on X, \"This is not our war.  But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Massie said his resolution, introduced with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, seeks \"to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority, to declare war and to- and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war.\"",
      "Some Democrats say U.S. strikes in Iran are unconstitutional",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats agreed with Massie that the president should have consulted Congress, and on Saturday demanded that lawmakers be \"fully and immediately\" briefed on the attacks in a classified setting.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called for Congress to enforce the War Powers Act.",
      "\"President Trump must provide the American people and Congress clear answers on the actions taken tonight and their implications for the safety of Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"No president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy. Confronting Iran's ruthless campaign of terror, nuclear ambitions, and regional aggression demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity. The danger of wider, longer, and more devastating war has now dramatically increased.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while there is \"no question that Iran poses a serious threat to regional stability,\" the president's actions threaten to drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict \"without consulting Congress\" and \"without a clear strategy.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored Massie's resolution seeking to limit Mr. Trump's war powers, said in a statement early Sunday that Congress \"needs to come back to DC immediately to vote\" on the resolution \"to ensure there is no further conflict and escalation.\"",
      "\"Trump's strikes are unconstitutional and put Americans, especially our troops, at risk,\" Khanna said.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation,\" Khanna said \"the procedure should have been that Congress was briefed before we decided to enter war, and that we actually had a vote on it.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts\u00a0called on Congress\u00a0to return to Washington to vote on Massie and Khanna's legislation \"to stop this madness.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has introduced a similar resolution in the Senate, and told \"Face the Nation\" that he was \"so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.\"",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called Mr. Trump's decision to bomb Iran without congressional authorization \"is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.\"",
      "\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been trying to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. The extent of the president's authority to enter foreign conflicts without the approval of the legislative branch has been questioned in recent years. The last time Congress authorized the use of military force was in 2002, against Iraq. A year earlier, days after the 9/11 terror attacks, Congress passed a bill approving the use of military force against nations, organizations or individuals the president determines \"planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan urged Democratic colleagues in a post, \"Don't make another mistake in dragging our country into another war,\" and added, \"You can stop the President and the war mongers in Congress by signing on to our War Powers Resolution.\"",
      "In contrast to other Congressional Democrats, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said he fully supports the U.S. strikes on Iran.",
      "\"As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS,\" Fetterman said in a social media post. \"Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I'm grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.\"",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's on a tour this weekend in red Southern states, announced the news of the U.S. attacks on Iran to his supporters and was met the chants of \"no more war\" from the crowd.",
      "\"It is so grossly unconstitutional,\" Sanders said. \"All of you know that the only entity that can take this country to war is the U.S. Congress. The president does not have the right.\"",

Welcome back to \"Face the Nation,\" general and- and your former colleagues at CENTCOM extremely busy over these last few hours. From the operation as you've heard it described, what are the questions that- that come to your mind about Midnight Hammer and being able to assess its success?",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (RET.): So it looks like it was a successful operation, from what we know now, it'll take a little while to build the battle damage assessment, and that'll come out here in the next- in the days ahead, and we'll get a much better picture.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you were just saying, there's- there's no clear succession plan that the U.S. knew of at least recently, and they can't get a hold of the boss. He's in a bunker. So how do you actually get a policy decision and then can orders actually be given?",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: So it's a- it's a very difficult time for Iran right now. I- I acknowledge all your points, but- but the commanding remains alive, at least as far as I know. He remains alive. He's probably having trouble having meetings. He's probably having trouble getting his orders followed, but he still asserts that he's in charge as of a couple of days ago, and we, I don't think we've made any effort to strike him, nor have the Israelis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, right, and CBS had been reporting that President Trump advised the Israelis not to take out the supreme leader. We'll leave it there, and we'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 22, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" Democrat Ro Khanna joins us from San Francisco, and here, in studio, is Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie. Good morning to both of you, gentlemen. I'll start with you, Congressman Massie, you know, I know this is an unlikely pairing. You are on completely different ends of the political spectrum, but you both worked on this war powers resolution to prohibit US forces from engaging in hostilities against Iran without authorization from Congress. President just blew right past that.",
      "CONGRESSMAN THOMAS MASSIE: Well, you know, I think I represent part of the coalition that elected President Trump. We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East, and tired of wars in East- Eastern Europe. And we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies, and our infrastructure first. And so what Ro and I did, we did this last week, when, you know, they were rattling the sabers. Because we saw this coming, we put forward this War Powers Resolution. I've teamed up with Ro Khanna before on this, to his credit, when Joe Biden was President; we tried to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority, to declare war and to- and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Something we talked to other lawmakers about, as well, in the Senate, I know there's efforts to support you. But, the Speaker of the House, who is from your own party, has, really, rejected this. He says the Article I power of Congress, really, allows for the President to do this. It was a limited, necessary, targeted strike, he says.",
      "REP. MASSIE: Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973, but that's been misinterpreted. There were no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the Speaker of the House. Look, Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You haven't been briefed.",
      "REP. MASSIE: We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back. And, frankly, we should have debated this war powers resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered, instead of staying on vacation and doing fundraisers, and saying, oh, well, the President's got this under control, we're going to cede our constitutional authority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna- Congressman Khanna, and we didn't hear from the Secretary the explanation as to why now. We haven't heard that from anyone, other than a reference to the President had a, roughly, 60-day timeline on diplomatic talks, but we also know we had more talks scheduled when Israel launched this attack. So, it's just it's not exactly clear the emergency. You will be briefed along with other members of Congress Tuesday. What are the questions you have?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RO KHANNA: First of all, the tragedy in this country is that we keep entering these overseas wars. We triumphantly declare the mission is accomplished the day after, and then we're left with Americans bearing the consequences for decades. Now, Thomas is absolutely right, and showing courage. I mean, the headlines all across this country says the United States enters war with Iran. He is, actually, representing a lot of the people in the MAGA base. People like Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Theo Von, who has had them on, who's saying, we don't want this war. And I heard your interview with Secretary Rubio, he's saying, well, we want a peace deal. We want to make sure that Iran can enrich uranium through civil purposes. Well, we had that. We had that at the JCPOA, and there was not a single violation that the IAEA found during that time. So, my question, I guess, is, now you're going to force Iran to go covertly in developing this nuclear material. Now you put American troops at risk. Now you're wasting billions of our dollars because we're sending more troops to the Middle East. What did you accomplish? And why are you oblivious to the American people who are sick of these wars?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Congressman, are you open to the idea that there could be intelligence that is disclosed to you in this classified setting on Tuesday that could justify this? Or, is any military action, in your view, you know, war?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, I'm always open to new intelligence. But, the procedure should have been that Congress was briefed before we decided to enter war, and that we actually had a vote on it. You had Tulsi Gabbard, who, just months ago, the Director of Intelligence, saying that was not the case. The reality is, and we should just speak openly, there are people who want regime change in Iran. And they are egging this president on to bomb. I hope cooler heads will prevail. We need to pass Thomas Massie and my War Powers Resolution to make it clear that we're not going to get further entrenched into the Middle East.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Congressman Massie, it's interesting because you were talking about a part of the party you represent. The Secretary of State comes from a different part of that same party, as you know. And I did hone in on the question about intelligence, and what it showed. He called it an ambition to weaponize. Weaponization ambition. That's different than they're making a nuclear weapon.",
      "REP. MASSIE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you open to intelligence and persuasion here?",
      "REP. MASSIE: I'm open as well. But look, in the first Iraq war, the second Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan, Congress first got the briefings. Congress met and debated. It should have been declarations of war, but at least they did an authorization of use of military force. We haven't had that. This has been turned upside down- this process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard from Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader, the senator, say it was a bad week for the isolationists. He was talking about Tucker Carlson and he was talking about Steve Bannon. Do you think that the President is making a choice here, or is he trying to have it both ways, both saying I'm going to please the Hawks of the party by bombing, but then I'm going to say I want a peace deal and make the isolationists happy by saying, you know, I'm not committing to anything more than one and done?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Well, I'll concede this. It was a good week for the neocons and the military-industrial complex, who want war all the time. I wouldn't call my side of the MAGA base, isolationists. We are- we are exhausted. We are tired from all of these wars, and we're non-interventionists. I mean, this is what- this was one of the promises. I mean, are you going to call President Trump's campaign an isolationist campaign? What he promised us was we would put America first. And I think there are still voices in this administration. You've still got JD Vance, you've still got Tulsi Gabbard, you still- RFK Jr, you still got calmer heads that could prevail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They were not persuasive in this case, clearly.",
      "REP. MASSIE: Well, somebody was persuasive. AIPAC is very persuasive, for instance. The Israeli lobby in Congress. If you- if you look at my colleagues feeds now this- they all look the same. They're all tweeting the same message that we've got to support Israel and we've got to do this. My question is, does- you know, three bombings and we're done with- with Iran's nuclear ambitions, is that the two weeks to slow the spread of 2025? Is this- you know, we were told two weeks to slow the spread then, now we're told it's just going to take three bombings. But what happens when Israel gets bombed again? Is Trump going to sit by and say, no, we're not going to further engage in this war?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I tried to get answers from the Secretary on that question. But when you say the pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC, do you see a difference between Israel's interests and American interests?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, look- the- Iran, the reality is, they don't have a missile that can reach the United States. They're not near to getting a missile that can reach the United States. I think this- what has happened, what has transpired this week has been planned for months. That- that you know this administration, and maybe even the administration prior to that, said, you go in and soften them up, take out their air defense capabilities, and then we'll send in the big bombers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Congressman Khanna, I know you have raised objections on this program in the past about Israel's operations in Gaza, for how it has conducted that war against Hamas. That was a different context, but now you very well may be asked to provide more weaponry to Israel to defend itself. Do you oppose that as well?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, first, let me just say that it's a totally unfair smear to call people isolationists, the vast majority of Americans who don't want more war and want diplomacy. Diplomacy and engagement is not isolationism. But look on Israel, I have supported aid and support defensively. And even the War Powers resolution says that if Iran is striking Israel, they- you- we can provide defense so that Israel isn't hit. What I opposed was giving Israel offensive weapons to go kill more people in Gaza. I think that war needs to end. But I think the bottom line, Margaret, is, what have we achieved here? We have- we're going to push Iran to now be like Pakistan or North Korea going and try to develop a nuclear bomb covertly. We have put more American troops at risk. We're going to spend more resources put- going and getting more entrenched in the Middle East, and we've created a generation of hate. It's like, can this country learn? We keep voting for people for president who say we're not going to get into war, and then they keep getting pushed by the Washington beltway to get us into this mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Khanna, Congressman Massie, thank you. In a rare bipartisan meeting of the minds, at least on this issue, we'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 22, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us from Richmond, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you sit on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, but what we just heard from the Pentagon was that Congress was notified after the strike on Iran was concluded, after the US jets are back- in safety. Is this sufficient?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, no. Congress needs to authorize a war against Iran. This Trump war against Iran, we have not. Congress should be consulted with it. We were not. And, Congress needs to be notified, not after the fact, but in advance. We were not. That's why I filed a War Powers Resolution that will ripen and be brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate this week. Senator Schumer is working with Leader Thune to make that happen. The United States should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. The Constitution is completely clear on it. And I am so disappointed that the President has acted so prematurely. The Foreign Minister of Israel said Friday night that its own bombing campaign had set the Iranian nuclear program back, \"at least two or three years.\" There was no urgency that suggested, while diplomatic talks were underway, that the US should take this unilateral action by President Trump's orders yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Vice President was on another network earlier this morning, and said, \"We are not at war with Iran. We are at war with Iran's nuclear program.\" There seems to be a lot of legal parsing on the definition of the word war here. What do you make of that description?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I think it's, it's BS, and I think anybody hearing it would conclude the same thing. When- when you're bombing another nation, ask them if they think it's war. They do, would we think it was war if Iran bombed a US nuclear facility? Of course we would. And the US, you know, we've invaded two neighbors of Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, to topple their regimes since 2000. Those were wars. This is the US jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump's urging, without any compelling national security interests for the United States to act in this way, particularly without a debate and vote in Congress. We should not be sending troops, and risking troops' lives in an offensive war without a debate in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just on the facts, though, the President has not authorized ground forces. In fact, he said he really doesn't want to send in ground forces. When it came to what was just described to the public by the Pentagon, it was really characterized as limited in scope. It sounds like you believe those early hour descriptions are going to turn out to be false.",
      "SEN. KAINE: I do. The- the War Powers resolution says that a member of Congress can challenge the President, if the President initiates hostilities against a foreign nation. Doesn't use the- even though the title is War Powers resolution, the statute says if you initiate hostilities without congressional authorization, even a single member of the House or Senate can force a vote on the Senate floor. There is no doubt that the US sending this massive set of Tomahawk missiles and B-2 bombers and bunker busters on three Iranian nuclear sites is hostilities. Now, again, some in the Senate may say this is great and we want to vote for it. I happen to think that getting into a third offensive war in the Middle East in the last 25 years is absolutely reckless and foolish, and I'm going to be doing everything I can to convince my colleagues of that I may or may not succeed, but Congress should have the debate and vote on this before we escalate the risk to American troops, which this action has done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know that prior to this action, Northern Command had already directed additional security measures on all U.S. military installations. You've got a lot of military installations in Virginia. What do you know about the threat to the homeland at this point?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: We're going to have a briefing Tuesday, Margaret, and I'll learn more then, but what I do know, I also have a lot of Virginians deployed in the Middle East. There are about 40,000 U.S. troops deployed all over the Middle East, sailors on Navy ships in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, folks in land bases in Syria and Iraq, and yes, this action dramatically raises the risk to them. And the question is, for what? If the Iranian nuclear program \u2013 Vice President Vance says it's a war against their nuclear program. Of course, we had curtailed that diplomatically a few years ago until Donald Trump tore up the diplomatic deal. That even if you needed to wage war, when the Israeli Foreign Minister is saying we've set the nuclear program back at least two or three years, why launch this strike escalating risk to Americans and American troops over the weekend with no real discussion with Congress? No real debate before the American public? I don't want to be lied into another war in the way we were with Iraq in 2002.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor DeSantis of Florida was greeting passengers in his state who had boarded a Florida chartered flight from Israel to his state evacuating Americans. It was on Saturday that the U.S. ambassador first made public some of the details for Americans on how to get out of the country if they wanted to. The airspace is closed. What do you know in that foreign relations capacity about the security of our personnel in diplomatic posts, but also Americans who just want to get home and get back to safety?",
      "SEN. KAINE: We need to do everything we can, Margaret, to facilitate Americans wanting to return home from anywhere in the region. From Israel, where you know these these attacks from Iran pose serious risk to civilian lives, other countries in the region who feel at risk, we should do everything possible to bring them back. And I do suspect that the briefing that the entire Senate is going to get Tuesday is not only going to be about the military side of this, but how we are protecting our personnel in the region. President Trump started to voluntarily remove some U.S. personnel, State Department, USAID and other agencies from the region a couple of weeks ago. Not a mandatory evacuation, but the pace of voluntary departures was was picking up because we could see that President Trump was merging closer and closer and closer to violating what he told the American public and getting into another war in the Middle East.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State and acting White House National Security Adviser Marco Rubio now joins us. Mr. Secretary, I know it has been an intense few hours, but so far, it does not appear that Iran has yet retaliated against the United States. What intelligence do you have at this point about their capabilities to respond, the intent of their proxies? Is there any kind of command and control structure left to activate them?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Yeah, well, we'll see what Iran decides to do. I think they should choose the route of peace. We have been- we've done everything. We have bent over backwards, okay, to create a deal with these people. Steve- Steve Witkoff has traveled the world extensively, met with them- well not even met with them, met through the Omanis with them, and discussed back and forth. We even put an offer to them that they wanted elements of it in writing, and we offered it to them- very generous offer by the way. We've done- and we're prepared right now. If they call right now and say, we want to meet, let's talk about this. We're prepared to do that. The President's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with is to deal with this issue diplomatically, but he also told them we had 60 days to make progress or something else was going to happen. And I think they thought they were dealing with a different kind of leader, like the kinds of leaders they've been playing games with for the last 30 or 40 years. And they found out that's not the case. So this mission was a very precise mission. It had three objectives, three nuclear sites. It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move. This was designed to degrade and, or \u00a0destroy three nuclear sites related to their nuclear weaponization ambitions, and that was delivered on yesterday. What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next. If they choose the path of diplomacy, we're ready. We can do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people and good for the world. If they choose another route, then there will be consequences for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up on a phrase you just word, 'weaponization ambitions.' Are you saying there, that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme Leader had ordered weaponization?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: That's irrelevant. I see that question being asked in the media all the- that's an irrelevant question, they have everything they need to build the weapon--",
      "[CROSSTALK BEGINS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. You know that.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No its not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes it was--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No its not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The political decision had not been made.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --No, no. Well, I know that better than you know that, and I know that that's not the case. You not- you don't know what you're talking about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm asking you whether the order was given.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEC. RUBIO: And the people who say that- it doesn't matter the order was given. They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons. Why would you bury- why would you bury things in a mountain, 300 feet under the ground? Why would you bury six- why do they have 60% enriched uranium? You don't need 60% enriched uranium. The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% are countries that have nuclear weapons, because it can quickly make it 90. They have all the elements they have. Why are they- why do they have a space program? Is Iran going to go to the moon? No, they're trying to build an ICBM so they can one day put a warhead on it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but that's a question- that's a question- that's a question of intent. And you know, in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold state and use it as leverage--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: How do you know what the intelligence assessment says? How do you know what the intelligence assessment says--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I'm talking about the public March assessment. And that's why I was asking you, if you know something more from March if an order was given--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Well, but that's also an inaccurate representation of it- that's an inaccurate representation of it. That's not how intelligence is read. That's now how intelligence is used. Here's what the whole world knows. Forget about intelligence. What the IAEA knows they are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a- for a for a civil nuclear program. So why would you enrich uranium at 60%, if you don't intend to one day use it to take it to 90 and build a weapon? Why are you why are you developing ICBMs? Why do you have 8000 short range missiles and two to 3000 long- mid range missiles that you continue to develop? Why do you do all these things--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: They have everything they need for a nuclear weapon. They have the delivery mechanisms, they have the enrichment capability, they have the highly enriched uranium that is stored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: That's all we need to see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, and that's--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Especially in the hands of the regime that's already involved in terrorism and proxies and all kinds of things are on- they are the source of all the instability in the Middle East--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And no one's disputing- no one's disputing that. I'm not doing that here. And they were censured at the IAEA for that enrichment and for violating their non-proliferation agreements. I was simply asking if we had intelligence that there was an order to weaponize because you said 'weaponization ambitions,' which implies they weren't doing it--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Well, we have intelligence that they have everything they need to build a nuclear weapon, and that's more than enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Can- I want to ask you on the policy front, there are personnel throughout the Middle East, from the United States in Bahrain and Kuwait and other bases. If those countries are attacked by Iran because of their association with the United States, will the United States defend them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, that's exactly why they're there. That's a great point, actually. Do you know why we have bases in Bahrain and Qatar and UAE and in all these places? All those bases are there because those countries are afraid that Iran will attack them. If Iran was not a threat to the region, if the Iranian regime- because I'm not talking about the Iranian people, the regime was not a threat to the region, we wouldn't have to have any of these bases. Those bases are there because those countries are petrified that these- that the Iranian Shia clerics that run that country will attack their country--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the United States defend them if they are--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: As you know, they've got a very difficult history- well, that's why we're there. That's why we're there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So yes, we will defend them.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: They'll attack us, is what they're threatening to do. So we'll defend our people, obviously. We'll defend our people- well, they'll attack our bases, and those are our bases, and we're going to defend our personnel. We're prepared to do that, but we'll do more than just defend we'll impose costs on Iran if they attack American personnel, whether they do it directly, or whether they do it through some of these proxies that they try to hide behind, and that includes the Houthis so- another proxy of theirs. So- but let's hope they don't choose that route. Let's all hope that they actually decide, okay, let's go negotiate. Because we want a diplomatic and peaceful solution. We have achieved our objectives. We're ready to negotiate this in a peaceful, diplomatic way. We've been prepared to do that for days. They are the ones that played games, as they have done for 40 years, as they have done to multiple presidents. They tried to play games with President Trump, and they see what happens. This is not a game-playing president. When he says he's going to do something, he will do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you saying here you want to de-escalate. When you are talking about diplomacy, you are looking for Iran to pick up that offer that was put on the table you mentioned by Steve Witkoff. Can you just clarify, does that mean the U.S. would still allow for Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it does not enrich on its own soil?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: But that- but that's never been an issue. There's countries all over the world that have a civil nuclear program, no one here is saying that Iran can't--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But that's still the offer on the table?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Sure, that's always been there any kind world has a right to have a civil nuclear program. What they don't have a right to do is to enrich it at 60%, hide it under a mountain and develop long range and short range and mid range missiles and sponsor terrorist proxies all over the world. They don't have a right to do that, and that's what they've been doing. And no one's dealt with it, and it's continued to linger, and they've played games with multiple presidents and multiple countries around the world, and they've gotten away with it for 40 something years. This is very simple. The President wants to resolve this diplomatically and peacefully. He gave them a chance to do that. They delayed. They had all these kind of delay tactics. They wouldn't even meet with us directly. We had to go through third countries. This is very simple. Let's meet directly. Let's work on agreements that we can that are good for Iran, good for the Iranian people in particular, good for the safety and security of the world and the United States. That's always been our preference, that continues to be our preference, but they're the ones that were playing games with this. And these are the consequences. We had to achieve those objectives. We had three objectives yesterday, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. We conducted a brilliant military operation under the command of President Trump, and obviously great credit to Secretary Hegseth and General Kurilla and General Caine and all of our- all the airmen and phenomenal people in the U.S. military. No other military in the world could have done this to achieve those objectives--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it was astounding.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --what happens next is up to the regime. The regime wants peace, we're ready for peace. They want to do something else, they're incredibly vulnerable. They can't even protect their own airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, clearly- clearly, they could not. But what is the U.S. assessment of how much nuclear material at those sites was moved prior to the attack? There has been talk for days about bombing of Fordo.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, we- we don't, no one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran. I mean, the minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it, and they've targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan. And that really is the key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries around the world will take it and down blend it. That's what they should do with that. And what they should do is say we're not going to have any enrichment capability in our country, instead what we're going to have is a civil nuclear program like dozens of countries around the world have where we build reactors that create electricity and we import enriched material. And we've made very general \u2013 I'm not going to get all the details of the offers, but there are other avenues here that would be acceptable to them. If that's what they wanted, if what they want is a civil, peaceful nuclear program, the route has always been there. The problem is that everything they're demanding has nothing to do with a peaceful program. They are all the things you would want if you want to retain the option of one day weaponizing the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Which has been their clear intent. To me, that's indisputable. I followed this issue for 15 years--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Including the intelligence on it for 15 years. Okay? I have followed it. And the intelligence, these are assessments, and sometimes they've been wrong, I've seen them revised multiple times, these guys want a nuclear weapon one day. They do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay, to that point--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --And it isn't going to happen, not while Donald Trump is president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You've said this is not about regime change, but you are describing a regime that you have said for decades, I mean, for upwards of 40 years, has chanted Death to America, has done all the things you just described. Isn't a diplomatic deal with them a lifeline? Aren't you offering to negotiate with the same people you're saying did all these things? So therefore, are you actually looking for regime change?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: But that's not the point. That misses the point. I don't like that they chant those things. But one thing is that they chant those things. Another thing is that they chant those things, and they have terror proxies are all over the world, and they have long range missiles that can reach the United States one day and they have the potential to be one step away from a nuclear weapon--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --One day.--",
      "SEC: RUBIO: --Yeah, well one day could be tomorrow, could be a week from now, could be a month from now. You know, all it takes is the flip of a switch. By the way, they're not going to broadcast that to the world. By the time we figure out that they're doing it, you have all the pieces in place. Okay?--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --So are there still targets you want to hit?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --It's like a loaded, a gun here, and the ammunition. It only takes one second. We have other targets that we could hit, but we achieved our objective. The primary targets we were interested in are the ones that were struck tonight in devastating fashion. The ones that were struck, I guess, yeah tonight over there their time, and devastating fashion. And we've achieved that objective. There are no planned military operations right now against Iran unless, unless they mess around and they attack American or American interests. Then they're going to have a problem. Then they're going to have a problem. And I'm not going to broadcast what those problems are, but suffice it to say, know this, the United States flew halfway around the world, right into the heart of Iran, over their most sensitive locations. These things got rocked, and then we left, and we were out of their airspace, we were over the ocean before they figured out what had happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: And there's plenty of other targets-- We don't want to do that. That's not our preference. We want peace deals with them, and that's up to them to decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said defend American interests. Would the United States military take action to keep, for example, the transit point, the Strait of Hormuz, open? If there are attacks on oil installations, would the United States consider that a direct act by the state, even if it was carried out by a militia?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to take options away from the President. That's not something we're talking about right now in terms of being immediate. But if they do that, the first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government because they take, a lot of their oil comes through there. So they should be the first ones that are saying, if they mine the Straits of Hormuz, the Chinese are going to pay a huge price. And every other country in the world is going to pay a huge price. We will too. It will have some impact on us. It will have a lot more impact on the rest of the world, a lot more impact on the rest of the world. That would be a suicidal move on their part because I think the, the whole world would come against them if they did that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the Chinese and Russians stop trading with Iran?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I have to ask the Chinese and the Russians.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You haven't' asked them?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Probably not. I mean, they're getting, you know, they're, well, the Russians are getting a bunch of these, you know, these drones that they're using are coming from Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --They're coming from Iran. So I saw the foreign minister, instead of meeting with Steve Witkoff, is headed to Moscow to meet with Putin, which was a pre-scheduled meeting, which is fine, you know they can go meet. And you know the- the Russians at the end of the day, I mean, they buy drones from them. But look, this is very simple. They, we want to have an agreement with them, a diplomatic agreement in which they have a civil nuclear program but are not enriching and don't have weapons-grade material or weapons grade capabilities laying around. It's that simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But they're \u2013 understood.--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: That's our interest here. Who they trade with, who they deal with. Those are other topics. Our objective here is very straightforward. They're not going to have a nuclear weapon. They're not even going to get close to a nuclear weapon. They're not even going to be in the neighborhood of a nuclear weapon because these people are dangerous. This is a radical Shia clerics, who run that country--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --And they are the source of all instability in the region, all of it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And you're offering to negotiate with them.--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Without this regime, there is no Hamas. There is no Hezbollah. Well because we don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay, but let me--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --That's the core objective. But no, no, but I'm going through the things they've done, because that's why they can't have a nuclear weapon. Okay? They sponsor Shias--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, I'm just trying to--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --I'm sorry they sponsor the Shia militias, Hamas, Hezbollah, all these other terrorist groups. These people aren't getting, are never going to get anywhere close to a nuclear weapon, not while Donald Trump is president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For the Americans, for the Americans at home who are going are we at war, you know, I'm trying to suss out some of the facts here. So why would, why would Iran agree to any peace deal if the United States is already pulled out of one that they had, as President Trump did in 2018, and now launched two surprise attacks, both Israel and the United States have done so. There is such a massive trust deficit there. How could you possibly come to--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, but the trust deficit started with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0I know.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well the trust deficit, the ones that shouldn't be trusted are the Iranians because they're the ones that sponsor terrorism. Did they forewarn us before they blew up the embassy in Lebanon and killed over 200 American servicemen? Did they forewarn us before they built IEDs and blew the legs and arms off of American servicemen in Iraq? I mean these are the people that are doing this forever. They're the ones that no one should trust. They're the ones that have lied about their nuclear program. They're the ones that have hidden things from the international organisms.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that sounds like, but that all sounds like we're headed towards regime change, where the desire to get these people out of power. Are you--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No, no, no, now. A serious foreign policy is one that's focused on identifying what our national interest is. You don't have to like the regime. There are a lot of regimes around the world that we don't like. Okay, but in this particular case, what we are focused on is not the changing of the regime. Okay, that's up to the Iranian people if they want to do that, but that's not what we're focused on. Our national interest is about one thing, and that is Iran not getting anywhere near the capability to weaponize and have nuclear weapons. They're not going to get anywhere near that capability. The President has made that clear from day one. Our preference for solving that problem, that very specific problem, is through diplomacy. We've said that. We've given it every opportunity. They played games, they tried delay tactics. They're trying delay tactics now on the Europeans because of the snapback provisions.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When did the president--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --And you talked about the JCPOA. That was a crazy deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When did the President make this decision? Because he said he was giving two more weeks of diplomacy on Friday, and on Friday, these jets took off.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, the president retains the opportunity to pull out of this at any moment, including 10 minutes before. But the president ordered options. The President- \u00a0look the decision, in my view, was made when he wrote a letter to the supreme leader and he said over the next 60 days we want to do a deal with you and solve this problem of nuclear weaponization and we want to do it peacefully. If after 60 days, we don't see progress or it isn't solved, we have other alternatives. He made that very clear.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Mr. Secretary--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think what some people struggling with here is that we today have a president who does what he says he's going to do, and that's what happened here--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Mr. Secretary\u2013",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --And hopefully the Iranian regime got that message.",

      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 12:11:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Real estate company Compass claims Zillow is illegally undermining competition by banning property listings if they don't appear on Zillow within 24 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

    "story": [
      "A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a \"heightened threat environment in the United States\" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.",
      "The bulletin, first obtained by CBS News on Sunday morning, June 22, does not note any current specific threats, but warns that \"low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks.\"",
      "While there are no known threats, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said, \"It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict.\"",
      "\"The ongoing Israel-Iran conflict brings the possibility of increased threat to the homeland in the form of possible cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes,\" Noem said in a statement Sunday.",
      "The bulletin notes that U.S. law enforcement \"has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" and warns \"the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets.\"",
      "The bulletin also warns, \"The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against the United States.\"",
      "The bulletin, which has now been officially shared with the public by the Department of Homeland Security, is the type of comprehensive threat assessment designed to communicate information directly to the public about threats and about \"resources for how to stay safe during the heightened threat environment.\"",
      "Multiple sources tell CBS News that intelligence analysts began crafting this document earlier this month. It's gone through many iterations, with plans to publish following any escalation in the conflict overseas or intervention by the United States.",
      "It comes after the U.S. launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday evening, an operation that President Trump said aimed to stop \"the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\" The president warned Iran not to retaliate and to work toward a peace deal in its war with Israel. Speaking at the White House Saturday night, Mr. Trump threatened to target other Iranian sites \"if peace does not come quickly.\"",
      "Iran had previously vowed to retaliate if the U.S. joined Israel's attack, which started June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. More than 650 people have been killed and at least 2,000 have been wounded in Iran since then, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group. At least 24 have also been killed in Israel, and hundreds wounded, in Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, according to estimates from the Israeli military. The conflict has played out as Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza continues.",
      "\"The Iranian Government has declared the United States complicit for Israel's attack, and will almost certainly condemn direct US involvement in the conflict,\" said U.S. officials in Sunday's bulletin.",
      "They additionally cautioned that the Israel-Iran conflict \"could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,\" citing violent incidents in recent months targeting Jewish groups and institutions around the country. Federal law enforcement agencies had already issued an intelligence bulletin in early June warning that those attacks could motivate others.",
      "Law enforcement officials in New York City said Saturday night that they were \"deploying additional resources\" to certain sites as a precaution. The NYPD tweeted: \"We're tracking the situation unfolding in Iran. Out of an abundance of caution, we're deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We'll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC.\"",
      "In addition to the domestic security bulletin, the U.S. State Department issued a worldwide alert for all Americans traveling or planning to travel outside the country, noting that in light of the strikes on Iran, \"there is the potential for demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad. The Department of State advises U.S. citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider a religious rights case brought by a former Louisiana inmate who is seeking to sue Louisiana prison officials for money damages for shaving his dreadlocks in violation of his religious beliefs.",
      "The high court will review a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that said the former inmate, Damon Landor, could not seek monetary damages against the officials in their individual capacities under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.",
      "Landor is a devout Rastafarian who pledged to \"let the locks of the hair of his head grow,\" known as the Nazarite Vow. Landor upheld that pledge for nearly 20 years, until he was nearly finished with a five-month prison sentence in Louisiana.",
      "For the first four months of his incarceration, the two facilities where Landor was housed allowed him to keep his hair long or under a \"rastacap.\" But that changed after Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center for the final three weeks of his sentence. Once there, Landor told an intake guard that he was a practicing Rastafarian and handed over proof of his religious accommodations, as well as a copy of a 2017 decision from the 5th Circuit that found Louisiana's policy of cutting Rastafarians' hair violated RLUIPA, according to court filings.",
      "But two guards ultimately handcuffed Landor to a chair, held him down and had his head shaved, according to papers filed with the Supreme Court.",
      "Landor filed a lawsuit against the prison officials after he was released and brought numerous claims, including under the RLUIPA. But a federal judge agreed to dismiss the case, finding that the law does not allow for damages against individual state officials.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the 5th Circuit affirmed that decision, ruling that while it \"emphatically\" condemned Landor's treatment, a prior decision in the circuit required it to hold that he could not seek money damages from officials in their individual capacities for violations of RLUIPA.",
      "The full 5th Circuit refused to reconsider the case, with 11 judges voting not to rehear it and six voting in favor.",
      "The case follows a Supreme Court decision from December 2020 in which it unanimously held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RLUIPA's sister statute, allows litigants to obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.",
      "Lawyers for Landor argued that Congress enacted the two laws to provide meaningful protection for religious liberty, and denying litigants the opportunity to seek damages for violations of RLUIPA would render that promise empty.",
      "Louisiana officials said in court papers that the allegations raised in Landor's appeal are \"antithetical to religious freedom and fair treatment of state prisoners,\" and condemned them \"in the strongest possible terms.\" But they urged the Supreme Court to turn away his appeal and said the state amended its prison grooming policy to prevent other inmates from being treated as Landor was.",

      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

      "A brutal heat wave is settling in across the eastern United States, and it's forecast to bring several days of record-high temperatures this week. The National Weather Service has called it \"the first significant heat wave this season.\"",
      "The NWS said people from the Midwest to the East Coast should expect \"numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures\" through at least Wednesday.",
      "\"Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,\" the weather service warned.",
      "More than 150\u202fmillion Americans are under the highest-level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rises to 200 million.

      "Heat wave forecast maps",
      "\"Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming  in HOT,\" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings \"with oppressive humidity.\" The\u00a0heat index\u00a0is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity.",
      "Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. Forecasts in Philadelphia called for a heat index of 108 on Monday.",
      "Meteorologists say it's due to\u00a0a heat dome\u00a0\u2014 an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity \u2014 sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality.",
      "These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures.",
      "How long will the heat wave last?",
      "The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of next week.",
      "Parts of the Northeast face a \"High Risk\" of extreme heat through the middle of next week, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures are forecast to be well into the 90s or even triple digits.",
      "\"I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. \"The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon.\"",
      "What constitutes a heat wave?",
      "A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly.",
      "Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down.",
      "\"Your body needs a reprieve,\" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. \"You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit.\"",
      "When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, \"You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality.\"",
      "Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S.",
      "How to stay safe during a heat wave",
      "The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.",
      "If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended. You should also\u00a0stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty.",
      "It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "summary": "The judge acknowledged in her ruling that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him.",
    "story": [
      "A Tennessee judge on Sunday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. But he is not expected to be allowed to go free.",
      "At his June 13 detention hearing, prosecutors said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would take Abrego Garcia into custody if he were released on the criminal charges, and he could be deported before he has a chance to stand trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release. The U.S. government has already filed a motion to appeal the judge's release order.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday that Abrego Garcia \"will never go free on American soil.\"",
      "Holmes acknowledged in her ruling Sunday that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him. But the judge wrote that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and \"a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial.\"",
      "Holmes wrote that the government failed to prove that Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, that he posed a danger to the community or that he would interfere with proceedings if released.",
      "\"Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego Garcia's\u00a0release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges that his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify the deportation mistake after the fact.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Rob McGuire, argued on June 13 that the likely attempt by ICE to try to deport him was one reason to keep him in jail.",
      "But Holmes said then that she had no intention of \"getting in the middle of any ICE hold.\"",
      "\"If I elect to release Mr. Abrego, I will impose conditions of release, and the U.S. Marshal will release him.\" If he is released into ICE custody, that is \"above my pay grade,\" she said.",
      "The judge suggested that the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security could work out between themselves whether the government's priority is to try him on the criminal charges or deport him. No date has been set for the trial.",
      "Will Allensworth, an assistant federal public defender representing Abrego Garcia at the detention hearing, told Holmes that \"it's not necessarily accurate that he would be immediately deported.\"",
      "A 2019 immigration judge's order prevents Abrego Garcia, who had been living in Maryland, from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, Allensworth said in court. That's because he faces a credible threat from gangs there, according to court papers.",
      "The government could deport him to a third country, but immigration officials would first be required to show that third country was willing to keep him and not simply deport him back to El Salvador, Allensworth said.",
      "The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Although officers suspected possible smuggling, he was allowed to go on his way with only a warning.",
      "At the detention hearing, McGuire said cooperating witnesses have accused Abrego Garcia of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims. Although he is not charged with such crimes, McGuire said they showed Abrego Garcia to be a dangerous person who should remain in jail pretrial.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the U.S. government deported Abrego Garcia and the Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate his return amid mounting public pressure.",
      "Chris Newman, an attorney who represents Abrego Garcia's family, previously told CBS News, \"The Trump administration is very invested in making this a referendum on the immigration debate, which, as you know, has become coarsened and polarized.\"",
      "\"And that is one way to look at it. And I think certainly a lot of people view it that way. I don't view it that way. I view this as a core constitutional order case, a core due process case,\" Newman said. \"And it just so happens that a Salvadoran immigrant is defending bedrock constitutional protections for all of us.\"",
      "Most people in ICE custody who are facing criminal charges are not kept in the U.S. for trial but deported, Ohio State University law professor C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "The U.S. will likely try to deport Abrego Garcia quickly without going before an immigration judge, the professor said. The government would not need a conviction to deport him because Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"The legal standard is laxer,\" Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. \"The government's argument is on stronger legal footing.\"",
      "However an immigration judge rules, the decision can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. And the board's ruling can then be contested in a federal appeals court.",

      "\"Deflated, but proud of everything we've accomplished,\" Pacers guard TJ McConnell said.",

      "\"There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Remember, there are many targets left.\"",

      "The president said the objective of the strikes was to end \"the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror.\" Prior to the start of military action, Mr. Trump sought a deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program.",

      "All three sites that were targeted Saturday evening are part of Iran's nuclear program. Fordo\u00a0is 300 feet underground and protected by a Russian-produced anti-missile system. It's a high-grade uranium enrichment plant that can hold about 3,000 centrifuges. Fordo has long been believed by nuclear weapons experts to be central to any effort by Iran to produce weapons-grade uranium because of its size, security and technical capacity.",
      "Natanz, which is about 135 miles southeast of Tehran, in Isfahan province, is the country's main enrichment site. It operates multiple cascades of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium. On June 13, Israel struck Natanz, and IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the United Nations Security Council Iran had confirmed the attack on Natanz and said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% was \"destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged.",
      "The Isfahan facility, about 80 miles south of Natanz, hosts thousands of nuclear scientists and is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a screenshot of a post on X from \"Open Source Intel\" that says: \"Fordow is gone.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out the strikes nine days after Israel launched its offensive on Iranian military and nuclear targets \u2014 an operation Mr. Trump said the U.S. was not involved with.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, according to the IAEA \u2014 though Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is only intended for peaceful purposes. Before Israel's initial strikes the IAEA noted in a classified report obtained by CBS News that Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60%, which remains a matter of serious concern. Uranium for civilian use is enriched to a much lower rate, between 3% and 5%.",
      "On Friday, the president said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \"wrong\" when she testified in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, and the White House said this week that Iran has everything it needs to build a nuclear weapon and a green light from Iran's supreme leader would enable Iran to ready a nuclear weapon within weeks. Mr. Trump said Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon. Gabbard was among the White House officials in the Situation Room monitoring the U.S. strikes Saturday.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

      "Why? Rooms' paint colors can boost a home's sale price by almost $2,600, according to a new report from real estate marketplace Zillow.

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

    "summary": "If Iran were to retaliate against the U.S. after the Trump administration's surprise bombings of three nuclear sites, here's what an expert says Tehran could target.",
    "story": [
      "Iran on Monday vowed retaliation against the United States for the Trump administration's surprising bombings of the Islamic republic's top three nuclear sites over the weekend. Iran's Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Aragchi, now in Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Iran \"has to respond.\"",
      "If Tehran followed through on its rhetoric, potential moves could include attacking U.S. military assets across the Middle East, closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is a chokepoint for 20% of the world's oil, and carrying out so-called asymmetric warfare that includes terror and cyber attacks around the world.",
      "U.S. military assets in the Middle East",
      "The U.S. operates eight permanent military bases in as many countries across the Middle East \u2014\u00a0Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt and Iraq \u2014 with nearly a dozen more military facilities across the region, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Chief among these permanent bases is in Qatar at the Al Udeid Air Base with about 10,000 service personnel. Just west, Bahrain is home to a U.S. naval base called Naval Support Activity Bahrain with an estimated 9,000 troops. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 U.S. servicemembers are stationed across the region.",
      "\"There's a range of options in Iran's own target deck,\" Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik at the UK's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) told CBS News. \"Unlike Iran's targeting of Israel, which is far more difficult geographically due to the distance, Iran's stockpile or arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles makes American military installations in the Gulf more vulnerable. They're softer targets in that sense.\"",
      "Iraq, which shares a nearly-1,000 mile porous border with Iran to the east, \"tends to be seen as the next potential frontline in where the conflict can escalate,\" she said, because of \"a number of Iran-linked Shia paramilitary groups\" that may act independently from the Iranian government. Such groups have in the past attacked the U.S. Al Asad Air Base in Iraq and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.",
      "U.S. naval assets, which include aircraft carriers and their accompanying destroyers, along with various amphibious and other support ships, are also potential targets. The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group is currently deployed in the Arabian Sea, while President Trump redirected the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the Middle East from the South China Sea. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is also en route. Several U.S. guided-missile destroyers are patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean.",
      "These dozens of ships provide possible targets for various forms of Iranian attacks, including \"heavily armed speedboats, short-range ballistic missiles, surface to air missiles,\" said Ozcelik, \"that could target American vessels or American allied vessels, similar to what the Houthis have been exercising in the Red Sea. And so Iran would replicate those techniques, but potentially on a larger and more lethal scale.\"",
      "Strait of Hormuz and 20% of the world's oil",
      "U.S. military assets aside, Iran could cause global economic and energy pain by attempting to choke off passage through the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly 20% to 25% of the world's oil passes, along with a similar percentage of liquified natural gas. The crucial waterway connects oil-rich Persian Gulf nations to the Gulf of Oman then the world. At its narrowest point, it stretches just 21 miles across, with Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south.",
      "Iran's navy could lay thousands of mines to damage ships trying to pass through. RUSI's Ozcelik said this would symbolize a desperate \"act of last resort,\" which would mean Iran is \"reeling out of control and spiraling.\"",
      "\"We can consider this as one of those suicide mission type tactics,\" she said. \"If Iran were to go that far, the retaliatory implications would be very costly and also would counter Iran's own interests with respect to its oil export capabilities as well as its relationships with the Gulf ... and its oil trade relationship with China.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday called on Beijing to help prevent Iran from closing the strait. On Sunday, Iran's state-run Press TV reported that Iran's parliament, the Majlis, approved a plan to close the Strait of Hormuz but added the final decision would be with the Supreme National Security Council.",
      "Oil analysts predict prices could jump 50-60% if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. One barrel of oil is currently trading in the $70 per barrel range. That could jump to $120. Whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, releases more oil to compensate would determine the length of any possible price shock.",
      "\"Even if it's for a short term and the Strait of Hormuz is subsequently reopened or Iran doesn't maintain that level of threat for a prolonged amount of time,\" said Ozcelik. \"Iran still would suffer the consequences of that potentially, both in terms of its status, its reliability with the Gulf, as well as the oil infrastructure in the region, which has implications for Iran's own sanction-busting oil trade.\"",
      "Terrorist and cyber attacks",
      "Ozcelik said the real long-term protracted threat lies in \"the asymmetric warfare space and potentially state-sponsored terrorism.\"",
      "On Sunday, the U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System warned of a \"heightened threat environment\" in the country. The bulletin did not cite any specific threats but said \"low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks.\"",
      "The warning came after a pro-Iran hacktivist group, known as \"313 Team,\" claimed credit for a short-lived outage of President Trump's Truth Social messaging platform on Saturday.

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 Israel said it carried out more strikes on Iran on Monday, targeting missile, satellite and radar sites two days after the President Trump ordered American warplanes to join Israel in attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities, fueling concern around the world of an escalating conflict in the heart of the Middle East with the potential to draw in major world powers.",
      "Those concerns may continue to mount, as both Mr. Trump and Israeli officials hint at hopes that the military operations could result in the fall of Iran's theocratic rulers, and as Iran's top diplomat visits Russia looking for support from a key ally. Israel is also expanding its list of targets in Iran to hit sites linked directly to the ruling theocracy's grip on power domestically.",
      "The office of Israel's defense minister said Monday that the military was \"attacking with unprecedented force regime targets and government repression entities in the heart of Iran.\" It was the first time Israel has acknowledged striking targets linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, rather than its military or nuclear assets.",
      "The defense minister's office said the new targets included the notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held, a clock in Tehran's Palestine Square that symbolically displays a countdown to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, which among other things acts as a morality police force for the Islamic rulers.",
      "\"For every shot fired at the Israeli home front, the Iranian dictator will be punished and the attacks will continue with full force,\" the defense minister's office said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Monday that Israeli warplanes had also struck six airports in Iran, \"as part of the effort to expand air superiority over Iranian skies,\" targeting runways, various aircraft and underground hangers.",
      "Iran also launched a new wave of missiles at Israel on Monday, sending people to bomb shelters across the country. Dozens of missiles were reportedly launched at Israel, with impacts in at least two sites in the northern port city of Haifa and on a road in the southern city of Ashdod.",
      "Israel Electric Corporation said that, following a strike near one of its strategic facilities in southern Israel, there was disruption in the supply of electricity to a number of communities in the area.",
      "The attacks came after U.S. B2 bombers attacked three of Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend \u2013 the first direct U.S. military action against Iran after a week of Israeli attacks.",
      "Iranian nuclear sites \"totally obliterated\" by U.S. strikes?",
      "President Trump said in a televised address on Sunday that Iran's highly fortified Fordo nuclear enrichment site, along with the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities, had been \"completely and totally obliterated\" by the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, said during a news conference, noting that a full assessment of the damage would take time.",
      "But while Mr. Trump said in a social media post that the \"spectacular military success\" in Iran had taken \"the 'bomb' right out of their hands,\" The New York Times reported that the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believed Iran could have moved at least some of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another location before the U.S. attack, as Iranian officials have claimed.",
      "In remarks to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi did not mention that prospect specifically, but he said \"no one \u2014 including the IAEA \u2014 is in a position to assess the underground damage\" at\u00a0Iran's most sensitive site at Fordo, where the regime is believed to have carried out advanced enrichment work in secret.",
      "\"We must return to the negotiating table and allow the IAEA inspectors, the guardians of the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], to go back to Iran's nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%,\" Grossi said, referring to the bulk of Iran's highly-enriched uranium, previously known to have been stored at the Isfahan facility. Uranium enriched to that level is only a short technical step away from the 90% purity required to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi warned the delegations at the U.N.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" it would take days to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but he thought it was unlikely.",
      "\"No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now. They can't move anything right now inside Iran. The minute a truck starts driving anywhere the Israelis have seen it, and targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that \u2014 that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there at Isfahan. And that really is key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries in the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that,\" Rubio said, adding another call for Iran to agree to abandon its enrichment work to end the crisis.",
      "Rubio said if Iran were to \"call right now, and say 'we wanna meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.\"",
      "Trump hints at prospect of regime change in Iran",
      "Rubio also reiterated on Sunday President Trump's previous statements that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were carried out with the sole purpose of removing the threat of the regime obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move,\" Rubio said.",
      "Mr. Trump had, right after the U.S. strikes, said they would be the extent of America's involvement in the conflict unless Iran launched retaliatory attacks against U.S. assets in the region. But late on Sunday, in a social media post, Mr. Trump stoked concern about a possible further escalation of the conflict.",
      "\"If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked about the president's remarks on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking: If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks \u2014 we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know \u2014 but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as far as our military posture, it has not been changed.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his top aids have also suggested in recent days that the military action taken by Israel could make room for an uprising in the Islamic Republic to topple Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, and Netanyahu has called directly on Iranians to take to the streets.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/strait-of-hormuz-iran-oil-trade-route-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 09:51:29 -0400",
    "summary": "As U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities drive fears of retaliation, it remains to be seen whether Iran will try to block oil trade via the Strait of Hormuz.",
    "story": [
      "The United States launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday morning local time, an action President Trump said aimed to neutralize a threat \"posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\" It was widely seen as a turning point in America's involvement in the ongoing Middle East conflicts as the first direct intervention by U.S. forces in the war between Israel and Iran.",
      "The strikes have ignited concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and what form such responses could take. Among them are fears Iran could block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage that the country partly controls.",
      "What is the Strait of Hormuz, and why is it important?",
      "Located between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea and at its narrowest point, it is just 21 miles wide. The water, a crucial piece of global trade infrastructure, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Iran controls the northern side of the strait, which runs along its border, and Oman and the United Arab Emirates control the southern side.",
      "Because of that, the strait has become one of the most vital oil \"chokepoints\" in the world, U.S. energy officials say. An analysis released last week by the EIA defined chokepoints as \"narrow channels along widely used global sea routes that are critical to global energy security,\" which can raise shipping costs and cause supply delays if passage through them is disrupted.",
      "Iran has long used the threat of closing the strait as a way to ward off Western pressure.",
      "Which products pass through the Strait?",
      "In 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, more than a quarter of global maritime oil trade flowed through the Strait of Hormuz, equaling about one-fifth of oil and petroleum consumption worldwide, according to the EIA.",
      "The agency estimated roughly 20 million barrels of oil have transited the strait daily since at least 2020, with tanker tracking data indicating close to 40% of the barrels last year were exported from Saudi Arabia \u2014 the most of any country. Along with crude oil and petroleum products, the strait also allowed for about one-fifth of the world's liquefied natural gas trade in 2024, which primarily came from Qatar, the EIA said.",
      "Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have oil pipelines that, to an extent, could serve as alternative trade routes should the Strait of Hormuz become compromised, but their relative capacities would be limited. The EIA noted that disruptions to oil flow through the strait would severely impact a few markets, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea, which imported a majority of the oil and gas that transited it in 2024. In the U.S., the agency reported that oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz only accounted for 7% of the country's total oil imports and 2% of its liquid petroleum consumption over the same period.",
      "However, officials warn that any interference with oil flows through the strait could broadly upset international energy markets and economies, by stifling supply and possibly driving up oil and gas prices.",
      "\"A suicidal move\"",
      "Speaking about what Iran might do next, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that an Iranian effort to block the strait \"would be a suicidal move,\" likely driving backlash from a sizable group of powerful countries that would be impacted by that kind of decision.",
      "\"If they do that, the first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government, because a lot of their oil comes through there,\" Rubio said, when asked about the possibility of Iran mining or otherwise preventing movement through the strait. \"Mining\" entails placing naval mines \u2014 which are explosives \u2014 in the water to damage vessels trying to pass.",
      "If that were to happen, Rubio said China would \"pay a huge price,\" as would \"every other country in the world,\" including the U.S.",
      "\"It will have some impact on us. It will have a lot more impact on the rest of the world,\" he said, hypothetically, of the consequences. \"It would be a suicidal move on their part because, I think, the world would come against them if they did that.\"",
      "The U.S., with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senior Pentagon officials revealed new details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying it was the \"largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history\" and inflicted \"extremely severe damage and destruction\" to the targets.",
      "\"This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman, said in a briefing at the Pentagon on Sunday morning detailing the strikes against the Iranian nuclear sites at\u00a0Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "Caine said the mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, included seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew east from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to Iran. Another group of B-2s flew west over the Pacific to act as decoys \u2014 news reports emerged over the course of the day Saturday that a group of the bombers were headed to the U.S. base in Guam.",
      "Meanwhile, the 18-hour flight east by the bombers that would drop payloads on Iran required multiple in-flight refuelings as the planes crossed the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The bombers met up with U.S. fighter jets and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East, executing a \"complex, tightly timed maneuver,\" Caine said.",
      "Map shows Iran targets, Operation Midnight Hammer flight path",
      "Caine spoke in front of a map showing the flight path of the aircraft, and the timeline of key events in the operation:",
      "At about 5 p.m. ET Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a U.S. submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets at the site in Isfahan. As the bombers approached their targets, the U.S. deployed \"several deception tactics, including decoys,\" and fighter jets cleared the airspace ahead of them, checking for enemy aircraft and surface-to-air missiles.",
      "\"We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,\" Caine said.",
      "At about 6:40 p.m. ET, or 2:10 a.m. in Iran, the lead B-2 dropped two \"bunker-buster\" bombs known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, on the site at Fordo. Over the next 25 minutes, Caine said, a total of 14 MOPs would be dropped on targets at Fordo and Natanz. The Tomahawk missiles landed at Isfahan after bombs were dropped on the two other sites. Caine said no shots were fired at the planes as they left Iranian airspace.",
      "\"Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission, we retained the element of surprise,\" Caine said.",
      "\"More than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission,\" Caine said, including the B-2 bombers, fighter jets, refueling planes and surveillance aircraft. More than 75 precision-guided weapons were used in the attack, Caine noted.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said, noting that a full assessment will take time.",
      "The chairman warned Iran against taking any retaliatory action for the strikes.",
      "\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice,\" Caine said. \"We will defend ourselves.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack \"an incredible and overwhelming success.\"",
      "\"The order we received from our commander in chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear,\" Hegseth said at the briefing alongside Caine. \"We devastated the Iranian nuclear program, but it's worth noting that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.\"",
      "He added: \"The operation President Trump planned was bold, and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back. When this president speaks, the world should listen.\"",
      "\"Our B-2s went in and out \u2026 and back without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001, and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced Saturday evening that the U.S. had launched strikes against Iran. He said in a national address later Saturday night that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "Flanked by Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House, the president described the strikes as a \"spectacular military success\" and warned of \"far greater\" attacks if Iran does not \"make peace.\"",
      "\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill, most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,\" he said. \"There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made his final decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday aboard M1 during a call with Hegseth. The defense secretary advised Mr. Trump it was time to strike or abort the mission, after which the president gave the green light, according to a White House official.",

      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" Araghchi said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "On Thursday, the president said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"within the next two weeks.\" One source told CBS News at the time that Mr. Trump \"believes there's not much choice. Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said earlier Saturday that the U.S. had begun evacuating Americans and green card holders out of Israel aboard assisted departure flights. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their accompanying immediate family members and lawful permanent residents, the State Department said prior to Mr. Trump's announcement of the strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House released photos of the Situation Room during the strikes. In the room with the president were Vance, Hegseth, Rubio, chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, White House general counsel David Warrington and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Gabbard's presence in the room was significant, as on Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that she was \"wrong\" when she testified to Congress in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.",

      "New satellite photos show the aftermath of the U.S. military strike\u00a0that dropped multiple 30,000-pound \"bunker-buster\" bombs on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and hit two other key locations in Iran's nuclear program.",
      "The stealth U.S. mission, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" struck three nuclear facilities in Iran \u2014 Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan \u2014 in the early hours of Sunday local time.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing Sunday that seven B-2 Spirit bombers each carried two of the bombs known as GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs. Over 25 minutes, a total of 14 MOPs were dropped on two target areas at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles from a U.S. submarine targeted the Isfahan site, he said.",
      "He said it was the first time those massive bombs have ever been used in an operation.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "Satellite photos show impact of strikes on Fordo",
      "Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, taken Sunday after the strikes, show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried about 300 feet down. They can be compared to images of the same location taken before the strikes.",
      "A layer of ash caused by the airstrikes can be seen across a large swath of the area.",
      "The images by Maxar show several large diameter holes or craters on the top of the ridge over the underground complex.",
      "Additionally, several of the tunnel entrances that lead to the underground facility appear blocked by dirt following the strikes.",
      "Asked at the briefing whether any of Iran's nuclear capability remains, Caine said, \"I think (battle damage assessment) is still pending, and it would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there.\"",
      "Iran has yet to offer a damage assessment of the site. The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post that it had seen \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "In a statement on Sunday to the U.N. Security Council, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said his team was unable to assess the underground damage at Fordo. Following the attacks, he said there's a \"window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy.\"",
      "\"If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi said.",
      "Craters, destroyed buildings in Isfahan and Natanz",
      "At Isfahan, which was targeted by about a dozen Tomahawk missiles, satellite images from Sunday show extensive building damage across the facility, compared to images taken June 16. The Israeli military had also heavily bombed Isfahan in recent days",
      "Grossi told the UN Security Council that affected buildings include some related to the uranium conversion process. Entrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit, the IAEA director general said.",
      "At the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, a satellite image captured Sunday by Maxar shows an approximately 5.5-meter diameter hole or crater in the dirt directly over part of the underground military complex.",
      "Natanz had been previously damaged by the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13.",
      "Grossi confirmed Sunday that the fuel enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit again, with the U.S. confirming that it used ground-penetrating munitions. He said Iran has informed the nuclear watchdog there has been no increase in off-site radiation levels following the attacks. However, bombing nuclear facilities \"could result in radioactive releases with grave consequence,\" Grossi warned, urging \"maximum restraint.\"",
      "U.S. military used decoys and deception in attack",
      "President Trump announced Saturday evening that the U.S. had launched strikes against Iran. He said in a\u00a0national address later Saturday night\u00a0that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday that the U.S. used decoy B-2 bombers, which flew west over the Pacific from their base in Missouri earlier Saturday, to throw off the Iranians from the true plans. The bombers actually involved in the strike took off on an eastward path, refueling several times on their way to the Middle East.",
      "Hegseth added that the U.S. used other methods of deception to protect the B-2 bombers that dropped the 14 \"bunker-buster\" bombs. He said the tactics helped the U.S. drop the bombs without tipping off Iran's fighter jets or its air missile systems.",
      "\"Our B-2s went in and out \u2026 and back without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way, it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001, and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\"",

      "Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former head of U.S. Central Command and a CBS News contributor, said the U.S. would be able to clear the strait if Iran lined it with underwater mines.",
      "\"The Iranians do have the capability to mine the Strait of Hormuz. We have very good plans to clear that if we had to do it. We work on those plans all the time,\" McKenzie told Brennan later in the show. \"It would be a blow to world commerce, for a period of time, but at the end, the strait would be cleared, and I'm pretty confident the Iranian navy would all be sunk at the end of that operation.\"",
      "The U.S. operation on Saturday, which the Trump administration named \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, causing what the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said was \"extremely severe damage and destruction.\" The Pentagon acknowledged that capturing a complete assessment of the operation's effectiveness will take time.",
      "Brennan pressed Rubio on what specific intelligence pushed the president to make the decision to strike Iran. In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified before Congress that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, testimony Mr. Trump declared \"wrong.\" Rubio said Iran, ahead of the strikes, had \"everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" and pointed to assessments by the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.",
      "\"Here's what the whole world knows. Forget about intelligence,\" Rubio told Brennan. \"What the IAEA knows, they are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a civil nuclear program. So why would you enrich uranium at 60% if you don't intend to use it to one day take it to 90 and build a weapon? Why are you developing ICBMs?\"",
      "Brennan asked Rubio whether the U.S. will defend other nations in the Middle East if Iran launches attacks on their soil in response. Rubio said that's why U.S. bases \u2014 and about 40,000 U.S. troops \u2014 are positioned across the Middle East.",
      "\"Well, that's exactly why they're there,\" he said, adding, \"All those bases are there because they're afraid that Iran will attack them.\"",
      "Rubio insisted that the U.S. will defend Americans, including U.S. soldiers on military bases, from Iran and its proxies.",
      "\"They'll attack us, is what they're threatening to do,\" he said. \"So we'll defend our people, obviously. We'll defend our people. Well, they'll attack our bases. And those are our bases, and we're going to defend our personnel, and we're prepared to do that.\"",
      "Rubio said he didn't want to forecast what the U.S. might do if Iran retaliates.",
      "\"There are no planned military operations right now against Iran unless they mess around and they attack Americans or American interests, then they're going to have a problem,\" he said. \"Then they're going to have a problem, and I'm not going to broadcast what those problems are.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Lawmakers across the political aisle offered a mixed response Saturday following President Trump's announcement that the\u00a0United States launched strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Immediately following Mr. Trump's announcement, Congressional Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz, backed Mr. Trump's actions, while a number of leading Democrats condemned his decision to launch the attack without consulting Congress.",
      "In a televised address Saturday night, the president described the strikes as a \"spectacular military success\" and said \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He warned of \"far greater\" attacks if Iran does not \"make peace.\"",
      "\"There is not another military in the World that could have done this,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Here's what lawmakers are saying:",
      "Many Republican lawmakers back U.S. strikes in Iran, but not all",
      "\"Good. This was the right call. The regime deserves it. Well done, President @realDonaldTrump,\" Sen. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on X.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a social media post that \"the military operations in Iran should serve as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that President Trump means what he says.\"",
      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" Johnson\u00a0said in the post. \"President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated. That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Cruz, who has backed of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets, said in a statement: \"As long as Iran was able to access and conduct activities at Fordow, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal. Tonight's actions have gone far in foreclosing that possibility, and countering the apocalyptic threat posed by an Iranian nuclear arsenal.\"",
      "Rep. Rick Crawford, Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Trump in a statement and said, \"I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days.\"",
      "The strikes announced by Mr. Trump Saturday evening further escalated the conflict between\u00a0Iran and Israel\u00a0that started June 13. Mr. Trump, on Wednesday,\u00a0was still mulling over\u00a0whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran.",
      "Before the announcement of the strikes, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was among the few Republicans who opposed the U.S. action, arguing on social media, \"This is not our fight.\"",
      "\"Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,\" she said in a post on X. \"There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.\"",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, reshared Mr. Trump's post on the strikes with a terse comment: \"not constitutional.\" Massie\u00a0introduced a resolution on Tuesday to prohibit U.S. involvement in the conflict. A few days earlier, he pointed out that the power to authorize use of military force rests with Congress, and\u00a0said\u00a0of the Israel-Iran conflict on X, \"This is not our war.  But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Massie said his resolution, introduced with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, seeks \"to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority, to declare war and to- and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war.\"",
      "Some Democrats say U.S. strikes in Iran are unconstitutional",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats agreed with Massie that the president should have consulted Congress, and on Saturday demanded that lawmakers be \"fully and immediately\" briefed on the attacks in a classified setting.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called for Congress to enforce the War Powers Act.",
      "\"President Trump must provide the American people and Congress clear answers on the actions taken tonight and their implications for the safety of Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"No president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy. Confronting Iran's ruthless campaign of terror, nuclear ambitions, and regional aggression demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity. The danger of wider, longer, and more devastating war has now dramatically increased.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while there is \"no question that Iran poses a serious threat to regional stability,\" the president's actions threaten to drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict \"without consulting Congress\" and \"without a clear strategy.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored Massie's resolution seeking to limit Mr. Trump's war powers, said in a statement early Sunday that Congress \"needs to come back to DC immediately to vote\" on the resolution \"to ensure there is no further conflict and escalation.\"",
      "\"Trump's strikes are unconstitutional and put Americans, especially our troops, at risk,\" Khanna said.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation,\" Khanna said \"the procedure should have been that Congress was briefed before we decided to enter war, and that we actually had a vote on it.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts\u00a0called on Congress\u00a0to return to Washington to vote on Massie and Khanna's legislation \"to stop this madness.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has introduced a similar resolution in the Senate, and told \"Face the Nation\" that he was \"so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.\"",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called Mr. Trump's decision to bomb Iran without congressional authorization \"is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.\"",
      "\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been trying to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. The extent of the president's authority to enter foreign conflicts without the approval of the legislative branch has been questioned in recent years. The last time Congress authorized the use of military force was in 2002, against Iraq. A year earlier, days after the 9/11 terror attacks, Congress passed a bill approving the use of military force against nations, organizations or individuals the president determines \"planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan urged Democratic colleagues in a post, \"Don't make another mistake in dragging our country into another war,\" and added, \"You can stop the President and the war mongers in Congress by signing on to our War Powers Resolution.\"",
      "In contrast to other Congressional Democrats, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said he fully supports the U.S. strikes on Iran.",
      "\"As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS,\" Fetterman said in a social media post. \"Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I'm grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.\"",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's on a tour this weekend in red Southern states, announced the news of the U.S. attacks on Iran to his supporters and was met the chants of \"no more war\" from the crowd.",
      "\"It is so grossly unconstitutional,\" Sanders said. \"All of you know that the only entity that can take this country to war is the U.S. Congress. The president does not have the right.\"",

      "Some may assume that losing teeth is just part of growing older.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 and that number rises to one in five at age 75 and older.",
      "But according to experts, this isn\u2019t inevitable. Dental professionals shared the following tips to prevent tooth loss and boost overall health.",
      "1. Protect gum health",
      "About two in three adults over age 65 are dealing with some form of gum disease, according to a recently published AARP report.",
      "6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "Clinical experts cited in the report, including Dr. Uchenna Akosa, assistant professor and director at Rutgers Health University Dental Associates in New Jersey, warn that bleeding gums can signal a much deeper problem.",
      "\"Even if you have not lost any teeth, gum disease impairs your ability to chew hard food,\" Akosa told AARP. \"That will affect your nutrition and can put you at risk of malnutrition in the future.\"",
      "If your gums bleed when brushing, or if you notice sensitivity or recession, those are signs to schedule a dental visit.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Left untreated, gum disease can also destroy the bones that hold teeth in place and may interfere with nutrition and chewing.",
      "Gum disease is also a source of chronic inflammation in the body, which can contribute to dementia risk, studies have shown. A meta-analysis of about 34,000 people found that older adults who had lost all of their teeth had a 1.4 times greater risk of developing dementia, as cited by AARP.",
      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth.",
      "Experts recommend focusing on early prevention. If your gums bleed when brushing, or if you notice sensitivity or recession, those are signs to schedule a dental visit.",
      "Regular professional cleanings and checkups can catch gum problems before they lead to tooth loss or other health effects.",
      "People who had lost all of their teeth had a 1.4 times greater risk of developing dementia, according to the AARP. (iStock)",

      "Dr. David Frey, a cosmetic dentist at Your Perfect Smile in Beverly Hills, California, said that he often recommends water flossers \u2013 particularly the Sonic-Fusion by Waterpik \u2013 to older patients.",
      "\"It\u2019s especially valuable for patients with arthritis, limited mobility or trouble using traditional floss,\" Frey told Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Take steps to prevent dry mouth",
      "Saliva plays an essential role in neutralizing acids and protecting tooth enamel, but dry mouth affects nearly six in 10 older adults, according to AARP.",
      "Many common medications \u2014 including antihistamines, antidepressants and blood pressure drugs \u2014 can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to tooth decay, infection and gum disease, WebMD states.",
      "IS OZEMPIC RUINING YOUR TEETH? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IMPACT ON DENTAL HEALTH",
      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",
      "The recommended frequency of dental visits is not one-size-fits-all, according to AARP. Some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits. (iStock)",
      "Oral health issues in older adults often go unnoticed, especially those related to bite alignment, according to Frey.",
      "\"Bite-related issues are often an overlooked source of headaches and neck pain,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The public simply hasn\u2019t been informed that tension, misalignment and jaw dysfunction can manifest in ways that seem unrelated at first glance.\"",

      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare typically doesn\u2019t cover cleanings, fillings or other routine procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",
      "This financial gap often leads people to skip dental care altogether, which can cause more serious (and expensive) problems in the future.",
      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",
      "And while sugary cough drops or hard candies may seem harmless, they can be damaging to tooth enamel over time, experts warn.",
      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",

      "Bob Schwartz is pictured planking while two of the club's fitness trainers sit on his back. (Bob Schwartz)",
      "\"Prior to that, one minute was probably my max, although by this time, my core was in pretty decent shape,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"The hardest part is just making the commitment to exercise, and staying with it long enough for it to become a habit.\"",
      "The passion for planking has become a family affair, as Schwartz\u2019s youngest grandson, who is 7 years old, has started joining him in plank challenges.",
      "Schwartz embraces planking as a convenient way to work virtually every major muscle in the body. \"A plank can be done at home, without equipment,\u00a0and in a short period of time,\" he noted.",

      "\"Since I\u2019ve been doing core exercises, I have never had a back issue,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "Schwartz said he also adheres to a \"healthy-ish\" diet, aiming for a minimum of one serving of fruit, two servings of vegetables, fish for at least one meal, and usually chicken (or occasionally pork or beef) for dinner.",

      "\"The hardest part is just making the commitment to exercise, and staying with it long enough for it to become a habit and part of your lifestyle,\" he said.",

      "Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that America \"is not at war with Iran,\" but rather is at war with the Iranian nuclear program, which was \"substantially\" set back by U.S. strikes.",
      "In an appearance on ABC\u2019s \"This Week,\" Vance praised President Donald Trump\u2019s \"decisive action to destroy the program\" and expressed an \"incredible amount of gratitude\" to the U.S. troops, who, he says, flew thousands of miles on a 30-hour non-stop flight, \"never touched down on the ground\" and dropped a 30,000-pound bomb \"on a target about the size of a washing machine.\"",
      "\"No military in the world has the training, the skills, and the equipment to do what these guys did last night,\" Vance said. \"I know the president and I are both very proud of them, and I think what they did was accomplish a very core American national objective. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapons program. The president's been very clear about this, and thanks to the bravery and competence and skill of our great pilots and everybody who supported this mission, we took a major step forward for that national objective last night.\"",
      "Vance was hesitant to disclose too much sensitive information about the mission, which reportedly involved 125 aircraft.",

      "ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl asked the vice president, \"Can you say definitively that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been destroyed?\"",
      "\"I don't want to get into sensitive intelligence here, but we know that we set the Iranian nuclear program back substantially last night. Whether it's years or beyond that, we know it's going to be a very long time before Iran can even build a nuclear weapon if they want to,\" Vance said.",
      "Pressed on the extent of the damage, the vice president again declined to disclose sensitive intelligence but added, \"I feel extremely confident, and I can say to the American people with great confidence that they are much further away from a nuclear program today than they were 24 hours ago.\"",
      "\"That was the objective of the mission \u2013 \u00a0to destroy that Fordow nuclear site \u2013 \u00a0and, of course, do some damage to the other sites as well,\" he said. \"But we feel very confident that the Fordow nuclear site was substantially set back and that was our goal.\"",

Our national interest is for Iran to not get a nuclear weapon. Our strikes last night facilitated that national objective. If the Iranians want to enlarge this by attacking American troops, I think that would be a catastrophic mistake.\"",

And so they really have to choose a pathway,\" Vance told ABC. \"Are they going to go down the path of continued war, of funding terrorism, of seeking a nuclear weapons? Or are they going work with us to give up nuclear weapons permanently? If they're willing to choose the smart path, they're certainly going to find a willing partner in the United States to dismantle that nuclear weapons program.\"",

If your web browser automatically populates your username and password for you, make sure this information is free of typos.",

Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft, credential stuffing, phishing and spam.",

      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): Enabling\u00a02FA is one of the most effective ways to stop unauthorized access, even if someone has your password. When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",

      "7. Use a VPN to protect your online activity: Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a VPN to protect your information when browsing on unsecured networks. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "Cyberattacks on financial service providers are no longer isolated events. In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "The data stolen in the attack includes what appears to be corporate documents and sensitive customer case files. Tax documents are especially valuable to cybercriminals. They often contain Social Security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers and other identifiers that can be used to commit financial fraud or impersonation.",
      "Sources familiar with the incident told\u00a0BleepingComputer this was a double-extortion attack. That means Chaos not only stole the data but also encrypted Optima\u2019s systems, presumably demanding a ransom in exchange for access and non-disclosure.

      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",
      "HOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world\u2019s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand. Whether AI ends up helping or hurting the climate may depend on how quickly clean energy breakthroughs catch up and how honestly we measure progress.",

      "Crocodilus malware: What Android users must know now",
      "The\u00a0Crocodilus malware was first documented by ThreatFabric cybersecurity researchers in late March 2025. They highlighted its extensive data theft and remote control capabilities.",
      "Crocodilus uses Facebook to infect devices. It appears in ads that look normal, but once clicked, the malware installs itself on your device. In some cases, it mimicked banking and e-commerce apps in Poland, promising users free points in exchange for downloading an app. The link led to a fake site that delivered the malware. Although the ad was only live for a few hours, it still reached thousands of users, most of whom were over 35, a group more likely to have money in the bank.",
      "Smaller but growing campaigns have also been reported in the United States, where Crocodilus disguised itself as crypto wallet tools, mining apps and financial services. These fake apps are often distributed through social media ads or phishing links, targeting Android users who are less likely to question a \"legit-looking\" financial app. While not yet widespread, the presence of Crocodilus in the U.S. underscores its global reach and rapidly evolving tactics.",
      "ANDROID SECURITY UPGRADES OUTSMART SCAMS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY",
      "The Trojan has also been spotted in Spain, where it disguised itself as a browser update, targeting nearly every major Spanish bank. In Turkey, it posed as an online casino app. And the threat doesn't stop there.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with Crocodilus is its ability to add fake contacts to your phone, inserting entries like \"Bank Support\" into your contact list. So, if an attacker calls pretending to be from your bank, your phone may not flag it because it appears to be a trusted number, making social engineering scams much more convincing.",
      "The latest version also includes a more advanced seed phrase collector, especially dangerous for cryptocurrency users.

      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

This means your full name, home address, email, and phone number are available to anyone, including scammers and stalkers. You can manually opt out of each site, but that takes time and patience. Instead, consider an automated privacy service that scans data broker sites and sends removal requests on your behalf. The less data floating around, the less likely it is to be misused.",

      "If your name, email, or phone number shows up on a form before you even touch the keyboard, that website may have purchased your information. Some sites share consumer data with partners, and this pre-fill behavior can indicate that your data is being sold and shared.",

It's an effective way to remove your name from public listings and stop new profiles from popping up.

      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication: Adding a second step to your login process, like a text code or app confirmation, can stop hackers even if they know your password. Turn this on for email, banking, and any service that stores your sensitive info.",
      "4. Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements every few days. Set up alerts for any activity, and if you're not actively applying for credit, consider freezing your credit reports with all three bureaus.",
      "5. Use alias email addresses:\u00a0Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking. This helps keep your primary inbox private and makes it easier to trace which services may be leaking or selling your information. If one alias starts receiving junk mail or suspicious messages, you can simply delete it without affecting your main account. It's one of the simplest ways to\u00a0reduce spam and protect your digital identity.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "6. Don't click suspicious links or attachments,\u00a0and use strong antivirus software: Phishing attempts often look convincing, especially if scammers already know your name or other details. If something feels off, delete the message and go directly to the website instead of clicking the link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Be cautious about what you post publicly: Avoid sharing your birthday, hometown, full name, or photos of your home or license plates. Social media platforms are heavily scraped by bots and bad actors looking to compile detailed profiles.",
      "8. Block robocalls and filter scam numbers: A surge in robocalls is a strong sign your phone number is being sold or shared by data brokers. These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include\u00a0fake IRS agents,\u00a0tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam. Check out how to get rid of robocalls with apps and data removal services.",

      "With the increasing sophistication of digital threats, safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial. Android is responding with a suite of new security features designed to protect you from scams, fraud, and device theft.",
      "These enhancements are primarily rolling out to devices running Android 16. Some protections, such as enhanced theft protection and AI-powered scam detection, are also becoming available on select devices running Android 10 and later via Google Play Services updates.",
      "The most advanced features, including Identity Check and device-level Advanced Protection, are initially launching on Google Pixel and Samsung devices with One UI 7, with plans to expand to other manufacturers as they update to Android 16. Let's take a look at how these innovations are making Android security smarter and more comprehensive.",

      "Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1. Smarter protections against phone call scams",
      "Phone scammers are becoming increasingly creative, often attempting to trick people into changing device security settings or granting risky permissions during calls. Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts. If you're screen-sharing during a call, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends.",

      "2. Smarter scam detection in Google Messages",
      "Android's AI-powered\u00a0Scam Detection in Google Messages and Phone by Google is now even more intelligent. It can identify suspicious conversation patterns in real-time and warn you before you fall victim to a scam. This protection covers a wide range of scams, including toll road and billing fee scams, cryptocurrency scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, tech support scams, and more. All message analysis happens on your device, so your conversations stay private.",
      "Availability can vary depending on your device, region, and carrier. If you don't see these features yet, make sure your\u00a0app is updated and keep an eye out as Google continues to expand support to more users worldwide.",
      "Scam Detection (Google)",
      "3. Fighting fraud and impersonation with Key Verifier",
      "To help protect you from scammers who try to impersonate someone you know, Android is rolling out Key Verifier in Google Messages. This feature lets you and your contact verify each other's identity using public encryption keys, either by scanning a QR code or comparing numbers. If a contact's verification status changes, like after a SIM swap, you'll see a warning, giving you extra confidence that you're talking to the right person.",

      "If you've ever used Android's\u00a0Find My Device to track down a lost phone or set of keys, you know how helpful it can be. Now, Find My Device is evolving into\u00a0Find Hub, making it easier to keep track of your devices, family, and friends all in one place, with more partner brands joining the network.",
      "Find Hub is also becoming more personalized. Whether you want built-in luggage tracking from\u00a0July and\u00a0Mokobara, ski protection with\u00a0Peak integration, or Disney-themed Bluetooth tags from Pixbee, there are options to suit different needs. Soon, tags that are enabled with ultra-wideband, starting with moto tag, will provide improved nearby location tracking.",
      "Later this year, Find Hub will include satellite connectivity, allowing you to stay connected with friends and family even when cellular service is unavailable. For travelers, new partnerships with airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and Singapore Airlines will let you share your Bluetooth tag's location directly with these airlines. This should make recovering lost luggage easier and less stressful.",

      "Whether you're a journalist, a public figure, or just want extra peace of mind, Android 16 makes it easy to activate Advanced Protection.

      "Advanced Protection (Google)",
      "Optional: Review additional settings",
      "You can review and adjust related security settings within the Advanced Protection menu, such as app permissions and network controls, as new features become available. If you don't see the option, make sure your device is updated to Android 16 and check for any additional requirements, such as a Google account or specific device compatibility.

Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough.

So, you may want to choose a strong antivirus app and keep it updated for maximum protection.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Keep your device updated: Always install the latest\u00a0Android updates to patch any security vulnerabilities. Updates often include important security fixes that protect against new threats. To do this, go to\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0System or\u00a0About phone, select\u00a0Software update or\u00a0System update, then tap\u00a0Download and Install if an update is available.",

      "Be cautious with app permissions: Only grant apps the permissions they truly need. Review permissions regularly and revoke any that seem unnecessary or intrusive.",

      "Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra step to your logins, making it more difficult for others to access your accounts. Most major apps and services offer this feature in their security settings.",
      "Download apps only from the Google Play Store: Avoid third-party stores, which are more likely to host unsafe apps. The Play Store has security checks that help reduce the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "Regularly review your privacy settings: Make sure you're comfortable with what you're sharing. Adjust settings to limit data sharing and enhance your privacy whenever possible.",
      "Consider a personal data removal service: Scammers often start by gathering information about you from public records and data broker sites. Using a personal data removal service can help scrub your personal details from these sites, making it much harder for scammers to target you. If you're concerned about your privacy or just want to take your security to the next level, this is a smart step to consider.",

      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana.

      "Scammers aren\u2019t just targeting charities. They\u2019re after anyone and everyone. Here are a few ways to protect yourself and keep your hard-earned money safe.",
      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "4) Create a strong, unique and complex password for each of your mobile payment apps and change it often. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

      "Hugging Face, a well-known name in AI development, is making big moves in the world of robotics. The company has just introduced two open-source humanoid robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini, designed to make advanced robotics more accessible to everyone, from researchers and developers to students and hobbyists.",

      "HopeJR is\u00a0Hugging Face's new full-size humanoid robot. It stands out for its impressive 66 actuated degrees of freedom. This means it can walk, move its arms, and perform a wide range of independent gestures, making it a versatile platform for research, experimentation, and even household tasks in the future. Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000. That is a fraction of what most full-scale humanoid robots cost, opening the door for smaller labs, schools, and dedicated enthusiasts to get involved in advanced robotics development.",

It can move its head, listen, speak, and interact with AI applications, making it a fun and practical tool for developers and educators alike.",
      "Reachy Mini is expected to cost between $250 and $300. It is designed to be a hands-on gateway into robotics, letting users build, customize, and experiment with embodied AI.

      "Both HopeJR and Reachy Mini are fully open source. This means anyone can assemble, rebuild, and understand how these robots work. Hugging Face's CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized that this approach helps keep robotics open and accessible rather than dominated by a handful of companies with proprietary black-box systems. The community-driven model encourages collaboration and innovation, allowing users to share their improvements and build on each other's work.",

      "\"There is quite a bit of that sextortion, as well as various different things and the use of encoded language,\" Boyce explained, pointing to the use of communicating through memes and coded language.",
      "The group\u2019s endgame can be especially tragic. In some cases, the 764 network pushes its victims toward livestreamed self-harm and even suicide. \"They do promote self-harm,\" he said. \"Children have been asked to self-harm and write their name in their own blood.\"",

      "As tensions rise about who is behind the violent anti-ICE riots, a California-based company that specializes in providing on-demand crowds for protests says there are indicators to spot the difference between hired demonstrators and normal crowds.",
      "\"We receive inquiries regarding practically every major social cause imaginable, and the anti-ICE demonstrations are no exception,\" Adam Swart, the CEO and founder of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital. \"The fact that we receive requests does not mean we take them, in many cases because the budget does not match the ambition.\"",
      "Swart added that they have received \"numerous high budget requests\" regarding the anti-ICE demonstrations, but declined those offers due to the fact \"that they do not want to get close to any form of illegal activity, including violence, vandalism or blocking off roads without a permit.\"",
      "Swart, who started Crowds on Demand in 2012 when he was a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to \"change how advocacy is done,\" shared how they support causes and how to spot if these protests are tied to other companies and organizations.",
      "Spotting \u2018bad actors\u2019",

      "Several cars burn on the street during clashes between protesters and police on June 8, 2025, in Downtown Los Angeles. (Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)",
      "\"Now what you're seeing from the agitators should not be logged in with the broader protest movement, and that is because there is a group of agitators who attach themselves to every cause and use that cause as an excuse to loot, to be violent, and to create disruption,\" Swart said.",
      "\"They do not care about those causes, they merely care about looting and destruction. These are pirates. These are psychopaths, and their behavior should not be tolerated, and their actions should not be used to delegitimize peaceful demonstrators.\"",
      "Swart said that some of these groups have informants inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "\"Activist groups are (likely) receiving tipoffs about ICE raid locations, allowing them to stage protests before law enforcement even arrives,\" Swart shared.",
      "\"I strongly believe that there are ICE informants who are providing information to demonstrators about the locations of the raids. The reason why I believe that is that there were hundreds of demonstrators that showed up with just a few minutes' notice at the locations of the raids. That is difficult to do,\" he continued.",
      "Swart said this is all speculation on his part, and he has no specific information on how the riots might be funded.",
      "\"While I don't have direct information that the protesters are being paid, I strongly believe that many of the protesters are being compensated,\" he explained. \"How do I know this? Because when you can gather hundreds of people at the wee hours of the morning or the late hours of night with zero notice with just a text message within a 10-minute period, that sounds a lot more like a rapid reaction force than a group of passionate demonstrators.\"",
      "Swart said to also look out for legal payouts that are \"disguised as support.\"",
      "\"Instead of direct cash payments, groups offer expensive legal defense packages and luxury accommodations as a workaround \u2013 compensating illegal action without ever calling it that,\" Swart explained.",
      "Swart said another giveaway is the hotel accommodations that are arranged for violent rioters.",
      "\"Expect to see protest leaders put up in boutique hotels \u2018awaiting trial.\u2019 It\u2019s a tactic increasingly used to reward aggressive participants without raising legal red flags,\" he explained.",
      "\"It is perfectly acceptable for people to express concern regarding ICE activities and regarding the Trump administration's border policies and immigration policies, but any form of violence, blocking off streets, and vandalism is not only illegal and not only disruptive, but it actually undermines the very cause that they are seeking to promote,\" Swart said.",
      "Tactical gear is a red flag",
      "Swart said the most important factor to determine whether these rioters are being funded is the use of tactical gear.",
      "\"Another tip that these guys are funded is the fact that they have tactical gear. Tactical gear is extremely expensive and the fact they're passing out hundreds of tactical gear uniforms is an indication that there's some money. Who is funding these groups?\" Swart questioned.",

And we need to move very quickly to understand who are the forces that are trying to undermine this country.\"",
      "California lawmakers need to address real issue",
      "Swart said that what these violent protests are doing is turning people away from the cause and deterring the public from wanting to support their mission.",
      "\"Blocking streets is not the way you do that, you know? The way you do that is respectful advocacy, communication, and it's hard to say Trump is the agent of chaos when it's people who are on your side who are throwing Molotov cocktails, blocking streets and preventing access for single moms getting to work to pick up their kids. That doesn't sound like liberal values to me,\" Swart said.",
      "With their positions in power, Swart urged Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass to get in front of the mess and restore law and order.",
      "\"If you arrest people for violence, but then they're put back on the street in two hours, they will continue violence. If the ultimate penalty for violent offenders is some sort of diversion program with a few-hundred-dollar fine, then there will be more violence,\" Swart explained. \"So the reality is, until you increase the penalties for violence, until you have mass arrests, then nothing will change in the state of California.\"",
      "\"Gavin Newsom knows what people want. He just doesn't think they deserve it. He's kind of like this symbol of what's wrong with the Democratic Party, because he preaches a lot, but he never practices,\" Swart said. \"He never practices anything he preaches, and it's really a sad state of affairs that he has left it (California) in.\"",

      "Exiled crown prince of Iran HRH Reza Pahlavi advocates for a new future for Iran and weighs in on the possibility of the United States becoming actively involved in the Israel-Iran conflict on 'The Story.'",
      "As the Iranian regime reels from sustained Israeli strikes on military and nuclear infrastructure, debate is intensifying over what could come next.",
      "Experts say the end of the Islamic Republic is no longer unthinkable \u2014 but warn that what replaces it could either lift the country toward a freer future or plunge it into instability.",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince of Iran and a prominent opposition figure, posted yesterday, \"Sources inside Iran say that the regime\u2019s command and control structures are collapsing at a rapid pace. Meanwhile, the international community is beginning to realize that the Islamic Republic has no future. Our discussions about a post-Islamic Republic Iran have begun.\"",
      "\"The first thing is revolution is too broad a word,\" said Behnam Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"The better words are evolution and devolution, meaning if you get something better or something worse. Because this is the Middle East, and fundamentally, things can get worse, not better, when you introduce an exogenous shock.\"",

      "Taleblu cautioned that both the Iranian opposition and Western governments have failed to prepare for regime collapse because of a long-standing reluctance to engage with the idea of regime change. \"By not being able to articulate the necessary political strategy... we are most unprepared,\" he said.",
      "Beni Sabti, an Iran expert at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, sees four scenarios emerging from the current moment \u2014 one of which, he warns, is far worse than the others.",
      "\"The Iranian people are currently leaderless, low-energy, and disillusioned since the women\u2019s protests,\" Sveti told Fox News Digital. \"One scenario is collapse from within, similar to the Soviet Union. A brigade commander inside the Revolutionary Guards, supported by a circle of loyalists, could decide to rebel from within the regime.\"",
      "Sabti said that after Israel eliminated many Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) generals, Iran\u2019s regular army may now be better positioned to rise. \"It might even align with disillusioned elements of the revolutionary guards,\" he said. \"Because they know the system and its bureaucracy, insiders could quietly organize something from within. There would be casualties, but it could unfold as a relatively quiet historical event.\"",

      "Taleblu supports the idea that a regime transition could emerge from within, but notes that Iran has spent decades \"coup-proofing.\"",
      "\"It has promoted more based on zeal than capability. So it's less likely that you could have a classic military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat emerge,\" he said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen, but it would take a significant amount of politicking and maneuvering.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "The second scenario Sabti outlined is a popular uprising sparked by the release of political prisoners. \"There are many political leaders in Iranian prisons,\" he said. \"If some are freed, they could rally the public. They were once part of the regime but tried to shift course and now support relations with the U.S. It would still be a very cold peace with Israel\u2014but not hostile.\"",
      "Taleblu noted that Iranian society has already undergone a significant shift over the past decade. \"Large swaths of the Iranian population\u201480% is probably a minimum number\u2014hate this regime,\" he said. \"The protests since 2017, especially \u2018Women, Life, Freedom,\u2019 were triggered not just by politics, but by economic, social, even environmental issues.\"",
      "Iranians protest the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the morality police, in Tehran, Iran, on Oct. 1, 2022. (The Associated Press)",
      "A third possibility, Sabti said, is the return of exiled leaders. \"There\u2019s deep romantic nostalgia toward the monarchy,\" he said. \"Maybe in a later phase, if infighting breaks out, people might rally around a symbolic figure\u2014\u2018Come back and be a symbol.\u2019 That could strengthen the revolution.\"",
      "Taleblu acknowledged that figures like Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi could play a role, but not as rulers. \"Think of the diaspora as a bridgehead into a new Iran\u2014not the definers of the new Iran,\" he said. \"The people inside Iran should be the ones shaping the next Iran.\"",
      "The fourth \u2014 and worst \u2014 scenario, according to Sabti, is that the regime survives. \"That\u2019s the worst option,\" he said bluntly.",
      "EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN",
      "Taleblu agreed, warning that survival would bring an even more repressive future. \"If the Islamic Republic survives, it will survive in a more radical fashion\u2014more military, less clergy,\" he said. \"There\u2019s debate: does it become like Turkey or Pakistan, or does it become even more messianic? The older IRGC are corrupt; the younger ones are messianic.\"",
      "One of the most contentious questions looming over all these scenarios is the future role of Iran\u2019s non-Persian communities, including the Ahwazi, Baloch, Azeris, and Kurds. Aref Al-Kaabi, executive president of the State of Ahwaz, told Fox News Digital in a written statement that without trust-building between these communities and the Persian opposition, change will remain elusive.",

      "\"In my opinion, regime change in Iran is possible if the following conditions are met: continued Israeli strikes... support for non-Persian components... international will... and bridges of trust between Arabs, Kurds, Baloch, Azeris, and the Persian opposition,\" Al-Kaabi said. \"If these conditions are met, I believe the regime\u2019s fall will only be a matter of days.\"",
      "He said that in recent days, the IRGC launched widespread arrests in Ahwaz to prevent mobilization. \"Most of those arrested are Arabs from Abadan, Bushehr, Sheyban, and Shoaibiya,\" he said.",
      "Al-Kaabi also criticized the Persian opposition abroad. \"They view us\u2014Arabs, Kurds, Azeris, Baloch\u2014as separatists and refuse to work with us. That stubbornness is one of the main reasons the regime is still in power.\"",

      "If President Trump decides not to order a strike on Iran\u2019s main underground enrichment site at Fordow, Israel has a number of options to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain south of Tehran.",
      "One option includes sending elite Israeli Air Force commandos from Unit 5101, known as Shaldag, which, in Hebrew, means kingfisher, a bird known to be patient and dive deep under water to find its prey.",
      "In September, members of this\u00a0elite\u00a0unit surprised the world by entering an underground missile factory used by Iran in Syria.",
      "\"There was a site that similarly looked like Fordow,\" former Israeli Military Intelligence Chief Amos Yadlin told Fox News in an exclusive interview.\u00a0 \"Even though smaller, the Syrian facility produced advanced ballistic missiles, precise ballistic missiles using Iranian technology, as well as Iranian money.\"",

      "Israel attacked the site from the air a few times but was not able to destroy the site.",
      "Unit 5101 (Shaldag) used the cover of darkness and diversionary airstrikes to enter the secret site, plant explosives and destroy the complex. Like Iran's Fordow mountain complex south of Tehran, it was 300 feet underground.",

      "It's not the first time Israel has had to plan to take out a secret nuclear complex against the odds and alone. In 1981, Israel flew a daring mission to bomb Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak.",

      "In 1981, Israel flew a daring mission to bomb Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak. Yadlin was one of eight young Israeli F-16 pilots who carried out the secret attack. (Amos Yadlin)",
      "\"We didn't have air refueling at that time. We didn't have GPS. It was dumb bombs, smart pilot, but a very difficult operational mission when Iraq was in a war (with Iran). So, the state of alert was very, very high,\" Yadlin recalled. He and the other pilots believed it might be a suicide mission, and they might not have enough fuel to return home.",
      "More recently, retired Maj. Gen. Yadlin served as the head of Israel's Military Intelligence in 2007, when Israel blew up a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor that the world did not know about. The White House at the time did not want to assist in the strike. Yadlin has seen history change after Israel has acted alone carrying out daring missions like the exploding pagers that killed most of the top commanders of Iran\u2019s proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.",
      "WHY US MUST DESTROY IRAN'S FORDOW NUCLEAR FACILITY NOW",
      "In 2008, when it was determined that Israeli F-16s could not reach Iran's nuclear sites, Yadlin ordered Mossad to come up with another way to take out Iran's uranium enrichment at Natanz. Two years later, Israeli and American cyber warriors introduced Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm that caused thousands of Natanz centrifuges to spin out of control, setting back Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment.",
      "More recently, retired Maj. Gen. Yadlin served as the head of Israel's Military Intelligence in 2007, when Israel blew up a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor that the world did not know about.\u00a0 (Amos Yadlin)",
      "The decision to strike Fordow, the crown jewel and heart of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, is different, and Israel prefers the U.S. to use its B-2 stealth bombers and 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs.",
      "\"Anybody who wants the war to be over soon, to be finished quickly, have to find a way to deal with Fordow,\" Yadlin said. \"Those who think that attacking Fordow will escalate the war, in my judgment, it can de-escalate and terminate the war.\"",
      "And it could serve as a deterrent to China and Russia, who will see the power and capability of the U.S. military\u2019s unique capability.",

      "Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, but experts told CNBC that it\u2019s also the one with the most to lose.",
      "In a major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country\u2019s parliament on Sunday reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, risking alienating its neighbors and trade partners.",
      "The decision to close the waterway now rests with the the country\u2019s national security council, and its possibility has raised the specter of higher energy prices and aggravated geopolitical tensions, with Washington calling upon Beijing to prevent the strait\u2019s closure.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "Russia watches on as ally Iran is pummeled \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely to go to Tehran\u2019s rescueDollar surge could be short-lived after U.S. strike on IranOil at $100 a barrel? U.S. role in Iran-Israel fight fuels market jitters",
      "Russia watches on as ally Iran is pummeled \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely to go to Tehran\u2019s rescue",
      "Dollar surge could be short-lived after U.S. strike on Iran",
      "Oil at $100 a barrel? U.S. role in Iran-Israel fight fuels market jitters",
      "Vandana Hari, founder of energy intelligence firm Vanda Insights, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Asia\u201d that the possibility of closure remains \u201cabsolutely minimalistic.\u201d",
      "If Iran blocks the strait, the country risks turning its neighboring oil-producing countries into enemies and risks hostilities with them, she said.",
      "Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed that Iran had shipped 1.5 million barrels per day via the Strait of Hormuz in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Furthermore, a closure would also provoke Iran\u2019s market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports.",
      "\u201cSo very, very little to be achieved, and a lot of self-inflicted harm that Iran could do,\u201d Hari said.",
      "Her view is supported by Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at advisory firm Signum Global Advisors.",
      "Iran will not want to antagonize China, he said, adding that disrupting supplies will also \u201cput a target\u201d on the country\u2019s own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime \u201cat a time when there is little reason to doubt U.S. and Israeli resolve in being \u2018trigger-happy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Clayton Seigle, senior fellow for Energy Security and Climate Change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that as China is \u201cvery dependent\u201d on oil flows from the Gulf, not just Iran, \u201cits national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait.\u201d",
      "There are currently no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing through the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center. \u201cU.S. associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption, which is a positive sign for the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Impact of potential disruptions",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and about 20% of the world\u2019s oil transits the waterway. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the \u201cworld\u2019s most important oil transit chokepoint.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s operations in and around Hormuz are unlikely to be \u2018all or nothing\u2019 \u2014 but instead move along a sliding scale from total disruption to none at all,\u201d said Signum\u2019s Bishop.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy [for Iran] would be to rattle Hormuz oil flows just enough to hurt the U.S. via moderate upward price movement, but not enough to provoke a major U.S. response against Iran\u2019s oil production and export capacity,\u201d he added.",
      "On Sunday, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a post on X that pump prices in the U.S. could climb to $3.35-$3.50 per gallon in the days ahead, compared with the national average of $3.139 for the week of June 16.",
      "Should Iran decide to close the strait, it would most likely use small boats for a partial blockade, or for a more complete solution, mine the waterway, according to David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy.",
      "In a Sunday note, S&P Global Commodity Insights wrote that any Iranian closure of the strait would affect not only Iran\u2019s own exports, but also those of nearby Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "That would potentially remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, and affect regional refineries by causing feedstock shortages, the research firm said. The disruption to supply would impact Asia and Europe as well as North America.",
      "Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be \u201cseverely impacted,\u201d S&P said, with Qatar\u2019s gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe.",
      "Qatar\u2019s LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.",
      "\u201cAlternative supply routes for Middle Eastern oil and gas are limited, with pipeline capacity insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,\u201d S&P added.",
      "The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pointed out that \u201cthere is limited scope to bypass the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d Pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have only a spare capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day between them, while the strait oversees the transport of an estimated 20 million barrels of oil and oil products per day, the bank said in a note.",
      "All these present upside risk to energy prices, with Goldman Sachs estimating that the market is pricing in a geopolitical risk premium of $12.",
      "If oil flows through the strait were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down by 10% for another 11 months, Brent is forecast to \u201cbriefly jump\u201d to a peak of around $110, Goldman said.",
      "Brent oil futures currently stand at $78.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures were trading at $75.75."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are seizing on Donald Trump\u2019s surprise attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities to make the case that the world is becoming more dangerous on his watch, not less, and that he is reneging on a promise to avoid foreign military interventions.",
      "The argument strikes at Trump\u2019s contention that his blend of negotiating skills and toughness is enough to keep the United States safe.",
      "In the space of a few days, Trump has made the United States a combatant in another Middle East war that exposes soldiers to potential deadly reprisals, Democrats contend.",
      "In a statement, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin pointed to Trump's inaugural address, in which he said he would measure his success by \u201cthe wars we never get into.\u201d",
      "Yet, Martin said, \u201cagainst his own words, the president sent bombers into Iran. Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Several lawmakers said Sunday that they will press the Trump administration for clarity about the attack on Iran and the endgame he envisions. But they are also using the moment to try to undercut Trump's standing with those who voted for him in the hope he would not get entangled in foreign wars.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said Trump's commitment was \"to get us out of foreign wars.\"",
      "\"Say what you want about Joe Biden, Joe Biden didn\u2019t start any wars,\" Smith said. \"He got us out of the one war that we were in [in Afghanistan]. Trump has now started a war with Iran.\u201d",
      "Justifying the strike, Trump administration officials said the United States has crippled an Iranian nuclear program that poses a worldwide threat.",
      "But the attack could also invite retaliatory strikes against U.S. service members and assets in the region and perhaps even the homeland.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that while he hopes for the best after the attacks, \u201chistory suggests that you better be well aware of the fact that the best-case scenario almost never happens.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that the Iranians have a lot more missiles than we think they do and we end up with dead soldiers and sailors in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Before Trump ordered the strike, Iran had sent a private message warning him that the regime could unleash terrorist attacks in the United States by activating sleeper cells inside the country, according to two U.S. officials and a person with knowledge of the threat.",
      "What's more, Trump\u2019s State Department put out a warning to Americans worldwide Sunday that they face heightened risk due to the Iranian conflict.",
      "Democrats are also condemning Trump's methods in carrying out the attack, saying he should have sought congressional authorization under the War Powers Act.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump's unilateral actions are grounds for impeachment.",
      "\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" she wrote on X.",
      "In an interview, Darin Selnick, a former senior Defense Department official under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said he trusted that Trump acted because there was no other choice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a world of classified and secret information that we don\u2019t know about but the president does,\u201d Selnick said. \u201cKnowing the president, I know he did not make this decision lightly, he did not make it quickly, and he tried every other option before he went down this road and wouldn\u2019t have gone down this road unless he felt he absolutely had to do it.\u201d",
      "A handful of Democrats have voiced support for the strikes, including Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, as well as Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada.",
      "Whether Trump sees the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities as a one-off or a precursor to deeper U.S. involvement is unclear. He and his senior officials put out conflicting messages Sunday about Iran\u2019s fate.",
      "After Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance said they had no interest in ousting Iran\u2019s leadership in favor of a more palatable regime, Trump suggested that his goal may be more far-reaching. He wrote on social media that he might want to see new leadership in Iran and floated potential \"regime change.\"",
      "\u201cMake Iran Great Again,\u201d he wrote in a twist on his old campaign slogan.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: \u201cThere needs to be a classified briefing of Congress and a public explanation to the American people about the strategy for protecting American troops and personnel, as well as seeking peace and stability in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about conquering danger, but so far it seems to be his fantasy, not reality. The way to really surmount danger would be to stand up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, the White House leaned on Vance, who has long been a skeptic of foreign intervention, to defend Trump's decision.",
      "\u201cI certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East,\u201d Vance said Sunday on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI understand the concern, but the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents, and now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America\u2019s national security objectives.\u201d",
      "He also insisted the current conflict \"is not going to be some long, drawn-out thing.\"",
      "As a candidate, Trump said Biden\u2019s fecklessness had contributed to global instability. He often says the pair of wars that started under Biden \u2014 Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel \u2014 would not have happened had he been president.",
      "\u201cThe war between Russia and Ukraine is Biden\u2019s war, not mine. I just got here and for four years during my term had no problem in preventing it from happening,\u201d Trump said in April. \"President Putin and everyone else respected your president!\u201d",
      "Yet Trump\u2019s efforts to broker peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have faltered, a point that Democrats are quick to note.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that wars have escalated,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who is helping lead the push for Trump to seek approval for military action. \"The war in Gaza continues. The war in Ukraine continues. And now we\u2019re at war with Iran. This is a complete abdication of Trump\u2019s promise to end wars abroad and focus on investing in American communities.\u201d",
      "Democrats, he continued, need to sweep aside leaders who have tolerated such conflicts and develop \u201ca changed message around not having more of these endless wars of choice in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he plans to force a vote this week on his resolution to block Trump from taking military action in Iran unless the House and the Senate approve it first.",
      "\"I fear deeply we're being misled about this, just as we were before we tragically got into a war with Iraq,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" invoking a war that is now deeply unpopular with much of Trump's base.",
      "A successful military operation reflects well on the commander in chief. In his nationwide televised address Saturday night, Trump declared that the strike \"obliterated\" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. If that judgment proves premature \u2014 if Iran restores its nuclear program \u2014 his triumphalism could boomerang.",
      "A Republican president from another era, George W. Bush, learned the hard way that it is best to be circumspect before proclaiming \"mission accomplished\" in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe business about \u2018obliterated,\u2019 that\u2019s Trump,\" said Elliott Abrams, who was a special representative for Iran in the State Department during Trump\u2019s first term and who also worked in the Bush White House. \"Somebody wrote that line for him or it came from him naturally.",
      "\u201cWe may well have [destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities], but there\u2019s no way to know that yet,\u201d added Abrams, who is now senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations."

      "Stocks opened flat.",
      "The current oil price is still the highest since late January \u2014 but is only slightly below the overall average seen since 2023. It would equate to gasoline prices of about $3.30 a gallon, assuming oil prices stay at these levels.",
      "That would be a big assumption.",
      "Wall Street analysts say that by ordering the strikes, President Donald Trump has once again injected massive uncertainty into markets after having already done so with his on-again, off-again tariff announcements.",
      "\u201cThere is in our view a wide range of outcomes for oil prices in the next few weeks,\u201d analysts with UBS financial group wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe nature and extent of Iranian retaliation remains the key parameter.\u201d",
      "If the Iranian response somehow stays muted, oil prices could actually fall back down, the analysts said.",
      "But the U.S. strikes have likely increased the risk to disruptions of energy infrastructure in the Middle East, they wrote. If any such disruption were to occur, oil prices would surge in the short term.",
      "\"EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I\u2019M WATCHING! YOU\u2019RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON\u2019T DO IT!\" Trump posted to social media Monday morning.",
      "The biggest focus remains on whether Iran will limit or cut-off access to the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint in the Persian Gulf through which about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply travels. Iran\u2019s state-owned media reported that Iran\u2019s parliament backed closing the strait \u2014 but that the final decision lies with Iran\u2019s national security council, according to the report. There was no word yet that such an order had been given.",
      "UBS said it sees a disruption of the strait as \u201clow probability\u201d at this point. An early-morning report that six tankers had begun moving away from the strait was updated just before 9 a.m. to show that three of the vessels had reversed course and were heading back to the strait.",
      "\u201cThe strait is critical for Iran\u2019s own exports as its terminal outside of the Strait only has limited capacity,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cA closure would also have a material negative impact for several other countries such as Qatar and China and would likely present a challenge for Iran.\u201d",
      "Analysts with ING financial group outlined four possible avenues for Iran: full escalation that also draws in other nations such as China or Russia; disruption of the Strait of Hormuz; active or passive support for terrorist attacks in the U.S. and Europe; or taking no action at all.",
      "\u201cWe will abstain from speculating about the next steps and instead conclude that the most likely economic consequences from the US strikes will be on general uncertainty and on the price of oil,\u201d the ING analysts wrote."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to order strikes in Iran \u2014 among the most consequential he has made as commander in chief \u2014 is the latest example of a U.S. president\u2019s taking military action without first seeking congressional approval. And experts say that, while his power over American armed forces isn\u2019t absolute, there\u2019s most likely little lawmakers will do.",
      "Trump is supposed to submit to Congress a legal justification for having bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities within 48 hours after the operation began. Unlike tangible consequences Trump has faced for other moves in which he tested the bounds of executive power \u2014 such as court rulings against him \u2014 any price he might pay for this decision would largely play out in the American political arena and on the world stage, where the U.S. reputation is on the line.",
      "\u201cPresidents over the last 25 years have certainly been stretching the envelope of presidential authority to use force,\u201d John Bellinger, adjunct senior fellow for international and national security law at the Council on Foreign Relations, told NBC News. \u201cUsing force more and more, deploying the military more and more, without congressional authority \u2014 and Congress, with a few persistent objectors, has simply acquiesced in that.\u201d",
      "The limits on presidential power to use military force are set out in sections of the U.S. Constitution, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the United Nations Charter.",
      "Article 1 of the Constitution makes it clear: Congress \u2014 and no other part of the federal government \u2014 has the power to declare war. But that\u2019s something Congress hasn\u2019t formally done in more than 80 years, since World War II.",
      "While Congress has approved what are called Authorizations of Military Force and appropriated funds to assist in ongoing conflicts, its ability to control when the nation is at war has been diminished, in part by its own actions, while the power of the office of the president has expanded.",
      "The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a law designed to provide a check on the president\u2019s power to involve the United States in military action without the consent of Congress. It was passed over President Richard Nixon\u2019s veto in the wake of the Vietnam War, which Congress never actually declared as a war, though it did authorize force in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.",
      "According to the War Powers Resolution, \u201cin any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced\u201d when war hasn\u2019t been declared, the president has 48 hours to notify, in writing, the speaker of the House and the Senate president pro tempore. The act requires that the notification include why the president took the action, the authority under which it was taken and \u201cthe estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement.\u201d And the resolution also says any time a president uses the armed forces without notifying Congress beforehand, that use must be terminated within 60 days.",
      "Bellinger said any notification to Congress that Trump sends, which Bellinger told NBC News the Justice Department is likely to prepare, will probably rely on the authority granted to the president in Article II of the Constitution, which makes the president the commander in chief. President Joe Biden cited Article II in 2021 after he ordered strikes in Iraq and Syria that he said were targeting an \u201cIranian-backed militia group responsible for recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.\u201d",
      "Presidents testing limits",
      "Though Congress acted after the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam to restrain presidents in their use of military force, recent decades have seen presidents push against those restraints.",
      "On March 23, 1999, the Senate approved NATO airstrikes against what was then Yugoslavia to force a Serbian withdrawal from the province of Kosovo. But when the strikes began 24 hours later, the House had yet to approve the resolution, and a month later, in a tie vote, it rejected the Senate resolution amid increased concerns of greater U.S. military involvement in the area.",
      "In March 2011, a coalition of NATO forces, which included the United States, began a military campaign to intervene in the Libyan civil war to protect civilians. While President Barack Obama ordered it, he didn\u2019t seek advance approval from Congress. By June, the House had passed a resolution calling for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region and demanded that the Obama administration explain why it didn\u2019t ask Congress for permission first.",
      "In April 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term, he didn\u2019t seek congressional authorization before he ordered a missile strike in Syria in response to the Syrian government\u2019s use of chemical weapons. \u201cIt is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,\u201d he said in televised remarks after the strikes.",
      "Bellinger, who helped draft Authorizations for Military Force under President George W. Bush, said it isn\u2019t always that way. On Jan. 12, 1991, the Senate voted in favor of a resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in response to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, after President George H.W. Bush asked it to do so. In September 2001 and again in October 2002, President George W. Bush asked Congress to authorize the use of armed force, first in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and then to target Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi government.",
      "\u201cTo strike a country like Iran, I think this does go far beyond what other presidents have done,\u201d Bellinger said.",
      "Congress, however, may not have the appetite to fight Trump over it.",
      "\u201cGiven that a lot of people in Congress tend not to want to buck the president or obviously some of them agree with his actions anyway,\u201d Curtis Bradley, a professor at University of Chicago Law School, said in an interview, \u201cit seems unlikely at the moment that Congress would, you know, use its statutory powers to try to end or restrict the conflict.\u201d",
      "U.S. courts are also unlikely to get involved. The judicial branch has limited authority over a president when it comes to his decisions about military action and the use of force.",
      "\u201cThe lower courts, when they get these cases, tend to say, sorry, this is very complicated,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThey say it\u2019s really to be resolved by the political institutions and not the courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if it is unconstitutional, I don\u2019t see it\u2019s likely that courts will be the ones to police that,\u201d he added.",
      "The U.N.",
      "International law, including the U.N. Charter, lays out very clearly what is and isn\u2019t justified when a country decides to use force.",
      "Article II of the U.N. Charter orders \u201call members\u201d to settle their international disputes \u201cby peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.\u201d",
      "While a separate section of the U.N. Charter allows for military action to be taken in self-defense, experts say, that argument will be harder for the Trump administration to make in this scenario.",
      "\u201cThe idea that you could just ... attack because, in the long run, you think your strategic interests will be harmed does not fit with the charter under anybody\u2019s reasonable definition of self-defense,\u201d Bradley said.",
      "But what does a violation of the U.N. Charter mean? Not much, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time, unfortunately, where the U.S. is doing something that probably violates the charter,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThat ends up being more about diplomacy, rather than something that would directly stop a president from acting.\u201d",
      "Bellinger believes that even without any direct domestic or international legal consequences, the implications of Trump\u2019s decisions are wide-ranging. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a political cost at home, and it\u2019s going to be more of a reputational cost for the United States around the world.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Oil prices jumped and stock futures slipped Sunday evening, indicating concern among investors about the possibility of economic fallout from the ongoing unrest in the Middle East following U.S. strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The major focus is on oil. Iran remains a major international oil supplier, and it also sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a heavily trafficked waterway in the Persian Gulf that is a key transit channel for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "Concerns centered on whether Iran would begin limiting or shutting down access to the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that closing the strait would be tantamount to \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Iran and called on China, Iran\u2019s top trading partner, to head off any attempt by Iran to affect traffic.",
      "U.S. and global oil benchmark prices opened up 4% Sunday evening, underscoring the concerns about what the conflict means for the world\u2019s oil supplies. Those gains had eased slightly by 9 p.m. Sunday. Oil prices already gained about 3% last week in the wake of Israel\u2019s initial strikes against Iranian targets and Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile attacks.",
      "Stocks also slid Sunday. S&P 500 futures contracts opened about 0.6% in the first hour of trading, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell about 250 points, or 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.7%. Like oil, they had pared those opening losses somewhat by 9 p.m. U.S. markets officially open at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\u201cShould oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz be affected, we could easily see $100 oil\u201d or an increase in U.S. gas prices by 75 cents per gallon, Andy Lipow, president of the consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, said in a note to clients Sunday.",
      "In a worst-case scenario in which oil prices rose to at least $120 a barrel, U.S. gas prices would increase as much as $1.25 per gallon, Lipow said.",
      "In a follow-up email, Lipow said that even if the strait does not officially close, any action by a tanker company to pre-emptively reduce its footprint there represents \u201da de facto supply disruption.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s state-owned media reported that Iran\u2019s parliament backed closing the strait \u2014 but that the final decision lies with Iran\u2019s national security council, according to the report.",
      "Any move by Iran to alter traffic in the strait could also hurt its own economy \u2014 particularly commerce with China.",
      "On Sunday, a department of the U.K. Royal Navy said it observed \u201celectronic interference in the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d At least two massive supertankers that had entered the strait were reported to have made U-turns. Marine tracking websites also showed the vessels turning about halfway through the strait.",
      "\u201cI encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. China is Iran\u2019s most important oil customer, and they maintain friendly relations.",
      "Iran may still be assessing the ultimate damage to its nuclear facilities as it contemplates its next move. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that while it had confirmed that the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had been hit, it was not immediately possible to assess the damage at the Fordo site.",
      "Until last week, U.S. stocks had been enjoying a substantial, if volatile, recovery from the lows following President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs announcement in April. That momentum reversed after Israel announced last weekend it had struck key Iranian military and nuclear targets, prompting retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli targets by Iran.",
      "JPMorgan analysts said Sunday that investors had voiced concerns to them last week that the Iran-Israel conflict would spread, \u201cand those concerns have been materialized.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s statement that this might be the only US attack or might begin a series of attacks brought us little certainty,\u201d the analysts added in a note to clients. \u201cMoreover, we do not see an obvious route to a political settlement to the military conflict, which makes us think the conflict, like the one in Gaza, could last longer than many investors think.\u201d",
      "Year to date, the S&P 500 is up less than 2%."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is facing political headwinds for his \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d as Republican leaders hope to begin votes on it in the Senate this week.",
      "Specifically, five new surveys indicate that the GOP is losing the battle of public opinion on a major piece of legislation they\u2019re aiming to pass by July 4.",
      "Nonpartisan polls released this month show that voters have a negative perception of the bill. The House-passed version, which is facing modest revisions in the Senate, would extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts while slashing taxes on tips and overtime, and enact a series of spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs.",
      "A Fox News poll found that 38% of registered voters support the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d based on what they know about it, while 59% oppose it.",
      "The survey found that the legislation is unpopular across demographic, age and income groups. It is opposed 22%-73% by independents, and 43%-53% among white men without a college degree, the heart of Trump\u2019s base.",
      "A Quinnipiac University poll found that 27% of registered voters support the bill, while 53% oppose it. Another 20% had no opinion. Among independents, 20% said they support it and 57% said they oppose it.",
      "A KFF poll found that 35% of adults have a favorable view when asked about the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d while 64% have an unfavorable view. Just 27% of independents said they hold a favorable view of it.",
      "A survey from Pew Research Center found that 29% of adults favor the bill, while 49% oppose it. (Another 21% said they weren\u2019t sure.) Asked what impact it would have on the country, 54% said \u201ca mostly negative effect,\u201d 30% said \u201ca mostly positive effect\u201d and 12% said \u201cnot much of an effect.\u201d",
      "A poll by The Washington Post and Ipsos found that 23% of adults support \u201cthe budget bill changing tax, spending and Medicaid policies,\u201d while 42% oppose it. Another 34% had no opinion.",
      "The bill reduces Medicaid spending through new work requirements and eligibility rules. Overall, the House-passed version is projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe great, big, beautiful bill will grow the economy like it has never been grown before,\u201d Trump, who has pushed hard for its passage, wrote earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "In a recent NBC News Decision Desk poll asking Americans what issue matters most to them, 51% picked \u201cmaintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid,\u201d 21% picked \u201ccontinuing and expanding income tax cuts and credits\u201d enacted by Trump in 2017, and 28% picked \u201censuring that the national debt is reduced.\u201d",
      "The Senate is eyeing some changes to the House\u2019s bill, but nothing that alters its basic structure. For instance, the Senate is weighing less aggressive cuts to clean energy funding and more aggressive Medicaid spending reductions.",
      "Senate GOP leaders are hoping to hold a vote on the package this week. They can only afford three defections, assuming all Democrats oppose the bill, and several Republican senators have raised an array of concerns with it.",
      "The final product that passes the Senate will also need to go back through the House before it can go to Trump\u2019s desk for a signature.",
      "\u201cIt needs work. And they don\u2019t have 51 votes,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told NBC News, taking issue with a provision that changes how providers are taxed. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to fix the provider, the rural hospital issue. ... They cannot defund rural hospitals.\u201d",
      "There are some nuances in the polling. The Washington Post-Ipsos survey found that extending the 2017 tax cuts \u201cfor people of all income levels\u201d was popular among adults by a margin of 49%-26%, but extending them specifically for incomes above $400,000 was unpopular by a margin of 30%-49%.",
      "The Post-Ipsos poll found that 52% of Americans supported work requirements for able-bodied adults to receive Medicaid, while 33% opposed them. But that policy became unpopular when voters were told that the CBO estimates 8 million people would lose health coverage as a result of the bill: 63% said that is unacceptable, while 18% said that\u2019s acceptable. (The latest version of the bill is projected to result in more than 10 million losing their coverage, according to the CBO.)",
      "The Quinnipiac poll found that just 10% of voters want to decrease Medicaid spending, while 40% want it to stay about the same and 47% want to increase it.",
      "In recent days, the Senate bill has been scrubbed by the parliamentarian, the chamber\u2019s in-house referee tasked with ensuring all the provisions comply with the rules for the so-called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process Republicans are using to pass it. The process allows the majority party to bypass the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, effectively cutting Democrats out of the process.",
      "Some pieces of the bill have been knocked out in that process, according to a Democratic budget aide, including a provision to cut federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) spending and require states to shoulder a larger burden. That will be subject to the 60-vote threshold and removed from the bill, along with a controversial policy sought by Republicans to restrict the power of courts to issue injunctions against the federal government.",
      "Other provisions that were dropped include cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and repealing authorizations under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Senate Republican leaders hope to roll out the remaining provisions of the bill this week and begin voting on it, with the target of passing it by July 4. No votes have been scheduled yet.",
      "For now, Senate Republicans are crafting the bill with the goal of finding 51 votes in the chamber, even if that makes it unpalatable to the narrow House majority. For instance, they\u2019re slashing a $40,000 cap for state and local tax deductions down to $10,000, which a critical group of House Republicans in high-tax states have made clear is a nonstarter for them.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, slammed what he called \u201cmajor backsliding on the IRA green new scam subsidies\u201d in the House bill, calling the more modest cuts a red line for him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for a bill that does that,\u201d Roy told reporters.",
      "That sets up a confrontation with the House, where Republicans also have a narrow majority, in order to craft a version that can clear both chambers.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are planning to make the bill a centerpiece of their message to voters in the 2026 midterm election.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder the so-called moderate House Republicans continue to lie about their Tax Scam: the Big, Ugly Bill is wildly unpopular with the American public and they know their vote for it will lose them the majority next year,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Justin Chermol said in a statement."

    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "After a crisis pregnancy center settled a lawsuit over an ectopic pregnancy misdiagnosis, the centers may be changing how they handle some prenatal ultrasounds.",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest crisis pregnancy center support groups in the United States is telling its member clinics to avoid performing prenatal ultrasounds on women who they suspect have ectopic pregnancies, according to recordings obtained by NBC News of a recent presentation by a legal group that advises the faith-based nonprofits. The guidance comes in the wake of a lawsuit against a Massachusetts center that misdiagnosed an ectopic pregnancy.",
      "The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), a group that provides legal support and medical training for crisis pregnancy centers, advised members at a meeting earlier this year to proceed with caution when giving an ultrasound to a woman they suspect may have an ectopic pregnancy, calling the condition \u201cthe greatest medical and legal risk for clinics,\u201d according to the recordings of the presentation that NBC News obtained via a conference attendee.",
      "\u201cI do not want to see on any website or advertising is, \u2018Come to us and we\u2019ll rule out an ectopic,\u201d said a representative for NIFLA. \u201cIt is impossible to rule out an ectopic unless you\u2019re doing HCG,\u201d they added, referring to a blood test that measures hormone levels to confirm a pregnancy.",
      "In the Massachusetts lawsuit filed in 2023, a crisis pregnancy center was accused of failing to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy and causing a life-threatening emergency for a client. The complaint alleged that Clearway Clinic engaged in deceptive advertising, aiming to persuade women to forgo abortions rather than \u201cproviding them with the range of medically appropriate options.\u201d",
      "The plaintiff, a Worcester resident who was kept anonymous in the suit, alleged that the nurse who performed her ultrasound scan at the center \u201cdid not undertake sufficient medical measures\u201d to ensure the pregnancy was viable. The suit alleges that the woman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured about a month after the ultrasound scan, \u201ccausing massive internal bleeding and necessitating emergency surgery.\u201d",
      "After a favorable lower court ruling for the plaintiff, the crisis pregnancy center settled the case in June 2024 without admitting liability.",
      "Crisis pregnancy centers operate across the United States with the goal of persuading pregnant women to continue their pregnancies. Many open close to abortion clinics, promoting family planning services and limited health care services such as pregnancy tests and ultrasounds. Many generally don\u2019t offer regular prenatal checkups or gynecological services, nor do they offer abortion procedures, abortion medications or care for women having miscarriages.",
      "According to Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health epidemiologist at the University of Georgia College of Public Health who studies crisis pregnancy centers, many centers have advertised free ultrasounds as a way to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy and bring women through their doors.",
      "\u201cThey talk about ectopic pregnancies in their advertising and on their websites a lot,\u201d said Swartzendruber. \u201cThey use it to engage and try to motivate people to come in for an ultrasound.\u201d",
      "An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus. While the condition is rare, affecting only 1% to 2% of pregnancies, it can be life-threatening. Early in a pregnancy, symptoms can include vaginal bleeding or mild pain or cramping, but women may not realize they\u2019re experiencing an ectopic pregnancy at that stage. The condition is diagnosed by either an ultrasound, a pelvic exam or a blood test.",
      "Some of the cases NIFLA has represented clinics in have made their way to the Supreme Court, including a 2018 case that handed a major First Amendment win to crisis pregnancy centers in California. While NIFLA did not represent Clearway Clinic in the Massachusetts case, the center was listed as a member in 2023.",
      "\u201cJust as I\u2019m walking down here I had a call from a center,\u201d said one of the lawyers on the recording, recounting a story of a clinic that suspected a client had an ectopic pregnancy. \u201cThey had a woman come in who was cramping, and she said on a scale of 1 to 10, it was just below a 6. And I\u2019m like, yikes, like, I wouldn\u2019t scan her.\u201d",
      "The lawyer acknowledged the correct move would be to send the client to the emergency room.",
      "NIFLA has issued similar guidance to its member centers in the past. A 2018 document titled \u201cMedical Policies and Procedures\u201d advises centers that \u201cif a patient has symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, she will not be offered an ultrasound exam and is advised, verbally and in writing, to immediately obtain medical care.\u201d",
      "According to Swartzendruber, that guidance is not always heeded by the industry.",
      "\u201cThat seems like a very marked change, especially given that so many CPCs are using fear around ectopic pregnancy as a reason to come in and get scanned,\u201d she said.",
      "NIFLA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "NIFLA training materials presented at the meeting and obtained by NBC News say these health services create \u201caccess points\u201d to \u201chelp prevent unintended pregnancies and intervene in the lives of individuals who are most abortion vulnerable.\u201d",
      "According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, crisis pregnancy centers \u201crepresent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion care and even contraceptive options.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause the religious ideology of these centers\u2019 owners and employees takes priority over the health and well-being of the women seeking care at these centers, women do not receive comprehensive, accurate, evidence-based clinical information about all available options,\u201d says a paper published in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics.",
      "During the NIFLA panel, lawyers and a participating doctor advised centers against scanning women they suspect to have ectopic pregnancies at all.",
      "After being asked by an audience member about whether to scan a woman with low HCG levels, the hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy, a doctor urged that audience member to turn the woman away and be seen by her medical provider.",
      "Human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG, is colloquially known as the pregnancy hormone. According to the Cleveland Clinic, HCG levels rise after conception and continue to rise until about 10 weeks into pregnancy. Low or declining HCG levels can indicate a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scanning. If you\u2019ve got a level that\u2019s low like that, it could be early pregnancy, but that is one of the cardinal signs of ectopic and one of the cardinal signs of miscarriage, slowly rising HCG. Please do not,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cShe\u2019s already got a provider. Dump it back on them.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe should be going back to her provider,\u201d added a legal representative.",
      "Another slide deck from the summit, titled \u201cBonding: The Impact of Prenatal Ultrasound,\u201d advised attendees on \u201cwords to avoid for legal risk reduction\u201d during an ultrasound. The words listed are \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfine,\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cperfect.\u201d",
      "Concerns about federal privacy laws",
      "During the panel, a lawyer addressed another controversy facing the centers: federal health privacy laws. While some crisis pregnancy centers do offer limited prenatal care or gynecological services, they\u2019re usually staffed by volunteers and aren\u2019t bound by federal health privacy laws. Yet many of them state in their privacy policies that they comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. NBC News previously reported on letters to state attorneys general about potential privacy issues around centers advertising their services as \u201cHIPAA compliant.\u201d",
      "At the NIFLA meeting, representatives acknowledged the privacy concerns.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this movement not to say HIPAA, and I just finally got everybody to spell it right. So I\u2019m kind of upset,\u201d said one of the lawyers on the panel. \u201cWe want you to abide by those policies, but don\u2019t advertise yourself as HIPAA-compliant.\u201d",
      "Debra Rosen, the executive director of advocacy group Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, said this approach can be deceptive.",
      "\u201cUnregulated pregnancy clinics masquerade as medical facilities, are not covered entities under HIPAA, and for decades have vigorously pushed back against even the most basic forms of accountability,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cWomen nationwide face real harms as these fringe clinics trap them between illusions of confidentiality and the actual legal protections they receive. This dangerous gap demands legislative action.\u201d",
      "State requirements for ultrasounds",
      "While the seminar guided attendees to exercise caution around ectopic pregnancies to avoid legal liability, the NIFLA representatives also outlined the organization\u2019s opposition to legislative efforts in some states to strengthen licensing requirements around ultrasounds, mentioning bills introduced in Indiana and New Jersey that would require ultrasounds to be performed only by licensed health care professionals. While pregnancy centers do employ some medical personnel, much of the work done there is through volunteers, some with no medical background.",
      "\u201cSome of them could be pretty damaging to centers,\u201d said one representative. \u201cSo we want to make sure that if you hear of any bills in your states, we want to know about it, and we want to help you with that.\u201d",
      "An Indiana state representative, Democrat Maureen Bauer, said she introduced the bill in response to an ectopic pregnancy that was missed at a crisis pregnancy center.",
      "\u201cThat is why I filed HB 1094 to require licensure for anyone operating a sonogram machine in Indiana,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post, \u201cto ensure we do not have any more tragic stories like the young IUSB student who lost her child, and her ability to have children in the future due to a required hysterectomy, because the individual who provided her with a sonogram at a crisis pregnancy center did not identify her ectopic pregnancy.\u201d"

    "summary": "\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" explores the prequel story of Vecna, also known as Henry Creel, and how his story intersects with the lives of Joyce, Hopper and more.",
    "story": [
      "When Louis McCartney first auditioned for \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow,\u201d he taped himself reading for a part named George.",
      "The opportunity started as an email in the then 18-year-old's inbox: an untitled Netflix play, co-directed by Tony Award winner Stephen Daldry. George was described as a young kid, \"savagely loyal,\" \"escaping the shadow\" and \"living with the spirit of the boy he once was,\" McCartney tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all I knew,\" he adds.",
      "Two years later, McCartney was at the Tony Awards, nominated for best actor in a play and competing against the likes of George Clooney, winner Cole Escola and more.",
      "\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which opened in London's West End in December 2023 and then hit Broadway April 22, 2025, is a play set in the world of the hit Netflix show, which returns for its fifth and final season in November. \"George\" turned out to be a young Henry Creel, who was revealed as the big bad of the show's universe in Season 4.",
      "Henry, played in the series by Jamie Campbell Bower, is also known as One, the first of the powerful children, including Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven, tested on in Dr. Brenner's lab in Hawkins, Indiana. Henry was taken under Dr. Brenner\u2019s wing after he murdered his mother and sister using his powers of telekinesis.",
      "Henry was eventually banished to a terrifying parallel universe from which monsters like the Demogorgon and Mind Flayer originate. He transformed into a grotesque, red humanoid monster responsible for unleashing a hellscape onto Hawkins via the Upside Down, which essentially marks the intersection of the real world and that other dimension.",
      "But before Vecna, Henry was a teenage boy starting school at Hawkins High in the late 1950s.",
      "\"The whole point of the play is that we're showing that Vecna, and the psychology of that \u2014 we're taking it as a very human approach,\" McCartney says. \"The only way to do it and to explain naturally in front of you how somebody would become a world ending monster, is it needs to be the conditioning of the people around him.\"",
      "As Henry navigates being the new kid at Hawkins High, he's introduced to a veritable who's who of faces familiar to fans of the Netflix show, including a young Joyce Byers (then Joyce Maldonado), Hopper (or James Hopper Jr.), and a teenage Bob Newby. Supporting characters include Walter Henderson, Alan Munson, Ted Wheeler, Charles Sinclair and more.",
      "Essentially, the production depicts the parents from the TV series when they were just teenagers.",
      "\u201cWe try to remind the audience that these are kids,\u201d McCartney says. \u201cAnd that is the most scariest, heartbreaking thing about the play, is that they\u2019re so young, and they\u2019re dealing with so much that it\u2019s impossible for them all not to go in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "The play was written by Kate Trefry, a screenwriter on the Netflix show. She was only given a few parameters: a prequel story and the \u201850s setting.",
      "\"I was kind of given free rein from there \u2014\u00a0within the very specific confines of the material that exists already and then what's coming in Season 5,\" Trefry tells TODAY.com.",
      "Developing the Story",
      "\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" started with a pitch from British director and producer Stephen Daldry, known for \"Billy Elliot\" and \"The Crown.\" Daldry and co-director Justin Martin brought the idea to Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of the show, and together, they imagined a Henry Creel origin story.",
      "\"It became clear that it was going to be impossible for somebody who's not part of the 'Stranger Things' world to execute this if they wanted it to be canon,\" Trefry says. \"So that was when they came to me.\"",
      "Trefry, who was seven months pregnant at the time and hadn't written for the stage before, originally said no. Similarly, Josh Simon, vice president of consumer products at Netflix, reacted to the idea with a degree of nervousness.",
      "\"How are we actually going to bring this thing to life?\" he remembers thinking.",
      "It started with a script. Trefry was writing the play while she was in the writers' room for Season 5 of \"Stranger Things,\" and she felt she brought a \"privileged insight.\" While the play primarily follows Henry Creel and his friend Patty Newby (Bob's younger sister), young Joyce, Hopper and Bob are on their own journey trying to figure out what's behind a series of animal murders in Hawkins.",
      "\"I was doing so much work to think about, like, who was Joyce? If this is the beginning of Joyce\u2019s story that starts in the \u201850s, what is the perfect final arc for her and Hopper?\" Trefry recalls asking.",
      "The origins of characters like Joyce, Hopper, Bob and the parents of Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclar, Dustin Henderson and more have been a conversation in the writers' room for 10 years, Trefry says.",
      "\"If these people went to high school together, what was the 'Breakfast Club'?\" she quips.",
      "In the play, Ted Wheeler and Karen Childress are depicted as a popular attractive high school couple. Joyce leads the school play and dreams of a scholarship to attend college in Indianapolis. Sue Sinclair (then Anderson) is the senior class president. Bob is the school's radio host, and Hopper is desperate to leave Hawkins amid his father's plans to make him join the army.",
      "\"It was kind of like a writing exercise to reverse engineer personalities and say, who was this person and how did the event of the play change them to become the person that we know from the show?\" Trefry explains.",
      "Joyce grew up to be fiercely protective of her family, a trait that can be linked to the Creel family tragedy, which she, Hopper and Bob tried to prevent, Trefry says. Hopper, meanwhile, is burdened by the guilt of it all.",
      "\"That was kind of the magic trick of trying to put all of these pieces together in a way that would be really satisfying for people who know the show, but also makes sense for someone who's never seen it,\" she says.",
      "Trefry describes her first draft, which was used to pitch the play to Netflix, as \"super long\" and \"not the best.\" From there, they cast actors for each role \u2014 including Alison Jaye, currently starring as Joyce in the Broadway production \u2014 and gathered everyone in a big room in Los Angeles for a reading.",
      "\"Bare bones, with no costumes, no nothing, just actors reading,\" Trefry says.",
      "Simon attended this workshop, along with the Duffer brothers, executive producer Shawn Levy and more Netflix representatives.",
      "\"Having these actors in an empty room reading through the script was so energizing,\" Simon tells TODAY.com. \"At the same time, you left feeling, 'This is amazing,' and 'How in the world are they going to bring this to life in a way that delivers on the promise of the spectacle?'\"",
      "Enter: Miriam Buether.",
      "Bringing Another Dimension to Life",
      "While tasked with re-creating the alternate dimension from the show, stage designer Miriam Buether started with the \"real world,\" aiming to design a space that could hold all the special effects Trefry had written.",
      "\"(Trefry) hadn't written for theater before, so she didn't really know what was possible and what wasn't, which sort of gave us a great challenge, but also great possibility,\" Buether tells TODAY.com. \"Because she wrote them in the first place, we then had to find a way to make it work, which was a lot of fun.\"",
      "The \"holding space\" built to contain the engineering feats required for the production became the set for Hawkins High, which Buether designed using reference photos from the filming of Season 5.",
      "The goal was for the set to be able to flip from real to unreal spaces, like the liminal space Buether calls the Black Void, in seconds. In the play, the Black Void is designated by changes in lighting, sound, a body double for McCartney, theatrical fog and more.",
      "Like the TV series, the play is full of jump scares and gasp-worthy moments. In the Black Void, Henry encounters a Demogorgon, and his telekinetic powers permit violent attacks on animals and eventually, people. At one point, the Mind Flayer, a giant shadowy beast that has wormed and twisted its way into Henry's mind, is revealed to the audience.",
      "In London, the Mind Flayer was built into the arch framing the top of the stage, Buether says, but the reveal of the monster \"never felt completely satisfying.\" For Broadway, they had another go at designing the Mind Flayer, using illustrations and models to plan how the puppet could move.",
      "Now, the giant puppet-like figure descends from the top of the stage, out and over the orchestra as its tendrils move above the audience.",
      "\"The first time it really descended ... was quite spectacular, and then video and light and sound brought it to life,\" Buether recalls. \"When it all came together it was quite frightening, actually.\"",
      "Buether, who won the 2025 Tony Award for best scenic design in a play, says she's never worked as closely with a creative team as she did for \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow.\"",
      "\"Theater, of course, is always a collaborative process,\" Buether says. \"But this was more like, unless we all work together and we're all on the same page at any moment, this is actually not going to work.\"",
      "Revelations About the Villain of 'Stranger Things'",
      "\ud83d\udea8Warning: This section contains spoilers for the events of \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow.\u201d",
      "If \"Stranger Things\" Season 4 depicted Henry Creel as a psychopathic child who brutally murdered his family, \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" unpacks all the conditions that led to his acts of violence.",
      "After several self-tapes, workshops and group auditions, McCartney was cast to play Henry when it opened in the West End, and he reprises the role now as it runs on Broadway.",
      "\"I love characters that have a mind,\" McCartney says of Henry. \"Characters who just think right in front of you. Characters who stand for something. Characters who can do something with their role in the story. They're either influential, or they f--- it all up by doing something bad.\"",
      "When he first took on the role, McCartney says he thought Henry was a \"bad kid.\"",
      "\"Now, having done it a year in London and six months here, I really, really feel for the kid,\" he says.",
      "The play reveals that before moving to Hawkins, Henry lived near a military base in Nevada. Shortly after turning 8, Henry went missing for a few hours before he was found in a cave. He likely encountered a doctor involved in testing a survivor of a government initiative, Project Rainbow, which tried to make a ship invisible via electromagnetic energy, but actually transported it to another dimension. That survivor is none other than ship Capt. Brenner, Dr. Brenner's father.",
      "The visit to another dimension changed Capt. Brenner, down to his blood type. It's implied the young Henry encountered something from Capt. Brenner that exposed him to the other dimension.",
      "That explains why Henry is tormented by the Black Void. But it doesn't absolve him of the choices he makes to continue giving into the Void's power, especially as Patty begs him not to.",
      "\u201cHe makes bad decisions, and he likes it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting is that he will do something that will make him feel shame and guilt and fear and regret, and then he has this deep desire to do it again, because he knows deep inside of him that somehow that felt good, and he felt stronger, and he felt more than he was,\u201d McCartney explains.",
      "As he developed his approach to Henry, McCartney says he spoke to the series star Jamie Campbell Bower to understand the mind of the character. \"My goal of that talk was to listen, because he takes spot No. 1,\" he says.",
      "The character is \"malleable,\" McCartney says, constantly changing at the influence of Patty, Dr. Brenner and his parents.",
      "\"It's never just one thing, and that gives me so much every night, and it's just been such a joy to grow with the character,\" he says.",
      "But one constant has been the daunting goal of humanizing a supervillain.",
      "\"We weren't coming at this looking at it like a gimmick. It could easily be a super duper immersive Las Vegas event. You know, 'The Stranger Things Show,'\" McCartney says. \"But we wanted something else out of it. We wanted people to feel for these characters like you do in the TV show. You wanted to see them fight for their f----- lives.\""

      "When \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders\u201d premiered in 2024, the docuseries left some viewers asking how much (or how little) the NFL cheerleaders are paid.",
      "Season 2 of the popular Netflix series, which aired June 18, shows several members of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders stepping up to push for more livable wages.",
      "In light of the success of Season 1, some DCC members were emboldened to start a conversation with management about their pay, explaining their effort to make compensation better for future generations of cheerleaders.",
      "Read on for what \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d reveals of how the DCC are paid.",
      "What Season 1 Showed of DCC\u2019s Salaries",
      "Season 1 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d gave an inside look into what it takes to be an NFL cheerleader, from tryouts to playoffs.",
      "The 36 women who end up on the team appear to spend hours at dance rehearsals, volunteering around Dallas, Texas, and performing at games. At one point in the docuseries, the cheerleaders\u2019 coaching staff said that the dancers typically clock an 11-hour day on game days.",
      "But the show also revealed that most of the women work an additional full-time job, on top of being a Cowboys cheerleader. In their introduction, some of the cheerleaders said they worked jobs as doctors, nurses, accountants, fitness instructors and more.",
      "How Much Do NFL Cheerleaders Make?",
      "In 2024, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d director and executive producer Greg Whiteley told Glamour that he never received a \u201cclean answer\u201d on the cheerleaders\u2019 wages.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because it varies depending on how senior you are in the group. You may even get paid more if you\u2019re a group leader, though that was never clear to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The rates for NFL cheerleaders are not made public, but some reporting, as well as the docuseries, give insights into estimates.",
      "In \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d former Cowboys cheerleader Kat Puryear, who concluded her tenure on the team in 2022, compared their pay to that of \u201ca substitute teacher\u201d or a full-time \u201cChick-fil-A worker.\u201d",
      "In a follow-up video Puryear shared to TikTok in June 2024, she explained that, when she was on the team, the cheerleaders were paid a flat fee for games, in addition to an hourly rate.",
      "For public appearances, cheerleaders were also paid an hourly rate and flat fee, but tenure played a role in that amount, she said in the video. Because many of the women work another job, Puryear said the public appearances were not required. She added that for practices, the athletes are solely compensated an hourly rate.",
      "\u201cSo all in all, it\u2019s a full-time commitment, part-time pay,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "As seen in the docuseries, DCC members also score several perks as part of their roles, including meal prep services, gym memberships, beauty services (tanning, nails, makeup, hair, skincare, etc.), products, dental treatments and more.",
      "NBC Sports Boston reported in 2022 that NFL cheerleaders make, on average, about $150 per game. The athletes were reportedly also making about $50 to $75 for public appearances at the time, which altogether equated to about $22,500 per year.",
      "However, pay differs among teams. The outlet reported that Dallas\u2019 cheerleaders in 2022 were making about $15-20 per hour, which, with game and public appearance fees, totaled to about $75,000 a year.",
      "Per old footage in the Netflix docuseries, the cheerleaders were, at one point, making $15 per game. However, in interviews with former cheerleaders, some said they were \u201csurprised (the Cowboys) paid anything,\u201d calling their job an \u201chonorary position.\u201d",
      "Former cheerleader Tina Kalina, who was on the team in the 1980s, said in the docuseries that she made $35 per game.",
      "\u201cThese millennials, X-Gen, whatever they\u2019re called, they do look at it as a job, whereas us old-timers look at it as more of a privilege,\u201d she said.",

      "In Season 2 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d several members of the DCC have a message for Cowboys\u2019 management: Put your money where your mouth is.",
      "When it comes time to sign contracts for the year, a group consisting of several veteran DCC members unites to push for change.",
      "While some DCC members are hesitant to confront management, saying they \u201ccan see both sides,\u201d others opened up about financial difficulties like being unable to pay rent and \u201cexhaustion\u201d from working multiple jobs.",
      "In the show, the group pushing for change consults with outside legal sources and meets with management, neither of which initially lead to changes. The team considers a walkout to protest the pay, which falls through. Many still debate not turning in their contracts unless changes are made.",
      "In the season finale, however, the athletes receive great news: management has approved a 400% pay increase.",
      "While reflecting on the achievement, DCC Armani Latimer said, \u201cI love the fact that I made change for the girls that are coming up behind me, even if I\u2019m not getting the chance to benefit.\u201d",
      "\u201cDancers are athletes. They have so much value. That\u2019s all I could ever want. So I\u2019m excited to come back,\u201d DCC Megan McElaney added.",
      "What has DCC said about pay?",
      "In regards to the increased salaries revealed at the end of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2, the Cowboys told NBC News in a statement June 18, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased, as you\u2019ll see in the series, that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders were happy with the outcome.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Jones, Cowboys\u2019 chief brand officer and daughter of team owner Jerry Jones, addressed the cheerleaders\u2019 pay in Season 1 of the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders \u2014 and as it should be. They\u2019re not paid a lot,\u201d Jones said in the first season. \u201cBut the facts are that they actually don\u2019t come here for the money. They come here for something that\u2019s actually bigger than that to them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have a passion for dance,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are not a lot of opportunities in the field of dance to get to perform at an elite level. It is about being a part of something bigger than themselves. It is about a sisterhood that they were able to form, about relationships that they have for the rest of their life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, former Cowboys cheerleader Erica Wilkins, who danced from 2014 to 2017, sued the organization for allegedly working over 40 hour weeks, making less than $7.25 per hour. The lawsuit, obtained by TODAY.com, also alleged that the team\u2019s mascot made more than the cheerleaders.",
      "At the time, Wilkins claimed in the lawsuit that she was making $200 per game. During her time on the team, Wilkins also claimed that her gross wages ranged from about $5,800 to $16,500 annually.",
      "Per court documents, Wilkins filed to dismiss the case in July 2018. In 2019, Wilkins\u2019 attorney told WFAA that the matter was resolved.",
      "The Dallas Cowboys declined to comment at the time on cheerleader pay and Wilkins\u2019 lawsuit.",
      "The Cowboys aren\u2019t the only team to face lawsuits from cheerleaders. In 2017, more than 20 organizations with cheerleading teams were named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by a Jane Doe representing cheerleaders across the NFL, NBC News reported. The suit alleged the NFL conspired to keep cheerleader wages as low as possible.",
      "The NFL teams\u2019 motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted in May 2017, per court documents."

    "summary": "Rafael Silva tells TODAY.com about his role in the new Netflix series \"The Waterfront,\" and how he \"deeply connects with his character, Shawn.",
    "story": [
      "Rafael L. Silva got the call that he booked \"The Waterfront\" on a Friday. On Tuesday, he was already filming.",
      "\"What I was understanding from the role itself \u2014\u00a0and it was my first time experiencing this in my young career \u2014 was that, oh, they want me to really just be me,\" he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"The Waterfront\" follows the affluent Buckley family in a fictional North Carolina coastal town as they struggle to keep their fishery business afloat and turn to drug smuggling to make ends meet.",
      "Silva's character, Shawn, is introduced as the new bartender at the family's restaurant. He shares that he's from Galveston, Texas, and in town because he \"wanted a change.\" But his skills \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014\u00a0behind the bar draw suspicion from Buckley matriarch Belle (Maria Bello).",
      "It's revealed in Episode 2 that Shawn was born from an affair between his late mother, Bebe, and head of the Buckley family, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany). Rather than a former bartender, Shawn is actually a law student at the University of Texas at Austin. (Silva, known for starring in the Austin-set \"9-1-1: Lone Star,\" which ended in February 2025, calls this a \"happy coincidence,\" adding, \"Maybe Shawn and Carlos crossed paths, we don't know.\")",
      "Shawn learned the name of his father as his mother died. So, he decided to temporarily leave his life as he knew it, including his boyfriend, to meet his family.",
      "\"Shawn goes the literal distance to learn who his father is, and learning the possibility that he has a father,\" Silva, 31, says. \"I, Rafael,  moved to this country with my mom and my brother to be reunited with my own father. I was 13, and we also went the literal distance for that to happen.\"",
      "Shawn likely never imagined folding into the fiercely loyal Buckley family. By the end, he\u2019s a key member of the group, stepping up to defend Belle when a threat arrives, and  coming up with a plan to save his half-sister Bree Buckley (Melissa Benoist) after she\u2019s kidnapped.",
      "\"The places where Shawn and I may share in our own existence is this blessed ignorance of not knowing what's ahead,\" he adds, \"but knowing that you have to let go of everything that you have in order to find out what you're capable of having or receiving in the future.",
      "\"That's something that I truly connect deeply, because as an immigrant in this country, and especially with the state of the country right now, we didn't come with any one agenda,\" the Brazilian actor says. \"I've never dreamed of being an actor. I never dreamed of living the life that I'm living now.\"",
      "Shawn's goal of finding where he belongs slowly unfolds over the course of the show, against the backdrop of Harlan, Belle, Bree and Cane's (Jake Weary) scheming to keep their business operating and their drug smuggling under the radar.",
      "\"If we go to the core of who I think this character is ... I think there's just this very quiet but thunderous need to not feel alone in life,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva says creator Kevin Williamson, also responsible for \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"The Vampire Diaries,\" essentially \"builds the foundation of a house.\" And Silva was able to add in details of the character from there, imagining key traits and a rich backstory. His key question was: Why is Shawn in Havenport, and why now?",
      "\"I did take my own creative place in justifying Shawn's relationship with his mother, and justifying, like, how come this m---------- can kick some ass, you know?\" he says.",
      "Silva says Shawn came to Havenport because his mother's death marked losing \"the most important person.\" Now, he essentially has nothing to lose.",
      "\"Yes, the romantic partner is important, but (with) family, when it comes to blood, it's irreplaceable,\" he says. \"Blood is irreplaceable when it comes to connection. And I think Shawn is after that.\"",
      "But Shawn\u2019s gradually introduced to the reality of the family\u2019s dealings, which Silva says likely runs counter to his \"strong moral compass\" and respect for the rules as a future lawyer. And by the end, Shawn may have signed up for more than he bargained for. In the explosive finale, Shawn and Cane hatch a plan to rescue Bree, sneaking onto drug supplier Grady's (Topher Grace) boat before a bloody shootout leaves Grady dead.",
      "\"I think Shawn is brokenhearted a little bit by the reality that he's come across who this family,\u00a0who his family, is,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva imagines that his character hoped for a world in which the family he met in Havenport was \"normal\" \u2014\u00a0or at least, not at the helm of a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"He's that compass in the family that is just like, constantly being bombarded with things that makes him want to crawl out of his own skin,\" Silva says. \"I also have questions for Kevin. Who is this guy in the face of all of this? Who has he become? Because at the end of the day, he's still Harlan's son.\""

      "She then suggests a marinade to take those jammy eggs to the next level: Soak them in soy sauce, tamarind, rice vinegar, chili, ginger and \u201cmaybe a little bit of garlic\u201d overnight.",
      "\u201cYou wake up in the morning, crack it open over some rice,\u201d Palmer says \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s a jammy egg for your a--. It\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet her cook!\u201d she adds, and after copious amounts of laughter, Evans asks if she can actually cook.",
      "\u201cI mean, I can cook a mean jammy egg,\u201d she says, before thinking for a moment. \u201cI can cook great breakfast. Great with a pancake, great with eggs, bacon, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "On TikTok, the hashtag #jammyegg holds hundreds of videos, and that might be where the \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d star has been watching them. People have also taken to using her instructions as a sound on the platform.",
      "Thanks to Palmer, older jammy egg-focused videos are getting more play: On a TikTok from September 2021, in which a user shows how to make a jammy egg in an air fryer, the top comment mentions the star by name.",

      "A second former senior DOJ official expressed concern about the division\u2019s ability to thwart retaliatory attacks from Iran.",
      "\u201cThe US and Israeli strikes on Iran have heightened the risk of Iranian retaliation in the homeland and a lone wolf violent extremist attack,\u201d the former official said by text. \u201cThe National Security Division was created to ensure there are DOJ prosecutors with nationwide visibility into the threat landscape at times like this, and its work has never been more important.\u201d",
      "After President Donald Trump took office in January, several top DOJ and FBI national security officials who participated in the criminal investigations into Trump or the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters were removed from their jobs and, in some cases, reassigned to immigration enforcement, according to current and former DOJ and FBI officials. Four of the top officials ousted from the National Security Division had close to 100 years of experience between them, former officials said.",
      "David Laufman, former head of the National Security Division\u2019s counterintelligence and export control section, expressed similar concerns.",
      "\u201cIn the aftermath of the U.S. military strikes in Iran, the FBI will need to maximize counterterrorism resources to prevent and disrupt anything the Iranians might attempt within the United States,\u201d Laufman said through text. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the recent personnel turmoil at the Bureau doesn\u2019t adversely impact that effort.\u201d",
      "DOJ and FBI spokespersons said the agencies\u2019 counterterrorism efforts remain strong.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman said that the National Security Division, or NSD, has been investigating and prosecuting foreign and domestic terrorism cases, citing recent work on the Minnesota shooting of two state lawmakers and the attack on a fertility center in Palm Springs, California.",
      "\u201cThe National Security Division is staffed with dedicated and talented personnel who continue to provide significant support to a wide range of important cases in order to make America safe again,\u201d Chad Gilmartin said in an emailed statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is a fiction generated by those who have no insight into the Division\u2019s day-to-day work.\u201d",
      "The FBI affirmed its commitment to counterterrorism.",
      "\u201cThe FBI continuously analyzes the threat landscape and allocates resources and personnel in alignment with that analysis and the investigative needs of the Bureau,\u201d the FBI spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe make adjustments and changes based on many factors and remain flexible as various needs arise. The FBI\u2019s role in and dedication to investigating terrorism, both domestically and internationally, has not changed.\u201d",
      "Concerns in the FBI",
      "But a former senior FBI official said a loss of counterterrorism resources made the bureau less prepared to respond to potential retaliation from Iran.",
      "In a text message, he said the diversion of bureau resources to focus on illegal immigration and the loss of national security experts \u201creduces the bureau\u2019s effectiveness at a time when Iran is doubly incentivized to attack us.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes bureau leaders will now devote additional resources to the threat posed by Iran. \u201cThe Bureau surges like no other agency can,\u201d he added.",
      "Two former FBI officials said high-level ousters and resignations at lower levels are rampant within the counterterrorism division.",
      "\u201cThere are people leaving left and right,\u201d said the former senior FBI official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThere is a brain drain at the executive level.\u201d",
      "Robert Wells, the head of the the FBI's national security branch, was forced out soon after Trump took office in January, according to current and former FBI officials. David Scott, who served as the bureau's counterterrorism chief, left the bureau in May, according to his LinkedIn profile and two former FBI officials.",
      "Some FBI agents have been diverted to less critical tasks, such as the redacting of FBI records related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to one former FBI official.",
      "Officials in the first Trump administration ruled that Epstein\u2019s death in 2019 was a suicide, but it has remained the subject of conspiracy theories suggesting he was murdered because of his connections to high-profile celebrities and politicians.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are looking to leave because of the environment,\u201d a second former FBI official said through text, referring to departures across the bureau. \u201cThere is a huge void in leadership and experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just going back in time and settling old scores,\u201d said the first former senior FBI official. \u201cIt\u2019s not the FBI I knew.\u201d",
      "Emerging threats",
      "The six former DOJ and FBI officials warned of rapidly evolving foreign and domestic terror threats, from potential retaliatory attacks by Iran to lone-wolf assassinations like the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota.",
      "In these crimes, the attackers act alone and often undergo a rapid radicalization without engaging in behavior that puts them on the radar of law enforcement.",
      "One of the former FBI officials expressed frustration over what they see as a misplaced focus within the FBI, saying issues like China, Russia and cyberthreats are being neglected.",
      "One of the former DOJ officials noted that 25 prosecutors were added to the NSD\u2019s counterintelligence section to address espionage by China, Russia, Iran and other rivals, as well as Russian sanctions evasion after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. He called the recent reduction in staffing \u201cvery concerning.\u201d",
      "Laufman, the former head of the counterintelligence and export control section, agreed.",
      "\u201cLosing a magnitude of experience to address terrorism and counterintelligence threats, both in leadership ranks and line personnel, puts America at greater risk,\u201d Laufman said.",
      "The Justice Department spokesman noted that John Eisenberg, the new head of the National Security Division, was recently confirmed by the Senate and is beginning to hire and expand his team. He said that the NSD\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Unit \u2014 which was created by the Biden administration to focus on domestic threats \u2014 had not been reduced in size or reorganized.",
      "The DOJ spokesperson also said there is sometimes an overlap between counterterrorism and immigration cases, citing the example of foreign terrorist organizations trying to operate in the U.S.",
      "\u201cCounterterrorism employees work collaboratively, and the cases are generally not neatly compartmentalized or segmented,\u201d he said.",
      "An early demotion",
      "One of the former DOJ officials said that Attorney General Pam Bondi, who oversees both the DOJ and FBI, signaled the administration\u2019s priorities days after she took office.",
      "On Feb. 12, Bondi appeared in the hallway outside their offices, holding three large, framed portraits of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and former Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding to know why they were still hanging on the division\u2019s walls.",
      "The acting head of the division, an appointee of the first Trump administration who worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office, said the portraits could be removed only by building maintenance staff. Officials from previous administrations had also sometimes found portraits of their predecessors hanging on the department\u2019s walls.",
      "Bondi then criticized division officials in two Fox News interviews, suggesting the staff was disloyal to Trump. The acting head of the division was demoted shortly afterward, according to three former DOJ officials.",
      "What was most concerning, a former DOJ official said, was the demotion of the former Trump appointee, an experienced lawyer trusted by both Trump administration officials and career DOJ lawyers.",
      "The demotion was short-sighted, said the former DOJ official, \u201cand that\u2019s bad for national security.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to order strikes in Iran \u2014 among the most consequential he has made as commander in chief \u2014 is the latest example of a U.S. president\u2019s taking military action without first seeking congressional approval. And experts say that, while his power over American armed forces isn\u2019t absolute, there\u2019s most likely little lawmakers will do.",
      "Trump is supposed to submit to Congress a legal justification for having bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities within 48 hours after the operation began. Unlike tangible consequences Trump has faced for other moves in which he tested the bounds of executive power \u2014 such as court rulings against him \u2014 any price he might pay for this decision would largely play out in the American political arena and on the world stage, where the U.S. reputation is on the line.",
      "\u201cPresidents over the last 25 years have certainly been stretching the envelope of presidential authority to use force,\u201d John Bellinger, adjunct senior fellow for international and national security law at the Council on Foreign Relations, told NBC News. \u201cUsing force more and more, deploying the military more and more, without congressional authority \u2014 and Congress, with a few persistent objectors, has simply acquiesced in that.\u201d",
      "The limits on presidential power to use military force are set out in sections of the U.S. Constitution, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the United Nations Charter.",
      "Article 1 of the Constitution makes it clear: Congress \u2014 and no other part of the federal government \u2014 has the power to declare war. But that\u2019s something Congress hasn\u2019t formally done in more than 80 years, since World War II.",
      "While Congress has approved what are called Authorizations of Military Force and appropriated funds to assist in ongoing conflicts, its ability to control when the nation is at war has been diminished, in part by its own actions, while the power of the office of the president has expanded.",
      "The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a law designed to provide a check on the president\u2019s power to involve the United States in military action without the consent of Congress. It was passed over President Richard Nixon\u2019s veto in the wake of the Vietnam War, which Congress never actually declared as a war, though it did authorize force in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.",
      "According to the War Powers Resolution, \u201cin any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced\u201d when war hasn\u2019t been declared, the president has 48 hours to notify, in writing, the speaker of the House and the Senate president pro tempore. The act requires that the notification include why the president took the action, the authority under which it was taken and \u201cthe estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement.\u201d And the resolution also says any time a president uses the armed forces without notifying Congress beforehand, that use must be terminated within 60 days.",
      "Bellinger said any notification to Congress that Trump sends, which Bellinger told NBC News the Justice Department is likely to prepare, will probably rely on the authority granted to the president in Article II of the Constitution, which makes the president the commander in chief. President Joe Biden cited Article II in 2021 after he ordered strikes in Iraq and Syria that he said were targeting an \u201cIranian-backed militia group responsible for recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.\u201d",
      "Presidents testing limits",
      "Though Congress acted after the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam to restrain presidents in their use of military force, recent decades have seen presidents push against those restraints.",
      "On March 23, 1999, the Senate approved NATO airstrikes against what was then Yugoslavia to force a Serbian withdrawal from the province of Kosovo. But when the strikes began 24 hours later, the House had yet to approve the resolution, and a month later, in a tie vote, it rejected the Senate resolution amid increased concerns of greater U.S. military involvement in the area.",
      "In March 2011, a coalition of NATO forces, which included the United States, began a military campaign to intervene in the Libyan civil war to protect civilians. While President Barack Obama ordered it, he didn\u2019t seek advance approval from Congress. By June, the House had passed a resolution calling for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region and demanded that the Obama administration explain why it didn\u2019t ask Congress for permission first.",
      "In April 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term, he didn\u2019t seek congressional authorization before he ordered a missile strike in Syria in response to the Syrian government\u2019s use of chemical weapons. \u201cIt is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,\u201d he said in televised remarks after the strikes.",
      "Bellinger, who helped draft Authorizations for Military Force under President George W. Bush, said it isn\u2019t always that way. On Jan. 12, 1991, the Senate voted in favor of a resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in response to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, after President George H.W. Bush asked it to do so. In September 2001 and again in October 2002, President George W. Bush asked Congress to authorize the use of armed force, first in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and then to target Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi government.",
      "\u201cTo strike a country like Iran, I think this does go far beyond what other presidents have done,\u201d Bellinger said.",
      "Congress, however, may not have the appetite to fight Trump over it.",
      "\u201cGiven that a lot of people in Congress tend not to want to buck the president or obviously some of them agree with his actions anyway,\u201d Curtis Bradley, a professor at University of Chicago Law School, said in an interview, \u201cit seems unlikely at the moment that Congress would, you know, use its statutory powers to try to end or restrict the conflict.\u201d",
      "U.S. courts are also unlikely to get involved. The judicial branch has limited authority over a president when it comes to his decisions about military action and the use of force.",
      "\u201cThe lower courts, when they get these cases, tend to say, sorry, this is very complicated,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThey say it\u2019s really to be resolved by the political institutions and not the courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if it is unconstitutional, I don\u2019t see it\u2019s likely that courts will be the ones to police that,\u201d he added.",
      "The U.N.",
      "International law, including the U.N. Charter, lays out very clearly what is and isn\u2019t justified when a country decides to use force.",
      "Article II of the U.N. Charter orders \u201call members\u201d to settle their international disputes \u201cby peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.\u201d",
      "While a separate section of the U.N. Charter allows for military action to be taken in self-defense, experts say, that argument will be harder for the Trump administration to make in this scenario.",
      "\u201cThe idea that you could just ... attack because, in the long run, you think your strategic interests will be harmed does not fit with the charter under anybody\u2019s reasonable definition of self-defense,\u201d Bradley said.",
      "But what does a violation of the U.N. Charter mean? Not much, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time, unfortunately, where the U.S. is doing something that probably violates the charter,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThat ends up being more about diplomacy, rather than something that would directly stop a president from acting.\u201d",
      "Bellinger believes that even without any direct domestic or international legal consequences, the implications of Trump\u2019s decisions are wide-ranging. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a political cost at home, and it\u2019s going to be more of a reputational cost for the United States around the world.\u201d"

      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Several lawmakers said Sunday that they will press the Trump administration for clarity about the attack on Iran and the endgame he envisions. But they are also using the moment to try to undercut Trump's standing with those who voted for him in the hope he would not get entangled in foreign wars.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said Trump's commitment was \"to get us out of foreign wars.\"",
      "\"Say what you want about Joe Biden, Joe Biden didn\u2019t start any wars,\" Smith said. \"He got us out of the one war that we were in [in Afghanistan]. Trump has now started a war with Iran.\u201d",
      "Justifying the strike, Trump administration officials said the United States has crippled an Iranian nuclear program that poses a worldwide threat.",
      "But the attack could also invite retaliatory strikes against U.S. service members and assets in the region and perhaps even the homeland.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that while he hopes for the best after the attacks, \u201chistory suggests that you better be well aware of the fact that the best-case scenario almost never happens.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that the Iranians have a lot more missiles than we think they do and we end up with dead soldiers and sailors in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Before Trump ordered the strike, Iran had sent a private message warning him that the regime could unleash terrorist attacks in the United States by activating sleeper cells inside the country, according to two U.S. officials and a person with knowledge of the threat.",
      "What's more, Trump\u2019s State Department put out a warning to Americans worldwide Sunday that they face heightened risk due to the Iranian conflict.",

      "A handful of Democrats have voiced support for the strikes, including Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, as well as Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada.",
      "Whether Trump sees the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities as a one-off or a precursor to deeper U.S. involvement is unclear. He and his senior officials put out conflicting messages Sunday about Iran\u2019s fate.",
      "After Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance said they had no interest in ousting Iran\u2019s leadership in favor of a more palatable regime, Trump suggested that his goal may be more far-reaching. He wrote on social media that he might want to see new leadership in Iran and floated potential \"regime change.\"",
      "\u201cMake Iran Great Again,\u201d he wrote in a twist on his old campaign slogan.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: \u201cThere needs to be a classified briefing of Congress and a public explanation to the American people about the strategy for protecting American troops and personnel, as well as seeking peace and stability in the region.",

      "\u201cThe war between Russia and Ukraine is Biden\u2019s war, not mine. I just got here and for four years during my term had no problem in preventing it from happening,\u201d Trump said in April. \"President Putin and everyone else respected your president!\u201d",

      "Clayton Seigle, senior fellow for Energy Security and Climate Change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that as China is \u201cvery dependent\u201d on oil flows from the Gulf, not just Iran, \u201cits national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait.\u201d",
      "There are currently no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing through the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center. \u201cU.S. associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption, which is a positive sign for the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Impact of potential disruptions",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and about 20% of the world\u2019s oil transits the waterway. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the \u201cworld\u2019s most important oil transit chokepoint.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s operations in and around Hormuz are unlikely to be \u2018all or nothing\u2019 \u2014 but instead move along a sliding scale from total disruption to none at all,\u201d said Signum\u2019s Bishop.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy [for Iran] would be to rattle Hormuz oil flows just enough to hurt the U.S. via moderate upward price movement, but not enough to provoke a major U.S. response against Iran\u2019s oil production and export capacity,\u201d he added.",
      "On Sunday, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a post on X that pump prices in the U.S. could climb to $3.35-$3.50 per gallon in the days ahead, compared with the national average of $3.139 for the week of June 16.",
      "Should Iran decide to close the strait, it would most likely use small boats for a partial blockade, or for a more complete solution, mine the waterway, according to David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy.",
      "In a Sunday note, S&P Global Commodity Insights wrote that any Iranian closure of the strait would affect not only Iran\u2019s own exports, but also those of nearby Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "That would potentially remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, and affect regional refineries by causing feedstock shortages, the research firm said. The disruption to supply would impact Asia and Europe as well as North America.",
      "Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be \u201cseverely impacted,\u201d S&P said, with Qatar\u2019s gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe.",
      "Qatar\u2019s LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.",
      "\u201cAlternative supply routes for Middle Eastern oil and gas are limited, with pipeline capacity insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,\u201d S&P added.",
      "The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pointed out that \u201cthere is limited scope to bypass the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d Pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have only a spare capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day between them, while the strait oversees the transport of an estimated 20 million barrels of oil and oil products per day, the bank said in a note.",
      "All these present upside risk to energy prices, with Goldman Sachs estimating that the market is pricing in a geopolitical risk premium of $12.",
      "If oil flows through the strait were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down by 10% for another 11 months, Brent is forecast to \u201cbriefly jump\u201d to a peak of around $110, Goldman said.",
      "Brent oil futures currently stand at $78.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures were trading at $75.75."

      "ERBIL, Iraq \u2014 Hailing the American strikes on Iran as a success, President Donald Trump said late Saturday that the Islamic Republic\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d",
      "But despite his bullish claims, the extent of the damage to the deeply buried facility at Fordo, as well as sites at Isfahan and Natanz, is unclear and almost 400 kilograms, or 880 pounds, of uranium enriched to 60% are publicly unaccounted for. Power plants require the radioactive metal to be enriched to only 3%-5%, whereas 90% is required to build a nuclear warhead.",
      "Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said damage was visible at the Fordo and Natanz sites after American B-2 Spirit bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator munitions known as \u201cbunker busters\u201d on them and U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles hit infrastructure targets at Isfahan.",
      "\u201cCraters are visible at the Fordo site, Iran\u2019s main location for enriching uranium to 60%,\u201d Grossi said. He added that \u201centrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit\u201d at Isfahan, as had buildings \u201crelated to the uranium conversion process.\u201d At Natanz, he said, the fuel enrichment plant had \u201cbeen hit again.\u201d",
      "But he said that \u201cno one\u201d including his International Atomic Energy Agency, was \u201cin a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo,\u201d and he called for inspectors to be allowed back \u201cto Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Israel appear confident they know the location of the highly enriched uranium. Speaking to CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d before Grossi made his assessment, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he doubted Iran had been able to move the enriched the uranium and that \u201cwe have to assume that there\u2019s a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan.\u201d"

      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""
