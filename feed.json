      "A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England last summer is going on trial",
      "LONDON -- It was the first day of summer vacation and the little girls at the Hart Space, a sanctuary hidden behind a row of houses, were there to dance to the music of Taylor Swift.",
      "What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when an intruder with a knife attacked the girls and their teacher on July 29 in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "The teen arrested in the aftermath goes on trial Monday on three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaida manual.",
      "The trial is expected to last four weeks.",
      "Axel Rudakubana, 18, who has refused to speak in court, had pleas of not guilty entered on his behalf at Liverpool Crown Court. He was 17 at the time of the attack.",
      "Prosecutors haven't said what they believe led to the rampage.",
      "The stabbings led to a week of rioting across parts of England and Northern Ireland after Rudakubana \u2014 then unnamed \u2014 was falsely identified as an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat.",
      "Violent groups made up mostly of men who were mobilized by far-right activists on social media attacked mosques and hotels housing migrants, tossed beer bottles, rocks and other weapons at police, and set fire to cars as they clashed with officers in dozens of cities.",
      "More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison.",
      "Rudakubana, who was born in Wales to Rwandan immigrants, is charged with murder in the deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6.",
      "Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and Jonathan Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened. Fifteen other girls, as young as 5, were at the class but uninjured.",
      "Several months after his arrest on the day of the killings, Rudakubana was charged with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer.",
      "Police have said the stabbings haven't been classified as acts of terrorism because the motive isn't yet known."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 02:42:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc&eacute; or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
    "story": [
      "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in, which stood in stark contrast to someone like Barack Obama, whose second inaugural ceremony had performances from Beyonc\u00e9, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson and a series of starry onlookers.",
      "There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump\u2019s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.",
      "Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.",
      "\u201cThe people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.\u201d",
      "Even some who have publicly criticized Trump in the past seem to have changed course. One of the highest-profile examples is the rapper Snoop Dogg, who in a 2017 music video pretended to shoot a Trump lookalike, and then this weekend performed at a pre-Inaugural event called The Crypto Ball. When a social media user posted a video of his performance, his name quickly became a trending topic on social media with a fair amount of disbelief and outrage.",
      "There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification for their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.",
      "Also, Thompson said, \u201cthe idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.\u201d",
      "The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone\u2019s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood\u2019s songs from their playlists.",
      "Where Trump once emphasized the otherness of a Hollywood that largely shunned him, he\u2019s now turned his attention back to the entertainment capital as a project to be saved. He named Stallone, Voight and Mel Gibson as his chosen \u201cambassadors\u201d for the mission. Thompson said it sounds like an Onion headline or something on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d That, or a logline for the latest installment in the \u201cExpendables\u201d franchise.",
      "Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017, when nationwide marches brought out the likes of Cher, Madonna, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys and Janelle Monae. The People\u2019s March in D.C. on Saturday did not boast about any celebrity participants. At the Golden Globe Awards in early January, Trump\u2019s name was not mentioned on stage -\u2013 a stark contrast to 2017, when Meryl Streep used her lifetime achievement award speech to decry the president-elect before his first term began.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gone through these processes, and it turned out that none of it ever made any bit of difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll of this celebrity talking against Trump and all of the celebrities going for (Joe) Biden and speaking about the future of democracy not only didn\u2019t make any difference toward the outcome of the election, but one could argue that it actually meant that things moved in the other direction.\u201d",
      "On Friday night in D.C., the nonpartisan nonprofit The Creative Coalition brought together some actors to raise money for and celebrate organizations that support military service members and their families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of things that are nonpartisan, nonpolitical,\u201d said comedian Jeff Ross. \u201cI talk smack for a living and I\u2019m a big believer in free speech. The military protects my right.\u201d",
      "The entertainers stayed largely focused on the event at hand, not the incoming administration, although they did express concern about funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.",
      "\u201cThe NEA has always been in peril, regardless of what administration comes in. But it feels like the incoming administration will probably be more aggressive in cutting down funding for the arts,\u201d said actor Steven Weber. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s an essential component not only in our education, but in the life blood of this culture.\u201d",
      "One Monday event will have a bit of celebrity counterprogramming \u2014 the Concert for America, not as protest but as fundraiser for wildfire relief which will be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles and livestreamed to the world. Participants include Jon Cryer, Lisa Joyner, Conan O\u2019Brien, Julie Bowen, Adam Scott, Wayne Brady and Rosie Perez. In addition to performances and comedy, it will also highlight organizations dedicated to protecting human rights.",
      "Producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson started the event in 2017, also held on Inauguration Day, to raise money for organizations and non-profits they thought would need help over the next four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only to give people a call to action, but also to give them hope, inspiration and to feel connected,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "They didn\u2019t have trouble recruiting entertainers to participate, Jackson said. The only ones who declined did so because they were working.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a counter effort,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cI see it as a way to get rid of the annoying rhetoric and the hate that\u2019s based on nothing. It\u2019s about unity.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park",
      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky is at a crossroads. He could soar to new heights of celebrity in 2025, or be brought back to earth quickly by a trial starting Tuesday that could led to his imprisonment for years.",
      "The hip-hop star, and longtime partner to Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons, is set to touch the highest levels of high fashion as one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May along with Pharrell Williams, LeBron James and others.",
      "And his modest acting career will get a major boost from starring alongside Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\" planned for a summer release.",
      "But at the Los Angeles trial that's expected to last about three weeks, he is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He's accused of firing on a former friend on the streets near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. If convicted, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The 36-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney says he committed no crime.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said after a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s waiting over Rocky\u2019s head and Rihanna and their family\u2019s heads for a while. We\u2019re anxious to get this thing underway and get this behind him.\u201d",
      "The trial has its roots in high school in New York, when the Harlem-raised Rakim Mayers, now known as A$AP Rocky, met Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, who will be the trial's most important witness.",
      "Ephron testified at a 2023 preliminary hearing that he brought Rocky into a crew of young creators who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for \u201cAlways Strive and Prosper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had dreams, pretty much,\u201d Ephron said.",
      "He testified that the members remained close even as Rocky became rich and famous, but the relationships would eventually erode.",
      "The feud came to a head in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, when according to Ephron, Rocky fired at him three or four times, the shots grazing his knuckles.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later, and brought shell casings he had picked up himself \u2014 both points the defense will seize on.",
      "\u201cYou need nothing more than Mr. Ephron\u2019s testimony by itself,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec, the case's lead prosecutor, told a judge at the 2023 hearing,",
      "The trial is full of large personalities, along with two huge names that will loom over the proceedings despite having no direct role: President-elect Donald Trump and Rihanna.",
      "The trial begins the day after the second inauguration of Trump, whom Tacopina represented in the defamation and sexual abuse lawsuit of writer E. Jean Carroll. And Rocky himself became an unlikely cause celebre for then-President Trump during his first term when Trump publicly declared he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was jailed after a brawl in Sweden in 2019.",
      "But Trump has no power over these proceedings, and could not pardon Rocky if he's convicted.",
      "Those anticipating the trial have long been asking whether Rihanna may attend.",
      "\u201cThe mother of his children is she going to be here?\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold asked the defense at an October hearing. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to be here whenever she wants I\u2019d just like to know.\u201d",
      "Tacopina has been unable to give a definitive answer, but has said that he does not expect it.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Rihanna and doesn\u2019t want her anywhere near this proceeding,\" he said after Wednesday's hearing. \"But that\u2019s a family decision they\u2019ll make.\u201d",
      "Tacopina said he has no intention of bringing Rihanna's name up at trial, but Arnold suggested he may when screening jurors.",
      "The judge, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, has an affable but no-nonsense style and dispenses with many court formalities. He said he will keep the juror selection process simple, and a jury should be seated quickly.",
      "In an uncommon move in LA County courts, he will allow cameras in court for nearly the entire trial.",
      "\u201cI believe that the public deserves to see what goes on in the courtroom,\u201d he said.",
      "Tacopina has also represented other hip-hop figures, including Meek Mill and YG. The lawyer who normally practices in New York is gregarious, quick with a joke and always happy to talk to the media, but can be ruthless in cross-examination.",
      "When discussing Ephron's minor injuries at the 2023 hearing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he survived that shooting\u201d and was admonished for his tone.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate scion Robert Durst, was a late addition to the prosecution team. He's also known for his aggressive cross-examination, including a relentless, weeks-long questioning of Durst.",
      "The case against Rocky will largely depend on how credible the jurors find Ephron.",
      "Police officers who searched the Hollywood sidewalk after a report of shots fired found no shell casings. Police recovered no fingerprints from the 9 mm casings Ephron brought them, and no 9 mm pistol was found when a search warrant was served on Rocky.",
      "Surveillance video captured parts of the incident. Prosecutors at the 2023 hearing showed a video still with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Tacopina said he has not decided whether Rocky will testify, which he is legally allowed to avoid.",
      "\u201cHe is eager to tell his story, he would love the opportunity to do so,\u201d the lawyer said Wednesday. \u201cHe is very articulate and very intelligent, he\u2019s a good human being, that would come out if he testifies, but that decision has not been made yet.

      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",

      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",

      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",

      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.",
      "All around the room is a buzzing clutter of period analog equipment. The video monitors act like windows, offering perspectives of the drama just outside: the taking of Israeli Olympic team members by the Palestinian militant group Black September.",
      "Inside the control room are the sports producers who were thrown into covering one of the first breaking news events televised worldwide. Some 900 million viewers are estimated to have watched.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a taut procedural recently nominated for best film, drama, by the Golden Globes, suggests this was a seminal moment in media history. Inside the control room, a handful of producers reckon in real time with questions that still pervade today\u2019s journalism: What\u2019s appropriate to show? Are we informing or sensationalizing? Do we have our facts straight?",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing",
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",

      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department says Alabama is unnecessarily institutionalizing children with physical disabilities in nursing homes and hospitals",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama children with physical disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday, warning it would file suit against the state unless changes are made to allow more of these children to live at home.",
      "A Justice Department investigation found Alabama is violating the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act to administer services to individuals with disabilities in the setting most appropriate to the person\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cMany children with physical disabilities in Alabama are unnecessarily institutionalized or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote to state officials.",
      "Clarke announced the probe's findings in a letter to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama Department of Senior Services. It listed changes the state should make to provide more community services and threatened a federal lawsuit if action isn't taken.",
      "Alabama\u2019s Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s office referred questions to the state agencies. The Department of Human Resources did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.",
      "The federal investigation found that Alabama policies effectively limit community-based services, or long-term support services, which allow children with physical disabilities to live at home.",
      "Federal officials said the state has not adequately developed its community-based workforce. The Justice Department also said Alabama fails to support foster parents who care for, or are considering caring for, children with physical disabilities.",

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",

Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",

      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs.

      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "She hears a sound that breaks her focus. Was that a cough? Will her mask protect her?",
      "COVID-19 remains a very present threat for the 55-year-old. Scarbro has multiple immune disorders, making her vulnerable to infection.",
      "\u201cAny minute anybody could cough, just incidentally,\u201d said Scarbro, who lives in Sunset Beach, North Carolina. \u201cAnd that cough could be the one thing that could make me sick.\u201d",
      "This month marks the fifth anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. The virus would go on to kill 1.2 million Americans and disrupt countless lives.",
      "While the pandemic's emergency phase ended in May 2023, the threat of infection remains a governing force in the lives of people like Scarbro. They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",
      "In online support groups, they trade research about the danger of repeat infections and cognitive impairment. They miss the empathy they felt during the early days of the pandemic. Some have lost friendships, but they strive to maintain the social ties that are important to mental health.",
      "Scarbro\u2019s bowling league helps her feel connected to her neighbors. But recently, she\u2019s detected more stares and skeptical looks from strangers when she bowls in a mask.",
      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both. But immunocompromised people like Scarbro, who has common variable immune deficiency, must be constantly vigilant. Unlike the flu, COVID has not settled into a seasonal pattern.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a time when they can relax a little bit,\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging and exhausting thing to ask someone to do.\u201d",
      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",
      "Denver-based sisters Jacqueline and Alexa Child stay masked while going to concerts and dining outdoors with friends who don\u2019t share the same level of COVID-19 caution.",
      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world is able to kind of go back to their regular lives, our community doesn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d she said.",
      "Scarbro, her husband and children are constantly taking into account other people\u2019s COVID-19 safety practices.",
      "And as the world turns back to pre-COVID life, Scarbro's family is doing what they can to keep her healthy \u2014 but not in complete isolation.",
      "\u201cI feel very scared about the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that people are done, and I respect that, but it\u2019s only going to make it harder for me and my family to keep me safe.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency Monday after the country reported its second case of mpox in less than four days, health authorities said.",
      "Neither case had known recent contact with infected animals or other sick individuals, the health ministry said. Only the first case involved recent travel, limited to the airport town of Lungi in the northern Port Loko District between Dec. 26 and Jan. 6th. Both patients are receiving treatment at a hospital in the capital, Freetown.",
      "Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a \u201cpox-like\u201d disease in monkeys occurred. Until recently, most human cases were seen in people in central and West Africa who had close contact with infected animals.",
      "In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox. The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year.",
      "Sierra Leone was previously the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in West Africa, affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",

      "NEW DELHI -- An Indian court on Monday sentenced a police volunteer to life in prison after finding him guilty in the rape and killing of a trainee doctor last year, a crime that sparked nationwide protests over inadequate safety for women and led to a speedy trial in the country\u2019s slow-moving justice system.",
      "Sanjay Roy, 33, who has consistently maintained his innocence, can appeal the judgment in a higher court.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital\u2019s seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
      "Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime.",
      "The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim.",
      "Roy was arrested a day after the crime, and arguments in the case began in November. The assault prompted India\u2019s Supreme Court to set up a national task force to suggest ways to enhance safety in government hospitals.",
      "Many crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women\u2019s rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where communities sometimes shame victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. Four men sentenced to death for the 2012 crime were hanged in 2020.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.",
      "Activists say new sentencing requirements haven\u2019t deterred rapes and the number of recorded rape cases has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.",

      "The Houthis' announcement, made in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday, likely won't be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that's crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.",
      "The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision.",
      "The Houthis made the announcement through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, saying it was \u201cstopping sanctions\u201d on the other vessels it has previously targeted since November 2023.",
      "However, it left open resuming attacks against both the United States and the United Kingdom, which have launched airstrikes targeting the rebels over their seaborne assaults.",
      "\u201cIn the event of any aggression ... the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state,\u201d the center said. \"You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.\"",
      "The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",

There he caught the eye of senior leaders and was elevated to district-level governance before becoming the city's mayor and then party secretary, the city's highest position, following a financial scandal involving his predecessor. Xi had briefly held the position after the scandal, giving Han access to him before him became China's new leader.",
      "In 2017, Han reached the apex of Chinese political power, the party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and after serving one five-year term was given the position of vice president, a position Xi has imbued with new weight as adviser and envoy.",

It is the first large-scale operation in the area in recent years.",
      "The latest attack in Kurram, in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was on Friday when unidentified gunmen ambushed and burned aid trucks, killing two security personnel and at least five drivers.",
      "The district has been cut off from the rest of the country since November after authorities blocked roads following clashes between heavily armed Shiite and Sunni tribes. At the time, gunmen ambushed a convoy of vehicles carrying passengers, killing 52 people, mostly Shiites. Retaliatory attacks left over 70 others dead.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of residents have since faced a shortage of food and medicine with aid organizations unable to enter the area.",
      "Barrister Saif Ali, a spokesman for the provincial government, said the operation became \u201cinevitable\u201d following the surge in violence. He also said authorities are moving some residents to temporary governmental shelter camps while the operation is ongoing in several areas, including the city of Bagan from where most of the violence has been reported.",
      "Motasim Billah, a government administrator, said the goal of the operation is to fully restore peace and ensure the writ of the government.",
      "Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant Sunni groups previously targeting minority Shiites.",

    "story": [
      "Poland\u2019s presidency of the European Union is firmly focused on security",
      "POLOWCE, Poland -- Poland's six-month presidency of the European Union is firmly focused on security. As Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades rages, fewer places highlight the challenges and contradictions of defending the bloc and its values more starkly than the border with Belarus.",
      "Some 13,000 border guards and soldiers protect around 400 kilometers (250 miles) of border. It\u2019s become a buffer zone since Belarus\u2019 ally, Russia, invaded neighboring Ukraine three years ago. Similar fortifications farther north line Poland's frontier with the Russian region of Kaliningrad.",
      "Poland is Ukraine\u2019s top logistical backer. Most of the Western-supplied arms, ammunition and equipment helping to keep Ukraine\u2019s armed forces afloat transit through. Russia, meanwhile, uses Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion.",
      "At the border near the town of Po\u0142owce, a 5.5-meter (18-foot) steel barrier strung with razor wire and topped by security cameras separates once-friendly communities that war has turned into wary rivals. Drones, helicopters and armored vehicles keep watch.",
      "The border crossing is closed. Around 40 border guards and troops could be seen on Jan. 16, when the Polish EU presidency invited 60 reporters from international media to witness the security effort.",
      "The road was strewn with layers of concrete obstacles and concertina wire likely to dissuade an advancing army. Border guards peered into Belarus.",
      "It\u2019s needed, the government in Warsaw says, because Russia and Belarus are waging a particular kind of hybrid warfare: helping groups of migrants \u2014 mostly from Africa or the Middle East \u2014 to break through the border to provoke and destabilize Poland and the rest of Europe.",
      "\u201cWe have tightened our visa policy, and above all we have decided to suspend the right to asylum wherever we are dealing with mass border crossings organized by Belarus and Russia,\u201d Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Friday.",
      "Almost 30,000 attempted border crossings were spotted last year. Most are young men, often from Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Polish authorities say they arrive in Belarus on tourist or student visas and are helped across for a fee ranging from $8,000 to $12,000.",
      "Poland says they\u2019re assisted by the Belarus security services and other \u201corganizers.\u201d They're mostly Ukrainians, perhaps fallen on hard times since fleeing the war. They can earn $500 for each person they help, border officials say.",
      "Border guards claim to be routinely attacked. One guard was killed last year and several injured.",
      "They say that migrants shoot slingshots, throw small explosives or rocks, or use pepper spray on guards. More than 400 incidents were recorded last year in this section of the border, with 307 people hospitalized.",
      "The deputy commander of the Podlaski border guard division, Col. Andrzej Stasiulewicz, said the migrants are hard to discourage. \u201cWarning shots don\u2019t work, so force is needed,\u201d he said. Reporters were shown video and photos purported to show migrants assailing the border.",
      "Stasiulewicz said their actions are \u201cvery unpredictable, and very precise and coordinated.\u201d",
      "Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders paints a different picture. The charity says it's treated more than 400 people since November 2022, \u201cmany of them stranded for weeks in uninhabitable forests and exposed to violent practices at the border.\u201d",
      "People suffered from exhaustion, hypothermia, dehydration and mental health issues. Last year, it noted \u201ca sharp increase in people carrying the scars of physical assaults, including bruises and dog bites.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to independently verify such reports. The area is off limits. NGOs and media must apply for a permit to enter. EU and international agencies that work with migrants are not invited either, although migrants are provided with their contact details should they want to complain.",
      "Stasiulewicz said those who force their way in \u201care sent back to Belarus, which is in line with our legal framework.\u201d",
      "The Norwegian Refugee Council, a migrant aid charity, has another take. It said that nearly 9,000 \u201cviolent pushbacks \u201d have been reported by NGOs in what it describes as \u201cEurope\u2019s death zone\u201d since 2021.",
      "Pushbacks \u2013 depriving someone who may be in fear for their safety of their right to apply for asylum \u2013 are illegal under international law.",
      "Polish Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk rejects the pushback allegations. He prefers \"turnbacks.\u201d The rationale is that migrants are obliged to apply for asylum in good faith at open border points, not force their way in.",
      "The nearest place they can do that is in Terespol, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Po\u0142owce.",
      "As far as the Polish authorities are concerned, their methods are working. The number of people arriving in Po\u0142owce has dropped significantly. Around 670 people applied for asylum there last year, and none to mid-January. The Office for Foreigners was empty when reporters visited.",
      "To keep numbers down, the government intends to suspend asylum applications in times of crisis.",
      "A draft law winding its way through parliament would see the border shut for 60 days if Warsaw suspects that migrants are being \u201cweaponized\u201d \u2014 should they approach the border in large groups, try to intimidate Polish officers or damage border infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf anyone uses violence against the border guards, we close the border,\u201d Duszczyk said.",
      "Doctors Without Borders says this could have \u201cdramatic consequences.\u201d It\u2019s urged Poland \u201cto drastically change course of action\" and do all it can to protect migrants and refugees.",
      "But EU leaders signed off on Poland\u2019s actions at a summit last month. Countries on Europe\u2019s eastern flank received a greenlight to suspend the right to protection when they believe that Belarus and Russia are \u201c weaponizing\u201d migrants.",
      "Ultimately, security and migration policies are highly politicized. Tusk has been in power for more than a year but his party\u2019s candidate in a presidential election in May faces a strong challenge from a nationalist opponent.",
      "The EU shifted further right in June after elections to the European Parliament, with nationalists and populists shaking Europe\u2019s foundations, particularly in major powers France and Germany. Tusk believes that tough migration policy can win back voters.",
      "\u201cIf we do not want to hand over these matters to radicals, extremists, populists, we must find the right answers so that no one in the world doubts that democratic states are able to effectively defend themselves against illegal migration,\u201d he said on Friday.",
      "He described the \u201ctough protection\" of borders as a \"sacred duty.\u201d Poland\u2019s borders also make up the 27-nation EU\u2019s external frontier. For Tusk, his country\u2019s security is Europe\u2019s security. It's a similar argument made by Hungary's staunchly nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",

      "Billionaire's wealth has grown faster last year, and now the world can expect at least 5 trillionaires within a decade, even as the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990",
      "DAVOS, Switzerland -- Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Joe Biden last week of a \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\u201d The group's sharp-edged report, titled \u201cTakers Not Makers,\u201d also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation \u2014 including his own \u2014 and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\u201d Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about one specific individual. It\u2019s the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\u201d he added.",
      "Like Biden\u2019s call for making billionaires \u201cbegin to pay their fair share\u201d through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam \u2014 a global advocacy group \u2014 called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \u201cdismantle the new aristocracy.\u201d",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \u201cliving wages\u201d to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \u201cbarely changed\u201d since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaire List\u201d as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \u201cminted\u201d every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \u201ccrony connections,\u201d it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \u201cGlobal Risks Report,\u201d which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \u201csocietal polarization\u201d \u2014 a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets. Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday."

      "A Colombian official says more than 80 people have been killed in the country\u2019s northeast region following failed attempts by the government to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army",
      "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia -- More than 80 people were killed in the country\u2019s northeast over the weekend following the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said.",
      "Twenty others were injured in the violence that has forced thousands to flee as Colombia's army scrambled to evacuate people on Sunday, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings took place.",
      "Among the victims are community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday.",
      "Officials said the attacks happened in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped.",
      "Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters.",
      "\u201cWe were caught in the crossfire,\" said Juan Guti\u00e9rrez, who fled with his family to a temporary shelter in Tib\u00fa after they were forced to leave behind their animals and belongings. \u201cWe had no time to grab our things. ... I hope the government remembers us. ... We are helpless here.\u201d",
      "Colombia\u2019s army rescued dozens of people on Sunday, including a family and their pet dog, whose owner held a pack of cold water against the animal\u2019s chest to keep it cool as they evacuated by helicopter.",
      "Defense Minister Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez traveled to the northeast town of C\u00facuta on Sunday where he held several security meetings and urged armed groups to demobilize.",
      "\u201cThe priority is to save lives and guarantee the security of communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have deployed our troops throughout the entire region.\u201d",
      "Officials also prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Oca\u00f1a and Tib\u00fa, the majority of them having fled the violence.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo needs help,\u201d Villamizar said in a public address on Saturday. \u201cBoys, girls, young people, teenagers, entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.\u201d",
      "The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year.",
      "Colombia\u2019s government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cDisplacement is killing us here in the region,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Trinidad, a municipal official for the town of Convenci\u00f3n, located in the North Santander region. \u201cWe're afraid the crisis will worsen.\u201d",
      "Trinidad called on insurgent groups to sit down and hammer out a new agreement so \u201cus civilians don't have to suffer the consequences that we're suffering right now.\u201d",
      "The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations.",
      "In a statement Saturday, the ELN said it had warned former FARC members that if they \u201ccontinued attacking the population ... there was no other way out than armed confrontation.\u201d The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby.",
      "Army commander Gen. Luis Emilio Cardozo Santamar\u00eda said Saturday that authorities were reinforcing a humanitarian corridor between Tib\u00fa and C\u00facuta for the safe passage of those forced to flee their homes. He said special urban troops also were deployed to municipal capitals \u201cwhere there are risks and a lot of fear.\u201d",
      "The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky."

      "KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place on Sunday, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war.",
      "Majida Abu Jarad made quick work of packing the contents of her family\u2019s temporary lodging in the sprawling tent city of Muwasi, just north of the strip\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "At the start of the war, they were forced to flee their house in Gaza\u2019s northern town of Beit Hanoun, where they used to gather around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine.",
      "The house from those fond memories is gone, and for the past year, Abu Jarad, her husband and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, following one evacuation order after another by the Israeli military.",
      "Seven times they fled, she said, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them as they crowded with strangers to sleep in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.",
      "Now the family is preparing to begin the trek home \u2014 or to whatever remains of it \u2014 and to reunite with relatives who remained in the north.",
      "\u201cAs soon as they said that the truce would start on Sunday, we started packing our bags and deciding what we would take, not caring that we would still be living in tents,\u201d Abu Jarad said.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "The Israeli military bombardment that followed the attack has flattened large swaths of Gaza and displaced 1.9 million of its 2.3 million residents.",
      "Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Even before the ceasefire officially took effect \u2014 and as tank shelling continued overnight and into the morning \u2014 many Palestinians began trekking through the wreckage to reach their homes, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re returning to retrieve their loved ones under the rubble,\u201d said Mohamed Mahdi, a displaced Palestinian and father of two. He was forced to leave his three-story home in Gaza City\u2019s southeastern Zaytoun neighborhood a few months ago.",
      "Mahdi managed to reach his home Sunday morning, walking amid the rubble from western Gaza. On the road he said he saw the Hamas-run police force being deployed to the streets in Gaza City, helping people returning to their homes.",
      "Despite the vast scale of the destruction and uncertain prospects for rebuilding, \u201cpeople were celebrating,\" he said. \"They started clearing the streets and removing the rubble of their homes. It\u2019s a moment they\u2019ve waited for for 15 months.\u201d",
      "Um Saber, a 48-year-old widow and mother of six, returned to her hometown of Beit Lahiya. She asked to be identified only by her honorific, meaning \u201cmother of Saber,\u201d out of safety concerns.",
      "Speaking by phone, she said her family had found bodies in the street as they trekked home, some of which appeared to have been lying in the open for weeks.",
      "When they reached Beit Lahiya, they found their home and much of the surrounding area reduced to rubble, she said. Some families immediately began digging through the debris in search of missing loved ones. Others began trying to clear areas where they could set up tents.",
      "Um Saber said she also found the area's Kamal Adwan Hospital \u201ccompletely destroyed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a hospital at all,\u201d she said. \"They destroyed everything.\u201d",
      "The hospital has been hit multiple times by Israeli forces waging an offensive in largely isolated northern Gaza against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped.",
      "The military has claimed that Hamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan, which hospital officials have denied.",
      "In Gaza\u2019s southern city of Rafah, residents returned to find massive destruction across the city that was once a hub for displaced families fleeing Israel\u2019s bombardment elsewhere. Some found human remains amid the rubble of houses and the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an indescribable scene. It\u2019s like you see in a Hollywood horror movie,\u201d said Mohamed Abu Taha, a Rafah resident, speaking to The Associated Press as he and his brother were inspecting his family home. \u201cFlattened houses, human remains, skulls and other body parts, in the street and in the rubble.\u201d",
      "He shared footage of piles of rubble that he said had been his family\u2019s house. \u201cI want to know how they destroyed our home.\u201d",
      "The families' return to their homes comes amid looming uncertainty about whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt.",
      "Not all families will be able to return home immediately. Under the terms of the deal, returning displaced people will only be able to cross the Netzarim corridor from south to north beginning seven days into the ceasefire.",
      "At that point, the agreement says civilians would be allowed to cross into the north on foot without being searched, while a private company to be agreed upon by Israel and the mediators would search vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the ceasefire will continue (and be) permanent, so that we can return to our homes and our children can return to their schools,\u201d Rami Nofal, a displaced man from Gaza City, said from his shelter in the central city of Deir al-Balah.",
      "Those who do return may face a long wait to rebuild their houses.",
      "The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including more than 245,000 homes. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take more than 15 years just to clear the rubble away.",
      "But for many families, the immediate relief overrode fears about the future.",

    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal.",
      "The resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu's governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections.",
      "It was the latest act of defiance by the 48-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel\u2019s most influential politicians.",
      "Here is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:",
      "The ceasefire will pause the war and free dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.",
      "Ahead of the resignation, he said the ceasefire was \u201creckless\u201d and would \u201cdestroy all of Israel\u2019s achievements.\u201d",
      "In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country\u2019s police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.",
      "He also has paid multiple visits to Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site \u2014 the contested hilltop compound that houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque \u2014 including last month. In one such visit in July, he said he came to pray for the return of the hostages \u201cbut without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\u201d",
      "The move, while legal, was seen as a provocation, violated a longstanding ban on Jewish prayer there, and threatened to disrupt months of sensitive negotiations. The site is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.",
      "Ben-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. As a teen, his views were so extreme that the army banned him from compulsory military service.",
      "Ben-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late racist rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.",
      "\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.",
      "Two years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O\u2019Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.",
      "The political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.",
      "Ben-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "With a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.",
      "Ben-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents, and in the past has encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood, while brandishing a pistol. As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.",
      "Ben-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party, into power.",
      "\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve been on a mission to save Israel,\u201d Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. \u201cMillions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.\u201d",
      "Ben-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure \u2014 encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu's contentious attempt to overhaul the country's legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.",
      "In May, Ben-Gvir criticized Joe Biden when the U.S. president threatened to withhold certain military aid if Israel invaded Rafah. Ben-Gvir, using a heart emoji in a post on the social media platform X, wrote that Hamas loves Biden.",
      "Ben-Gvir's departure does not endanger the ceasefire, and Netanyahu still has a narrow parliamentary majority needed to keep power.",
      "But if other hard-liners follow suit, Netanyahu's government could collapse, which would trigger early elections.",
      "\u201cIt's probable that he has less survival time,\u201d said Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and analyst for Israeli public television station Kan News.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid has said he will provide a political safety net to Netanyahu to ensure the government will not fall over the deal.",
      "But such a partnership is unlikely to last beyond the ceasefire because the two men do not get along and would have a difficult time working together, said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel with the International Crisis Group."

      "Across Russia, the devout and the daring celebrate Epiphany on Jan. 19 by immersing themselves in frigid water through holes cut through the ice of lakes and rivers, imitating the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan.",
      "Many extol the practice as strengthening both the soul and the body, although rescue workers are on hand in case anyone succumbs to the heart-racing shock of the icy immersion.",
      "But unusually warm temperatures have prompted local emergency services in some regions to cancel events, saying the ice is too thin for worshippers to bathe safely.",
      "Ceremonies have been canceled in areas as distant as the southern Russian region of Saratov and Karelia, almost 1000 miles away on the country\u2019s border with Finland.",
      "Other regions have vowed to carry on with their ceremonies, although melting ice is not the only concern. In the Russian city of Anapa, officials said that the ritual would be held at its traditional place on the Black Sea, despite the thousands of tons of oil that fell into the nearby Kerch Strait on Dec. 15 when two Russian oil tankers sank in bad weather.",
      "Temperatures across Russia have been increasing over the past quarter of a century in line with global warming, says meteorologist Leonid Starkov, who works for Moscow\u2019s Gismeteo.",
      "\u201cA large part of Russia will be warm for these Epiphany celebrations. The average temperature significantly exceeds the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are already seeing a thaw in St. Petersburg. In Moscow, we are seeing a thaw. And in southern Russia, the temperature is already reaching 5 degrees or 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).\u201d",
      "Officials have reacted so far by creating alternative sites for bathers, often in smaller rivers and lakes. The water is still cold enough to send some worshippers scurrying to wrap themselves in large towels, while onlookers watch on wrapped in scarves, hats and coats.",
      "But Russians will need to adapt to a future where extreme or unseasonable weather is more common, says Starkov \u2014 at both ends of the spectrum.",
      "\u201cOut of the six Epiphany celebrations over the past 25 years where the temperature was colder than usual, five were very cold. Extremes in the weather are increasing,\u201d Starkov said."

      "A senior Taliban figure has urged the group's leader to scrap education bans on Afghan women and girls, saying there is no excuse for them, in a rare public rebuke of government policy.",
      "Sher Abbas Stanikzai, political deputy at the Foreign Ministry, made the remarks in a speech on Saturday in southeastern Khost province.",
      "He told an audience at a religious school ceremony there was no reason to deny education to women and girls, \u201cjust as there was no justification for it in the past and there shouldn\u2019t be one at all.\u201d",
      "The government has barred females from education after sixth grade. Last September, there were reports authorities had also stopped medical training and courses for women.",
      "In Afghanistan, women and girls can only be treated by female doctors and health professionals. Authorities have yet to confirm the medical training ban.",
      "\u201cWe call on the leadership again to open the doors of education,\" said Stanikzai in a video shared by his official account on the social platform X. \"We are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a population of 40 million, depriving them of all their rights. This is not in Islamic law, but our personal choice or nature.\u201d",
      "Stanikzai was once the head of the Taliban team in talks that led to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.",
      "It is not the first time he has said that women and girls deserve to have an education. He made similar remarks in September 2022, a year after schools closed for girls and months and before the introduction of a university ban.",
      "But the latest comments marked his first call for a change in policy and a direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 01:06:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago",
    "story": [
      "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago",
      "NAIVASHA, Kenya -- For someone who fishes for a living, nothing says a bad day like spending over 18 hours on a lake and taking home nothing.",
      "Recently, a group of fishermen were said to be stranded on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha for that long and blamed the water hyacinth that has taken over large parts of it.",
      "\u201cThey did not realize that the hyacinth would later entrap them,\u201d said fellow fisherman Simon Macharia. The men even lost their nets, he said.",
      "The water hyacinth is native to South America and was reportedly introduced to Kenya in the 1980s \u201cby tourists who brought it as an ornamental plant,\u201d said Gordon Ocholla, an environmental scientist at Mount Kenya University.",
      "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago. Now it has become a large, glossy mat that can cover swathes of the lake. To fishermen, the invasive plant is a threat to livelihoods.",
      "Usually, the presence of water hyacinth is linked to pollution. It is known to thrive in the presence of contaminants and grows quickly, and is considered the most invasive aquatic plant species in the world, Ocholla said. It can prevent the penetration of sunlight and impact airflow, affecting the quality of aquatic life.",
      "This has caused a drastic drop in the population of fish in Lake Naivasha and some other affected areas.",
      "The East African Journal of Environment and Natural Resources estimated in a 2023 study that the invasion of water hyacinth in Kenyan lakes \u2014 including Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria \u2014 has led to annual losses of between $150 million and $350 million in Kenya's fishing, transport and tourism sectors.",
      "The fishermen at Lake Naivasha know that well.",
      "\u201cPreviously we would catch up to 90 kilograms (198 pounds) of fish per day, but nowadays we get between 10 kilograms and 15 kilograms,\u201d Macharia said.",
      "This means daily earnings have dropped from $210 to $35.",
      "Fishermen say they have tried to tackle the invasion of water hyacinth but with little success.",
      "\u201cIt grows back faster than we can remove it,\u201d Macharia said.",
      "There are several ways to deal with the plant, including physically removing it, Ocholla said. Another method is introducing organisms that feed on it. Or chemicals can be sprayed to kill the plant, \u201cbut this is not favorable as it would harm other aquatic life.\u201d",
      "Several attempts have been made to convert the plant into a useful commodity.",
      "\u201cThe government had built a biogas processor near the lake where we were supposed to take the hyacinth, but it has never been operational,\u201d Macharia said. He did not know why.",
      "Recently the fishermen, through a Kenyan start-up, began using a method that converts water hyacinth into biodegradable packaging.",
      "HyaPak started in 2022 as a project at Egerton University in Kenya. It seeks to create environmentally friendly packaging.",
      "\u201cOn one hand there is a problem of water hyacinth, and a problem of plastic waste pollution on the other. What we are trying to do is using one problem, the hyacinth, to solve the plastic waste pollution,\u201d HyaPak founder Joseph Nguthiru said.",
      "He said he created the project following a disastrous field excursion that left him and his classmates stuck on Lake Naivasha.",
      "HyaPak has entered a partnership with the fishermen, who harvest the water hyacinth and sun-dry it for a negotiable fee. Then it is transported to the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute in Nairobi, where HyaPak is located.",
      "There, it is mixed with what Nguthiru called \u201cproprietary additives\u201d and converted into biodegradable paper material.",
      "HyaPak is targeting the agriculture sector, creating biodegradable bags for seedlings. The bags decompose with time, releasing nutrients that Nguthiru said are beneficial to the plants.",
      "HyaPak works with 50 fishermen at Lake Naivasha, including Macharia. The company said it processes up to 150 kilograms of water hyacinth per week, converting it to 4,500 biodegradable packages.",
      "Experts said scaling up such work will be a challenge.",
      "\u201cSuch solutions and others that have been applied by similar start-ups may be promising and actually work, but if they cannot be scaled to a higher level that matches the invasiveness of the water hyacinth, then the problem will still persist,\u201d Ocholla said.",

      "MILAN -- The independent Italian fashion brand Simon Cracker denounced the luxury fashion system with an upcycled collection previewed during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday that riffed on what they see as bygone days of quality and creativity.",
      "The coed looks created from recovered and deadstock garments, materials and accessories included a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Hermes\u2019 highly prized Birkin bag, with the designers drawing the telltale hardware on leather bags or screen-printing images of the coveted bag on sweaters.",
      "Co-creative directors Simone Botte and Filippo Biraghi were delighted that Walmart came out with what was widely seen as a Birkin knockoff while they were working on this collection.",
      "\u201cPeople have lost interest in fashion,'' Biraghi said. \"They have been taken for a ride for 20 years. And with 50 wars in the world, climate change, we all are getting poorer. There is no longer a connection between price and value. At a certain point, you can't go on.\u2019\u2019",
      "The collection pokes fun at the typical Milanese signora, known in dialect as sciura, sending her up with funky tweed separates, a foulard and even a tiny dog. Each silhouette is unique, constructed from garments the pair recover from dry cleaners and other sources, and models slide into character with insouciant slouches and exaggerated catwalk strides.",
      "The brand extended its collaboration with Doc Martens, decorated with trompe l\u2019oeil ballerina shoes. At times, skirts, collars and decorative fringe were fashioned out of shiny tinsel packing material, and ribbons covered shoes.",

      "Most of that expansion \u2014 a full 80% \u2014 was due to price increases that outpaced innovation, the McKinsey-Business of Fashion report said.",
      "The Bain consultancy similarly has forecast a contraction of 2% for 2025, the first since the Great Recession, not including the 2020 pandemic year. It cited a crisis in creativity along side global turbulence.",

      "\u201cIf a garment is not interesting, it it doesn\u2019t tell a story, if there is nothing creative, who cares,'' said Biraghi. \u201cWe all have lots of clothes, too many. We don\u2019t need more.\u201d",
      "Italian singer Chiara Galiazzo was in the front row dressed in a pinstripe and plaid jacket painted in sky blue and worn with royal blue Bermuda cutoffs and matching painted boots. She said she was drawn to the brand by its authenticity.",

      "While the Milan Fall-Winter 2025-2026 runway was full of faux fur collars, Prada went the usual step beyond and created primitive detailing in shearling that looked almost torn from the beast and set askew on outerwear lapels, or patchworked into garments.",
      "\u201cMaybe, it reads as savage, primitive cavemen. I think that our aim was to make it feel warm and human and instinctive, but also kind of beautifully domestic in a way,\u201d Simons said backstage.",
      "Cinematic references were broad and not specific to any film, director or even character type, Simons said. Western touches included scuffed cowboy boots and knitwear mimicking a wrangler\u2019s shirt - without creating characters or caricatures.",
      "Feminine touches flourished. Men were invited to wear jewelry, such as bracelets with mini basketballs or baseballs. Chains with amulets hung from fine knits. Fake fur-lined hoods came in florals.",
      "The silhouette mixed skinny trousers, often in bright rock-and-roll satin, with more ample volumes like pajama tops or slightly ratty sweaters. Suits required no shirts, as the designers advocated instinctive dressing.",
      "One look seemed to distill the collection to its boyish essence: Straight leg jeans with a knit top featuring striped detailing, worn with floral-stamped cowboy boots.",
      "The designers said the collection was meant to offer hope in difficult times, proffering humanity as a form of resistance to whatever may be oppressing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an answer to what of course is happening. We have to resist with our instinct, with our humanity, with our passion, with our romance,\u2019\u2019 Prada said backstage. Good work, she said, is also a form of resistance.",
      "The message contained in the collection \"has to be optimistic by definition and in principle,\u2019\u2019 Prada said.",
      "The ever-transforming showroom inside the Prada Foundation\u2019s Deposito contemporary art space was sheathed in Art Noveau carpet, and the runway was set on raised metal scaffolding. Simons said it represented contrasts, decoration and a work-in-progress.",
      "Suits require no shirts. Two puffers are better than one. Raw shearling collars let loose primitive instincts. Subtle jewelry and florals for men. Cowboy boots.",
      "Prada's front row hailed from across the globe and disciplines, including British actor and musician William Gao, arriving with British musician Olivia Hardy, U.S. actor Keith Powers, South Korean actress Kim Tae-ri, Chinese table tennis player Ma Long and British actor Louis Patridge.

Reviews don\u2019t generally affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls.

      "A settlement has been reached by North Carolina's Insurance Department and the industry that sells homeowner policies",
      "RALEIGH. N.C. -- Base rates for North Carolina homeowners' insurance premiums will increase on average by about 15% by mid-2026 as part of a settlement reached by the state Insurance Department and the industry.",
      "The agreement announced Friday by Commissioner Mike Causey contrasts with the January 2024 request by the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies, seeking a 42.2% overall average increase.",
      "Causey, an elected official who began his third term earlier this month, formally rejected the bureau's request last year. That led to a formal hearing that began in October and included multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments. The state Insurance Department said its witnesses would contend rates should be lowered or increased by less than 3%.",
      "Except for the settlement, a hearing officer \u2014 in consultation with Causey \u2014 would have decided what the new rates should be. The Rate Bureau could have appealed that decision in court.",
      "Causey said in a news release that the proposed rate increases \u201care sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims.\"",
      "The bureau attributed its large request to high inflation \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms and \u201cseverely inadequate\u201d premium rates to cover claims. The bureau\u2019s requested increases had varied widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to over 99% in some beach areas.",
      "The agreed-upon increases, carried out in two parts, will vary based on location. On average statewide, the base rate will increase by 7.5% on June 1 and by another 7.5% on June 1, 2026.",
      "The highest increases generally will occur in parts of eastern North Carolina hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. For example, beach areas from Carteret to Brunswick counties will see an average 16% increase in mid-2025 and an additional 15.9% in mid-2026.",
      "Areas harmed the most by historic flooding from Hurricane Helene in the fall will face lower-than-average increases. Base rates in Buncombe, Watauga and Yancey counties, for example, will increase by 4.4% in 2025 and 4.5% in mid-2026.",
      "Among highly populated areas, base rates in Raleigh and Durham will increase on average by 7.5% in each of the next two years. In Charlotte, rates would increase by 9.3% in 2025 and by 9.2 % in 2026.",
      "The settlement also bars the Rate Bureau from undertaking an effort to increase rates again before June 1, 2027, Causey's release said.",
      "Bureau Chief Operating Officer Jarred Chappell said separately that the settlement is \u201ca step in the right direction\" but that the bureau had asked for a larger increase \u201cbecause that\u2019s what recent claims data called for.\"",
      "\"Storms have gotten stronger and more damaging, more people are living in disaster-prone areas, inflation in the construction industry has been particularly high and reinsurance costs have exploded. All these cost drivers remain an issue,\u201d Chappell said in a written statement.",
      "North Carolina insurance law contains a \u201cconsent-to-rate\u201d exception that allows industry members to insure high-risk homeowners if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau\u2019s rate.",
      "While some insurers have pulled out of disaster-prone parts of North Carolina, the exception has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers from the state. About 40% of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policies were set by consent-to-rate policies in 2022, The News & Observer reported."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

    "story": [
      "A fire at a one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy sources",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A fire at one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in Northern California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy and have become a growing electricity source.",
      "By a long shot, California and Texas are opening more large-scale battery projects than anywhere else in the U.S., bolstering power reliability in two large states where extreme weather fueled by climate change has led to electricity shortages and blackouts.",
      "The fire that started Thursday at the Vistra Energy battery plant in Moss Landing, roughly 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) south of San Francisco, led to 1,700 people evacuating, closed part of Highway 1 and generated huge flames and significant amounts of smoke. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Experts say lithium batteries are a safe technology essential for lowering carbon emissions and making grids more reliable. Still, residents near the fire expressed concerns about the impact.",
      "In Texas, which is bracing for another blast of Artic winter weather next week, officials have credited batteries with helping stabilize the state\u2019s independent grid, which was pushed to the brink of collapse during a deadly winter storm in 2021.",
      "Here\u2019s how and why batteries are booming in the two states:",
      "Both Texas and California grapple with blackouts while trying to meet the energy needs of tens of millions of people as well as industry, including artificial intelligence and data centers.",
      "Batteries soak up excess wind and solar energy for later use. That backup supply helps the grid during times of high demand, such as during a heat wave, when air conditioning use is heavy.",
      "The cost of lithium batteries has dropped dramatically, boosting their popularity. For electric vehicle lithium batteries, as an example, prices fell by about 90% between 2008 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Office.",
      "Cheaper lithium has made utility-scale batteries more cost-competitive than some natural gas alternatives. Batteries can also be switched on and discharge power in a matter of seconds.",
      "The Texas grid is rapidly gaining utility-scale batteries and added a whopping 5 gigawatts of storage over the last year, helping to keep up with demand and avoid blackouts.",
      "The 2021 blackout and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have helped drive the expansion. Texas\u2019 deregulatory environment has also allowed wind and solar projects to develop quickly and easily, increasing the demand for batteries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less red tape that power plants have to go through in Texas,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cTexas generally doesn\u2019t have any regulations that stop development.\u201d",
      "Some experts say the cheaper cost of batteries is fueling their rapid adoption more than anything, however.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a story of regulation as it is economic efficiency,\u201d said Jay Turner, professor of environmental science at Wellesley College. \u201cThe price of batteries and renewable generation has fallen so much that batteries and solar and wind, when put together, are so cost-competitive.\u201d",
      "The state has long pursued sustainable energy and in 2002 created a set of clean energy standards that the International Energy Agency considers one of the most ambitious in the nation.",
      "As solar and wind became increasingly popular, there were concerns that it would be extremely challenging to integrate that energy into the grid because of their intermittent nature.",
      "\u201cEven back in 2005, it was like any more than 15% renewables on the grid would be impossible,\u201d said Sally Benson, professor of energy science engineering at Stanford University. Last year California had more than 11 gigawatts of utility-scale storage on the grid.",
      "Part of California\u2019s motivation to act stems from electricity shortages. In 2020 the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ordered rotating outages because the grid was overwhelmed with demand during a heat wave.",
      "Since then several gigawatts of battery storage has been added, a major reason CAISO hasn\u2019t ordered rotating outages in nearly four years, according to Denise Grab, an energy policy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

      "With President-elect Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "WASHINGTON -- In one of her last acts as Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen said her agency will start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, on January 21 in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "She sent a letter in late December to lawmakers stating that Treasury expected to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23. And now, the agency will stop paying into certain accounts, including the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, to make up for the shortfall in money beginning Tuesday.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",

      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",

And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",

      "Few Democrats found ways to negotiate with Republicans quite like Shalanda Young \u2014 whose work as White House budget director stopped several potential economic crises from erupting",
      "WASHINGTON -- Few Democrats found ways to negotiate with Republicans quite like Shalanda Young \u2014 whose work as White House budget director stopped several potential economic crises from erupting.",
      "She brokered a 2023 deal to stop the government from defaulting on its debt. She worked to keep the government from shutting down, preserve disaster relief and address a baby formula shortage. She helped save aid to Ukraine with a loan based on frozen Russian assets.",
      "Young may have been the most powerful low-profile person in the Biden administration. And while President Joe Biden leaves office with a dismal approval rating and a mixed legacy, she departs as the director of the Office of Management and Budget with a record with more wins than losses.",
      "Her formula for success: a blend of understanding the arcana of federal spending, reading the politics of the moment, and convincing reluctant lawmakers that compromise was in their interest.",
      "\u201cShe was an enormous challenge to negotiate with because of her skills, her intelligence and her wicked sense of humor,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. \u201cI mean that as the highest of compliments.\u201d",
      "Sitting on a couch in her high-ceilinged office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Young attributed her success to \"giving Republicans who want to do the right thing the political space to do that.\u201d",
      "Now, the incoming Trump administration will face some of the same vexing issues: raising the debt limit, preparing a budget and figuring out how to extend roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts set to expire after this year while also taming a budget deficit expected to be $1.9 trillion.",
      "Trump has nominated his previous budget director Russell Vought to return to the post. With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, Vought won't necessarily need Young's nimble political skills. At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, he declined to say whether he would allow the remaining Ukraine aid to be spent in accordance with Congress' wishes.",
      "For their part, Democrats will no longer have Young as a deal broker. At 47, Young, whose judgment was honed by nearly 15 years as a House Appropriations Committee staffer, feels no need to sugarcoat the hard math.",
      "She figured out how to balance conflicting issues caused by the mix of challenging numbers and toxic partisanship. She also did it while juggling the challenge of being a single parent to her daughter, Charlie, 3 \u2014 meaning that her evening phone calls with lawmakers, cabinet officials and others often had the soundtrack of cooing and crying.",
      "\u201cTo talk to me is to know I have a child,\" Young said.",
      "She had decided to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments, believing that a woman could take the most high-powered of government jobs as well as handle the demanding work of parenthood.",
      "It meant a messy existence of little sleep, high-pressure phone calls and only four weeks of maternity leave.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a choice. I wanted the job and I wanted to at least have a shot at being a parent, and both had a high likelihood of failure,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose chaos.\u201d",
      "The process of parenthood also changed her. She wondered how parents with fewer resources could make it, and concluded that people working 40 hours a week ought to be able to afford decent child care and health care.",
      "Young sees much of her approach stemming from how she grew up in Clinton, Louisiana, where her grandmother came out of retirement to be her middle school basketball coach. She stressed to her that she needed to live as a role model would: \"You don\u2019t know what young girl is watching you. So you are always to be on your best behavior. Be a leader of this team.\"",
      "That guided how she drives a deal. She let lawmakers, colleagues and even the president be human. When she negotiated on Ukraine funding, she thought about visiting that country as a congressional staffer and her trip to a child center there, where she played with the kids.",
      "When negotiations were faltering in 2023 to raise the debt ceiling, she worried about a growing number of Republicans who seemed to view default as an acceptable risk. But she says there is still enough of a governing majority who understood the threat to the nation and their constituents.",
      "The talks had become a circus on Capitol Hill, with reporters chasing the negotiators, so she moved negotiations to the Office of Management and Budget conference room with its relative privacy on the White House campus. She said she needed to get the right Republicans, such as McHenry, in the room.",
      "After agreeing on top-line numbers, Republicans said they needed to be able to go to their fellow lawmakers with work requirements on people who receive food aid. Young agreed to their terms, knowing some would lose benefits.",
      "To ultimately settle the deal, Young needed to bring Biden back from a foreign trip in Asia. At their final meeting on a May Friday, Young felt confident she had a deal. But she needed to fly to New Orleans to deliver a commencement speech at Xavier University. Her final phone calls ended at 3 a.m. and she then spent Saturday morning on the phone with Biden going over the deal.",
      "\u201cI'm glad I went,\u201d she said of the speech, but then added with laughter, \u201cThat weekend almost killed me.\u201d",
      "For her part, Young admitted she was most nervous to present the deal to Democratic lawmakers, scared that they might tear her head off for the resulting compromise.",
      "Instead, she got a standing ovation from the room.",
      "\u201cI cried like a baby,\u201d she said.",
      "Young has a position lined up for life after the White House, but it hasn't been announced yet. She said she's looking forward to the idea of living with just one cellphone."

      "But questions remain. Here's a look at the various connections and potential conflicts in Trump\u2019s second administration.",

Another coffee table book, \u201cSave America,\" features reminiscences from Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns and term in office, as well as a lengthy reflection about his brush with death during a July assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania.",
      "Campaign finance records show Trump\u2019s political fundraising committees have paid Winning Team Publishing more than $242,000 for unspecified books and printing services.",
      "The company also publishes titles written by Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk.",
      "Trump\u2019s name and image are branded on a dizzying array of merchandise that he promotes and profits from through licensing agreements, including Bibles, diamond-encrusted watches, gold-colored sneakers and guitars that cost as much as $10,000.",
      "Thousands of copies of the \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d Bible Trump sells were printed in China, a country he has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices. As president, Trump would be able to exempt Bibles and other religious texts from hefty tariffs he\u2019s threatened to impose on imported Chinese products.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of a line of guitars led to a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter from Nashville-based Gibson Guitars. A company representative said in a brief statement the design of the Trump guitars infringes upon Gibson\u2019s exclusive trademarks, particularly the body shape of the company\u2019s iconic Les Paul model.",
      "Judgments of more than half a billion dollars from civil lawsuits hang over Trump and will be more difficult to avoid than the criminal cases brought by the federal government and then abandoned after his election in November.",
      "A New York judge ordered Trump and his companies earlier this year to pay more than $450 million after ruling he had manipulated his net worth in financial statements to secure favorable loans. That penalty came shortly after Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for damaging her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault. A separate jury awarded Carroll $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "Trump has appealed the rulings in the fraud case and one of the Carroll cases. His latest financial disclosure list more than $101 million in liabilities stemming from the two cases.",
      "As president, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself for penalties imposed in civil cases unrelated to his official government duties, said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. And because the trials have already occurred, he\u2019ll have difficulty arguing the cases are an undue burden on his time.",
      "The constellation of high-end golf resorts Trump owns or manages generated hundreds of millions of dollars for him in 2024 and may pull in even greater sums once he\u2019s back in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump\u2019s financial disclosure reported close to $267 million in \u201cgolf-related\u201d income, with another $161 million in combined \u201cgolf and hotel\u201d proceeds from his Doral golf club in Miami.",
      "During his first term, Trump frequently promoted his golf courses and routinely played at them with a large, taxpayer-funded entourage in tow, leading to criticism that he was using the power of the presidency to enrich himself. Trump pushed to host the international Group of Seven summit at the Doral property in 2019. But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
      "The golf courses may also attract foreign officials and special interest groups hoping to gain access and curry favor by spending large sums at Trump properties.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s first term in office, the cost to join his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has soared to $1 million, allowing wealthy people to mix pleasure with politics and government business during his frequent visits to the club.",
      "While Trump collects income from Mar-a-Lago \u2014 $111 million over the last two years \u2014 he\u2019s been accused of charging the U.S. Secret Service \u201cexorbitant\u201d room rates of more than $800 per night for agents assigned to protect him when he traveled there and to other Trump family properties.",
      "Who Trump meets with while at Mar-a-Lago and what he discusses are largely hidden from public view. The Secret Service has no electronic systems to screen or monitor presidential visitors to the estate, according to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.",
      "Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "While he\u2019s since been reinstated to both, Trump has often used Truth Social for more personal commentary, leaving traffic on X and other platforms for more formal statements and pronouncements. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many users it has, so it\u2019s hard to know how broad Trump\u2019s reach there is.",
      "But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March. The incoming president has a majority stake in the company, and said shortly after his general election win that he had \u201cNO INTENTION OF SELLING\u201d his shares, which have significantly boosted Trump\u2019s net worth, and at that time were valued at around $3.5 billion.",
      "Trump has promised to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d as he returns to the White House, a promise that would likely pay off for him personally.",
      "Amidst the 2024 campaign, Trump launched a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies that he has promoted on the same social media accounts he used for his campaign. His two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also posted about their new platform, called World Liberty Financial, as has his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric and also serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.",
      "The new moneymaking venture could explode in value if Trump pushes through legislative and regulatory changes long sought by crypto advocates.",
      "During his first term, Trump said he was \u201cnot a fan\u201d of cryptocurrency but he has since taken a more favorable view \u2014 from announcing in May that the campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency to attending a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a Bitcoin \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d using the currency that the government currently holds.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people.",

      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and child birth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\"",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",

      "Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8% from a year earlier. Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5% at an annual rate. Exports expanded 7.1% in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3%.",

      "\u201cThe precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,\u201d Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment.",
      "\u201cThe economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China\u2019s access.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, including reducing banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing.",
      "National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year.",
      "\u201cWith the coordinated efforts of stock policies and a package of incremental policies, the momentum of economic recovery is strengthening, the recovery of consumer demand has accelerated, and there are more favorable factors for a moderate rebound in prices,\u201d he said.",
      "Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand.",
      "Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy.",
      "Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem.",
      "\u201cChina needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,\u201d Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.\""

      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won\u2019t...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "Novak Djokovic has received the apologies he wanted from the Australian Open\u2019s local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic got the mea culpas he wanted from the Australian Open's local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air and so, according to tournament organizers, the 24-time Grand Slam champion is ready to concentrate on his quarterfinal showdown with Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cNovak acknowledges the apology has been given in public as requested,\" read a statement issued Monday by Tennis Australia, \"and is now moving on and focusing on his next match.\u201d",
      "That, perhaps, will draw a curtain on the bizarre off-court distraction as Djokovic pursues what would be an 11th championship at Melbourne Park and a record 25th major trophy overall.",
      "After winning at Rod Laver Arena on Sunday evening to set up the contest against No. 3 Alcaraz, Djokovic declined to do the customary post-match on court TV interview, but didn't immediately say why, eliciting some jeering from spectators. Only later that night, at his news conference, did Djokovic explain that he was taking a stand to protest comments made by Tony Jones on Channel 9 on Friday.",
      "Djokovic, a 37-year-old from Serbia, did not name Jones, but said a \u201cfamous sports journalist who works for official broadcaster Channel 9 ... made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments toward me.\u201d",
      "Jones called Djokovic overrated and a has-been and made what seemed to be a reference to when the player was deported from Australia in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "Djokovic added that he would continue to avoid speaking to the network without an apology from it and Jones.",
      "Those finally arrived on Monday.",
      "Nine Network said in a statement it apologized \u201cfor any offense caused from comments made\" while live on air.",
      "\u201cNo harm was intended towards Novak or his fans,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe look forward to further showcasing his Australian Open campaign at Melbourne Park.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on a TV show Monday, Jones said he intended his words as \u201cbanter\u201d and apologized to Djokovic \u201cif he felt that I disrespected him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI considered it to be humor, which is consistent with most things I do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHaving said that, I was made aware ... that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments. I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued an apology to them. And as I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak.\u201d",
      "Jones also offered words to Serbians.",
      "\u201cI do feel as though I\u2019ve let down the Serbian fans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying this to try and wriggle out of trouble or anything. I genuinely feel for those fans.\u201d",
      "Serbia\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, even got involved Monday, telling the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that Jones\u2019 comments were \u201cclearly unprofessional,\u201d including a \u201cmost concerning\u201d reference to what happened three years ago when Djokovic was kicked out of the country ahead of the tournament amid the pandemic.",
      "Before Jones and his employer offered their apologies, Djokovic posted a message on social media reiterating why he declined to speak. That drew a reply from billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s way better just to talk to the public directly than go through the negativity filter of legacy media.\u201d",
      "Djokovic replied to Musk's tweet with \u201cIndeed\u201d and a raised-hands emoji.",

      "Torborg was a member of the Dodgers' 1965 championship team, but didn't appear in the World Series against Minnesota.",
      "Torborg also spent time as a broadcaster.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day to lose a great man with such high character,\u201d said Robin Ventura, who played for Torborg from 1989-91 with Chicago. \u201cHe was a family man who ran his team like a family. I smile as I think of him in the dugout wearing his soccer cleats as he managed his team.\u201d",

This one, though, will be the first at the Australian Open \u2014 and the first in the quarterfinals of a tournament; each of the others came in either a semifinal or final.",
      "\u201cWell, this is not the right player to play in a quarterfinal, I guess,\u201d a grinning Alcaraz said, looking ahead to Tuesday's encounter. \u201cBut facing Novak, for me, it\u2019s not going to change anything if I\u2019m playing him (in a) quarterfinal or semifinal. Probably change a little bit if it is a final, obviously. Being in a quarterfinal, I\u2019m going to approach the match the same as I did in the previous matches against him, and let\u2019s see.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz reached his 10th career Grand Slam quarterfinal, tied for the most by a man before his 22nd birthday, by advancing when 15th-seeded Jack Draper stopped playing because of a hip injury after dropping the first two sets Sunday afternoon.",
      "Djokovic, who is being coached in Melbourne by old rival Andy Murray, did his part at night in Rod Laver Arena, needing to work a little longer but getting through just the same with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over No. 24 Jiri Lehecka.",
      "Djokovic smacked a ball off a wall in the third set, drawing boos and whistles from some spectators. When they made more noise moments later, chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani admonished the folks in the stands to be more polite toward the players.",
      "Otherwise, though, Djokovic had plenty of support, from the Serbian flags in the stands to the chants of his nickname, \u201cNole,\u201d that reverberated around the main stadium.",
      "Afterward, Djokovic dispensed with the customary on-court interview, instead holding the microphone himself and telling the crowd: \u201cThank you very much for being here tonight. I appreciate your presence and the support. I\u2019ll see you next round. Thank you very much.\u201d Then he walked off.",
      "There is plenty at stake at this tournament for both No. 3 seed Alcaraz, who is 21, and No. 7 Djokovic, who is 37.",
      "Alcaraz seeks to become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam with at least one trophy from all four of the most prestigious events in tennis. His four so far came elsewhere: two at Wimbledon by virtue of wins over Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals, and one apiece at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the French Open last year.",
      "Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to claim an 11th title in Melbourne to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles championships. He leads the overall head-to-head against Alcaraz 4-3, including a victory in the final at the Paris Olympics last August to claim a gold medal for Serbia.",
      "At the majors, though, Alcaraz leads 2-1.",
      "\u201cIf I think about everything he has done in tennis, I couldn\u2019t play. I mean, 24 Grand Slam, the most weeks at No. 1 \u2014 everything. He almost broke every record in tennis. I\u2019m trying not to think about that when I\u2019m in the match. I\u2019m just trying ... to beat him,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI know my weapons. I know that (if) I\u2019m able to play good tennis against him, I\u2019m able to beat him.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Alcaraz was ahead 7-5, 6-1 when Draper decided he couldn't continue. He'd been dealing with physical issues after winning each of his first three matches at Melbourne Park in five sets.",
      "\u201cIt's not the way I want to win a match, to get through to the next round,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cHappy to play another quarterfinal here in Australia, but a little bit sad for Jack.\u201d",
      "Sunday's match goes into the books as a victory for Alcaraz, his first against a top-20 opponent at the Australian Open. He pulled even with Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander for the highest number of major quarterfinal appearances before 22.",
      "Alcaraz's best run at Melbourne Park was getting to the quarterfinals last year, before losing at that stage to Alexander Zverev. The other quarterfinal on the bottom half of the men's bracket will be No. 2 Zverev against No. 12 Tommy Paul.",

Like, I haven\u2019t even stepped on the court, just \u2019cause I started with a five-setter, and my body was a little tired.

      "A year ago, Zverev exited in the semifinals at Melbourne Park for the second time.",
      "Paul was one of four American men to reach the fourth round in Australia this year. No. 21 Ben Shelton, qualifier Learner Tien and Alex Michelsen will try to join him in the quarterfinals when they play fourth-round matches on Monday.",

      "It didn\u2019t take long for Makhachev (27-1-0) after he took down Moicano (20-6-1), as he quickly administered a D\u2019Arce choke.",
      "The 33-year-old Makhachev has the most title fight wins in the division with five, and accomplished what no other fighter in his division had ever done \u2014 successfully defending his belt four times. It was his 13th win by submission.",
      "\u201cI like this belt,\u201d said Makhachev, the UFC\u2019s top-ranked pound-for-pound fighter and the most decorated lightweight ever. \u201cIf somebody wants this belt, come to the cage.\"",
      "Moicano was a last-minute replacement for top-ranked challenger Arman Tsarukyan, who pulled out of the bout Friday because \u201cof significant back pain\u201d related to an injury.",
      "The 35-year-old Moicano, from Brazil, came in with nine victories in his past 10 fights, but proved to be no match for Makhachev, whose grappling has been unmatched as he continues to prove why he\u2019s one of the best in the world",
      "In an epic, action-filled bantamweight title match, champion Merab Dvalishvili (19-4-0) was successful in his first title defense as he extended his winning streak to 12 while handing second-ranked contender Umar Nurmagomedov (18-1-0) the first loss of his career.",
      "The pace of the match saw both fighters dominate at different times in the fight, with Dvalishvili closing strong after two of the three judges had Nurmagomedov leading after the first two rounds.",
      "Nurmagomedov said he felt he broke his left hand, and couldn\u2019t use it after the first round.",
      "In a light heavyweight match, former champion and second-ranked Jiri Prochazka (31-5-1) used a flurry of punches in the third round to overwhelm third-ranked Jamahal Hill (12-3-0) prompting a stoppage at 3:01 for a TKO.",
      "In the heavyweight division, sixth-ranked Jailton Almeida (22-3-0) used a flurry of right hands to hurt seventh-ranked Serghei Spivac (17-5-0) late in the first round and used a ground-and-pound attack to finish the match with a TKO at the 4:53 mark.",
      "Reinier de Ridder (19-2-0) wasted no time in taking down Kevin Holland (26-13-0) roughly 10 seconds into their middleweight bout and finished him off with a rear-naked chokehold at 3:31 of the first round.",

      "The Detroit Lions worked all season to earn the NFC's top seed and ensure they wouldn't have to play anywhere but Ford Field until the Super Bowl",
      "DETROIT -- The Detroit Lions had everything set up the way they wanted this time.",
      "After losing last season's NFC championship game at San Francisco, they went 15-2 to earn the NFC's top seed. They enjoyed a first-round playoff bye and knew they wouldn't have to play anywhere but Ford Field until the Super Bowl.",
      "It didn't matter.",
      "The Lions self-destructed against the Washington Commanders, turning the ball over five times in a 45-31 loss on Saturday night that ended another chance at the franchise's first Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe just didn't complement each other,\u201d said coach Dan Campbell, who nearly came to tears during his postgame news conference. \u201cWe didn't get a stop when we needed one, and when we got a stop, we turned the ball over. With five turnovers \u2014 even if one was at the end and it was really four, that's too much.\u201d",
      "Jared Goff took most of the blame \u2014 he threw three interceptions and lost his first fumble of the season. One of the picks was returned 40 yards for a touchdown by Quan Martin to give the Commanders a 24-14 lead.",
      "\u201cIf I play better, do we win? Quite possibly,\u201d Goff said. \u201cI cost us points by not taking care of the ball, and that's something that's going to hurt for a long time.\u201d",
      "Goff didn't have a great night, but he wasn't playing defense. Washington rookie Jayden Daniels played a lot like Goff at his best \u2014 completing passes that gave his receivers a chance to run. Of his 299 passing yards, 188 came after the catch.",
      "\u201cWe knew what the tape said about him,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe knew we were going to have our hands full and we didn't handle it as well as we wanted.\u201d",
      "That wasn't the only problem, though. Detroit's injury-riddled defense gave up 481 yards \u2014 its third most this season \u2014 including 182 on the ground. Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler combined for 124 yards on 21 carries and Daniels added 51 more.",
      "Detroit didn't sack Daniels \u2014 a problem it has had since losing Aidan Hutchinson to a broken leg in October. Hutchinson had been aiming to return in time for the Super Bowl.",
      "The Lions also lost cornerback Amik Robertson to a broken arm early in the game \u2014 yet another major injury for a depleted unit.",
      "\u201cThat hurt us a bit, but (Kindle Vildor) came in and played well,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe competed for us.\u201d",
      "The injuries didn't explain the mental mistakes, though. Detroit was within 31-28 early in the fourth quarter and had the Commanders facing fourth-and-2 from the Lions 5. A stop could have changed the game \u2014 but the Lions were called for 12 men on the field. Two plays later, Robinson scored to make it 38-28.",
      "Campbell took the blame for the play, but there was still time to rally until an inexplicable decision to have Jameson Williams throw a pass to Jahmyr Gibbs. Williams looked tentative as he rolled right and threw into coverage. Rookie Mike Sainristil grabbed his second interception of the night and Washington ran 4:33 off the clock before scoring another touchdown that made it 45-28.",
      "\u201cObviously, I wish he had run the ball,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Last year, Campbell talked at length about how hard it is to get into position to win a Super Bowl, and how the 49ers loss might have cost the Lions their best chance.",
      "This time, he couldn't even address that topic.",
      "\u201cThis isn't the time \u2014 this hurts too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn't the time to talk about our great season and all our wins. The whole point of playing is to get to the biggest game and we didn't make it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s huge, the level of support, just to get to see them show up and support me means a lot to me. Just gives me a lot of confidence,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cBeing from Maine \u2026 when I was growing up, it\u2019s easy to just not believe in yourself or just think you can\u2019t do that. I just want to keep proving that it doesn\u2019t really matter where you\u2019re from. As long as you stick to it and keep working, you can make anything happen.\u201d",
      "Flagg said he grew up as a Boston sports fan, rooting for the Celtics, Patriots and Red Sox because they were the closest pro teams to his hometown. On Friday night, Flagg and some of his teammates watched the Celtics \u2013 including ex-Blue Devil Jayson Tatum \u2013 beat the Magic. (Orlando\u2019s Paolo Banchero also went to Duke.)",
      "Duke\u2019s only other scheduled trip up North is to play at Syracuse next month, though there is a March Madness regional final in Providence, Rhode Island. Flagg said he had been hearing from a lot of people back home that they would be making the trip; one television reporter told Flagg after the game he had interviewed fans who came down from Aroostook County, on the border of Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada.",
      "\u201cIt was great for us just to be in that environment,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. \u201cWhat a special turnout. Look, this is as close as we\u2019re going to get to Maine. We\u2019ve been here a lot. The representation of Duke fans has always been great. This was, I think, the best I\u2019ve ever seen it.",
      "\u201cAnd I think a lot of it has to do with Maine. So that was a pretty special thing to see,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201cAnd obviously he backed it up with his play.\u201d",

      "The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could bring a cryptocurrency policy blitz in 2025",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",
      "A bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid, Cabell expects a colleague to reintroduce his bill. Leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect legislation based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states this year.",
      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app's savior.",
      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",

      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",

      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",

      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know. Most of them have never been to a race, so seeing this and what it looks like, and understanding there are plenty of things to pursue is just a wonderful gift for them.\u201d",

      "SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- The path to Lost Lake was steep and unpaved, lined with sharp rocks and holes.",
      "A group of scientists and students gingerly made their way, using canes or a helping hand to guide them. For those who couldn't make the trek, a drone brought the lake \u2014 blue and narrow \u2014 into view.",
      "The field trip was designed to illustrate the challenges disabled researchers often face \u2014 and how barriers can be overcome.",
      "\u201cJust because you can\u2019t do it like someone else doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it,\" said Anita Marshall, a University of Florida geologist leading the outing. The group included scientists with sight, hearing and mobility disabilities.",
      "Marshall's organization ran the field trip to the lake along the San Andreas Fault, outside of San Bernadino. Her group \u2014 the International Association for Geoscience Diversity \u2014 and others are working to improve access to field and lab work so that those with disabilities feel welcome and stay.",
      "Taormina Lepore, a Western Michigan University paleontologist who went on the trip, said scientists tend to value a single, traditional way of getting things done.",
      "At Lost Lake, everyone got a view \u2014 even if they couldn\u2019t physically get there.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about empathy, as much as it is about science,\u201d said Lepore, who also researches science education.",
      "Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation.",
      "Scientists with disabilities say that\u2019s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren\u2019t designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they can\u2019t work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation.",
      "The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, sets minimum regulations for new buildings and labs, including ramps and wheelchair-accessible walkways.",
      "But modifying older labs can be a complicated and lengthy process.",
      "Alyssa Paparella is working on her doctorate in biology at Baylor College of Medicine and founded an online community for disabled scientists. She said a science building at one of her former schools had no automatic buttons to open doors.",
      "\u201cWhat is that saying about who you want actually working in the laboratories?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the front door that they\u2019re not even able to get in.\u201d",
      "Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to constantly come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives \u2014 a problem-solving skill that's indispensable in a lab.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t feel welcome, if they don\u2019t get access, then how can they contribute that talent?\u201d Leddy said.",
      "Venu Varanasi, a biomaterials engineer at the University of Texas at Arlington who has low vision, prints out signage using high-contrast color combinations and encourages his students to keep floors and counters clutter-free so he can navigate the lab more easily.",
      "He said those modifications also keep accidents to a minimum for non-disabled students.",
      "\u201cWhen you realize that you have a person with a disability, you have an opportunity, not a problem,\u201d he said.",
      "At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up.",
      "The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.",
      "On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes.",
      "The group included rock enthusiasts at all different stages of their careers. A handful were students. Others were professors, eager to explore the outdoors in a group they could trust to look after them.",
      "Central Connecticut State University professor Jennifer Piatek, who uses a wheelchair, saw the lake through drone footage and used a pocket lens to examine rocks brought back by other participants.",
      "She said it was nice to be part of a community that anticipated her needs. For example, their bus pulled forward to park at a flatter location to make it easier for her to get off.",
      "You can learn a lot from images and maps, \"but really you need to get to the space to be in it,\u201d said Piatek, who studies planetary geology.",
      "Lepore, a neurodivergent person with low vision, scanned rocks using an artificial intelligence app that described their color and shape out loud.",
      "\u201cNature is not inherently accessible,\u201d she said. \u201cNature just doesn\u2019t have ramps and the kinds of things that we might wish it had. But there are so many workarounds and ways that we as geoscientists can make things truly open.\u201d",
      "Bushra Hussaini uses tips from the field trips to support interns and volunteers with disabilities at New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History, where she works. She said the supportive community of geologists is what keeps her coming back. \u201cWe learn from each other and we help each other,\u201d she said.",
      "Before heading out, Marshall urged the participants to ask for a hand or a shoulder to lean on if needed. She and others from the organization have been leading field trips every year as an offshoot from the Geological Society of America's annual meeting.",
      "As a doctoral student, Marshall would go on field trips with her peers only to wait back in the van, frustrated, because the organizers hadn't thought about how to accommodate her disabilities.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life",
      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",

      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s room for lots of winners\u201d Bezos said, adding that this was the \u201cvery, very beginning of this new phase of the space age, where we\u2019re all going to work together as an industry ... to lower the cost of access to space.\"",
      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA's Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency's successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "The residence staff has just hours to move the Bidens out and the Trumps in.",
      "While Inauguration Day marks the transfer of power from one president to another, it also marks another major change at the White House: one first family moving out and another moving in.",
      "This final piece of the transition happens behind closed doors, no cameras allowed.",
      "The residence staff of the White House will be working furiously Monday on deadline to move the Bidens out and the Trumps in.",
      "Gary Walters, the former White House chief usher for 21 years who attended five presidential move-in days, told ABC News the process is \"organized chaos.\"",
      "According to Walters, the activity inside the White House is a well-organized ballet with \"choreography that has to be minute-by-minute.\"",
      "Walters served seven presidents and first families at the White House, including during the Reagan, Clinton, and both Bush administrations.",
      "\"We have approximately five, five-and-a-half hours from the time they leave the North Portico until after the parade,\" he said, emphasizing the short turnaround time.",
      "\"It's somewhere in the vicinity of 110 people and they all have very specific jobs,\" Walters added about the moving teams. \"We also not only have the House, we have the West Wing and, specifically, the president's Oval Office that gets transformed.\"",
      "Moving trucks are ready to go on the White House South Lawn driveway -- empty ones moving away the outgoing family's possessions, as well as ones loaded with the belongings of the incoming family.",
      "The goal is to make the White House feel like home -- or as homey as a 132-room mansion that is also a living museum of American history -- can feel.",
      "\"Are you going to use pieces of furniture that you want to bring into the White House, or are you going to use furniture that is in our inventory, some of which may be there, some of which may be in storage?\" Walters said, shedding light on the questions the staff must ponder.",
      "The staff works frantically to make sure everything is just right when the first family walks into the White House for the first time.",
      "\"The aim of the residence staff is to have the president and the first lady move into their home when they come in from the Pennsylvania Avenue reviewing stand that their snacks are in the kitchen,\" Walters said. \"Their favorite items are where they expect them to be. There are no boxes unopened. They're all open \u2026 It's all set up beforehand. And when they walk in, they don't see any unpacked boxes or extra storage items sitting around.\"",
      "Though this sounds like a wonderful perk of moving into the White House, Walters says this is also a practical reality because the president has to get to work on Day 1.",
      "Amid the chaos, Walters says Inauguration Day can be emotional for the White House residence staff, especially those who have grown close to the outgoing first family.",
      "\"To get together with the president and the first lady is usually quite emotional because ... family and the staff get to know each other pretty well,\" Walters said.",
      "During his time as chief usher, Walters would do something special for the outgoing president.",
      "\"I started a tradition of taking the flag that flew over the White House on the day they took office. And the flag that flew over the White House on the day that they were going to be leaving at midnight the night before,\" Walters explained. \"And we packaged those up in a box made of original White House wood from when the House was rebuilt in 1948, 1952.\"",
      "Walters then presented the flags to the presidents on the morning of their final day in office.",

      "Every four to eight years, over the course of just a few hours, a few dozen members of the White House staff move out the belongings of the outgoing first family and move in the belongings of the new first family.",
      "This Inauguration Day, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will wake up in a White House filled with their belongings and personal mementos -- everything from personal photographs to their favorite foods in the kitchen.",
      "At night, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will go to bed in a White House fully stocked with everything from their clothes to their preferred toothpaste.",
      "\"It\u2019s an amazing day where they have five hours to move one family out and another family in,\" Kate Andersen Brower, author of \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House,\" told ABC News. \"They don't hire movers to do it. They do it themselves, so it's an all-hands-on-deck situation where everybody on the staff pitches in and helps that day.\"",
      "The move traditionally begins in the morning, after the outgoing president and first lady say goodbye to the White House staff, the ushers, butlers, chefs and others staffing 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "The goodbye, held in the State Dining Room, is often an emotional one as the first family and staff have formed a bond, according to Brower, also the author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America\u2019s Modern First Ladies.\"",
      "During the ceremony, the White House staff present the president with the American flags that flew over the White House on the president's first and final days in office. The flags, according to Brower, are presented in a wooden box made by the White House's carpenters.",
      "\"The president and first lady walk around to everybody and say goodbye and hug, and sometimes people cry,\" Brower said. \"It's a really human moment in what seems like a very formal day full of pomp and circumstance.\"",
      "Once the president and first lady depart the White House for the inauguration ceremony, a frenzy of activity begins inside.",
      "The to-do list includes everything from switching out mattresses and bedding to moving furniture, moving boxes, refilling refrigerators, stocking preferred toiletries, doing paint touch-ups and filling closets.",

      "\"There's a moving van that is positioned in one direction to take the belongings of the outgoing president and first family to leave the White House,\" Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, told ABC News eight years ago, on the eve of the first Trump administration. \"And then you have moving vans and trucks that are pulling in from the other side of the driveway on the south side of the White House that will be ready to unload all of the belongings of the new family.\"",
      "No outside movers are hired to execute the move between first families due to security reasons.",
      "Instead, the process is overseen by the White House chief usher, a historically non-political role that, more recently, has changed with new administrations, according to Brower.",
      "\"They're really the general managers of the White House,\" she said, noting that one chief usher, Gary J. Walters, worked in the role for decades, from 1986 to 2007, serving four different presidents.",
      "When Barack Obama became president, he hired a new chief usher, the first woman in the role, and the subsequent Trump and Biden administrations also each hired a new usher versus keeping their predecessor's hire in place, according to Bower.",
      "\"'It's a position held in really high esteem, at least historically it has been inside the White House,\" Brower said. \"You're the boss, and when there's a problem among the 100 staffers, you're the one that's going to hear about it.\"",
      "During the Clinton family's move into the White House in 1993, for example, it was the chief usher who had to deal with finding then-first lady Hillary Clinton's inaugural gown that was lost during the move, according to Brower.",
      "The chief user is also the person who begins to prepare for the Inauguration Day move as far back as when the parties formally nominate their presidential candidate. At that time, according to Brower, the usher starts reaching out to the nominees' inner circles to learn more about their likes and dislikes.",
      "Once a candidate is elected president, the chief usher surveys the president-elect's advance team to get details like their favorite brand of shampoo, preferred pillows and more.",
      "Donald and Melania Trump are unique among first families in that they are returning to the White House after four years away.",
      "Since White House staff members tend to stay in their jobs for decades, many butlers, chefs, housekeepers and more from the Trumps' first term will be working with them again.",
      "\"There's been a four-year break, but he'll be back, and they will know exactly what he wants stocked,\" Brower said. \"I mean, they know everything, so that makes it a lot easier for the staff.\"",

      "For privacy reasons, Patricia asked ABC News to be referred by her first name only.",
      "\"I sent a message to my daughter about what was happening in that moment, and she told me 'get out of there, get out now' but I hadn\u2019t finished my work, so I kept cleaning while they were preparing to leave, and I went downstairs and I started vacuuming while they were packing to go and I thought, 'I should leave too,'\" Patricia said to ABC News in Spanish. \"I went upstairs and told the owner 'I need to leave, I haven\u2019t finished cleaning, I'm sorry, but I feel as though I need to leave' and she said 'Yes, you can leave no problem.'\"",
      "Patricia said that as she began to flee, she saw construction workers and gardeners outside who were still working, and she told them to flee and get to safety, but they didn\u2019t know what to do since they were on the clock. Patricia said she does not know if those workers made it out.",
      "\"The next day, I found out that the house I was in burned down completely, not just the house, but all the streets and the entire block,\" she said.",
      "Patricia said the two houses she worked for burned down, causing her to lose her two main sources of income. The hardship that Patricia now faces is an unfortunate reality for many domestic workers in Los Angeles.",
      "According to Flor Martinez Zaragoza, founder and CEO of Celebration Nation, a non-profit organization that provides support and resources for the Indigenous and Latino community, many domestic workers now face a dire financial hardship because of their employment in areas where structures burned down.",
      "\"A lot of work is not available to them anymore, and unfortunately it's not the best time for that because of the price on food and the way the economy is right now,\" Martinez Zaragoza told ABC News.",
      "Celebration Nation has been collaborating with Immigo, a non-profit immigration services provider that advocates for immigrant rights, by organizing donation and distribution drives on the ground for all victims of the wildfires, but a large focus of their efforts has been towards domestic workers impacted by the fires, especially those who are immigrants.",
      "\"Many domestic workers, believe it or not, a lot of them happen to be undocumented, that's why they take on certain work that others might not want to do ... a lot of times these are jobs that a lot of undocumented folks obtain to be able to feed their families and since they are undocumented, their wages are lower than others,\" Martinez Zaragoza said.",
      "As a result of their immigration status, Martinez Zaragoza also said that these workers often do not qualify for state or federal aid during disasters.",
      "\"Most undocumented families would not be able to get that $700 that the government is providing for everybody else, that\u2019s unfortunately the case here, that's where we step in and that's where we provide food but also other necessities like diapers, deodorant, socks, basic essentials that they don't have to worry about,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for Los Angeles County did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Martinez Zaragoza added: \"We're helping everybody, but we're also paying attention to those that are usually afraid to seek help or just don't know where to get those trusted resources, currently, we're working on providing heavy duty respirator masks and eye goggles to all those domestic workers and volunteers that are picking up the debris from the fires, this specific hazard protection effort is in partnership with organization This Is About Humanity.\"",
      "Jenn Stowe, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, told ABC News that there are over 65,000 domestic workers in LA. The NDWA is a national organization that services and advocates for domestic workers, and they work with more than 70 local and state affiliate organizations throughout the country.",
      "According to data compiled by the NDWA, California has the largest population of domestic workers in the country with more than 350,000 workers in the state. Nationally, more than 9 in 10 domestic workers are women, and over 56% are Black, Hispanic, or AAPI. Domestic workers include roles such as housekeepers, nannies, and caretakers.",
      "Stowe said that in LA, the NDWA has been working closely with Pilipino Workers Center, The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), and Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Popular del Sur de California (IDEPSCA) to provide aid to affected workers. The executive director said that soon after the wildfires broke out, they anticipated that this demographic would be immediately impacted.",
      "\"During points of crises, domestic workers are often the first to lose income, they're often some of the last folks to receive aid, and they're often already working in unsafe working conditions and any sort of devastation or crisis or event like this just exacerbates it,\" Stowe said. \"Our organizations were really worried about the challenges that they might face like getting relief down the road but also more immediately thinking about the lack of income, the lack of PPE, the lack of access to information in the language that they prefer and need.\"",
      "As a result, the NDWA has created the \"We Care: Domestic Worker Relief Fund\" to assist impacted domestic workers. The fund will provide basic supplies, PPE, and long-term recovery support to domestic workers and their families.",
      "\"This is something that was muscle memory for us, we learned during COVID how much the workforce was not protected,\" Stowe said. \"During COVID over 90% of domestic workers didn't have a paid sick day and so we knew that we wanted to set up a fund to be able to really support workers.\"",
      "Despite the available aid, Patricia said she worries about her future and the future of other workers like her. She said it took years to build trust with the homeowners she worked for in Pacific Palisades -- she worked over 30 years for one homeowner -- and since she is in her 60s, she is concerned about starting over again, trying to secure employment, and building trust with new employers.",
      "\"I worry about everyone\u2014not just myself\u2014what are we going to do? I worry about how we will survive,\" Patricia said in Spanish. \"The entire areas that were lost were areas that employed so many of us, it was almost entire cities that burned down, we now have to find other work and limit our expenses.\"",

      "Butler lost his home of 60 years in a fire that decimated the storied Black community of Altadena last week. The fire was one of several fires across Los Angeles that burned more than 14,000 acres, killed 16 and destroyed 7,000 structures.",

      "He added of his last-minute escape, \"Me gettin' away from the fire, it shouldn't have happened.\"",
      "To many, including his four children, Butler is known as \"the heart and soul of Altadena and Pasadena\" for his commitment to the community over the years.",
      "The longtime Altadena resident served as an assistant track and field coach for Pasadena City College and helped lead the team to three consecutive state championships from 1975 to 1977.",
      "Elsewhere in the community, he's helped kids, seniors and more experiencing homelessness. He also owned a sporting goods store, where he said he started giving shoes away because he remembered having holes in his shoes when he was a kid in elementary school.",

      "Garcia, an occupational therapist at a children's hospital, said she was at work on Jan. 7 when Figueroa called and told her their home, which they share with Figueroa's daughter and their two dogs, had lost power. Initially, she didn't think too much about it, because it had happened in the past.",

      "\"When we pulled up to my home, the house next to us, the tree and the back house were on fire. And I was like, 'We can't go in. We can't go in. This is terrifying.'\"",
      "Garcia estimates that her house -- nicknamed the \"Dodger house\" because it was painted blue and white like the Los Angeles Dodgers colors and which Garcia referred to as her \"forever home\" -- caught fire and was gone within six hours.",

      "\"There's so many things to process. I've just found it helpful to list everything and anything just to figure out how to get through every day,\" the expectant mom said. \"When you've lost everything, all you can do is rebuild, and I keep laughing with people and with my family, telling them that we're going to have one hell of a story to tell my baby.\"",

      "The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d by a hair. By the end of Monday's holiday, \u201cMufasa\u201d will have the edge, however.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d cost only $14 million to produce, which it is expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent before their landlord evicts them. Notably it\u2019s the first Black female-led theatrical comedy since \u201cGirls Trip\u201d came out in 2017 and it currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.",

It even beat a brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror \u201cWolf Man,\u201d which debuted in third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters.",
      "Writer-director Leigh Whannell\u2019s monster tale starring Christopher Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don\u2019t generally affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25 million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of Monday\u2019s holiday.",
      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\" was in fourth place with $8.6 million and \u201cDen of Thieves 2\u201d rounded out the top five with $6.6 million.",

      "Billionaire's wealth has grown faster last year, and now the world can expect at least 5 trillionaires within a decade, even as the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990",
      "DAVOS, Switzerland -- Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Joe Biden last week of a \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\u201d The group's sharp-edged report, titled \u201cTakers Not Makers,\u201d also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation \u2014 including his own \u2014 and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\u201d Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about one specific individual. It\u2019s the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\u201d he added.",
      "Like Biden\u2019s call for making billionaires \u201cbegin to pay their fair share\u201d through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam \u2014 a global advocacy group \u2014 called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \u201cdismantle the new aristocracy.\u201d",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \u201cliving wages\u201d to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \u201cbarely changed\u201d since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaire List\u201d as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \u201cminted\u201d every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \u201ccrony connections,\u201d it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \u201cGlobal Risks Report,\u201d which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \u201csocietal polarization\u201d \u2014 a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets. Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday."

      "Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin \u201c seems like a scam,\u201d Trump has embraced digital currencies with a convert\u2019s zeal.

      "Bitcoin is the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency and was created in 2009 as a kind of electronic cash uncontrolled by banks or governments. It and newer forms of cryptocurrencies have moved from the financial fringes to the mainstream in wild fits and starts.",
      "The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies as well as their use by criminals, scammers and rogue nations, has attracted plenty of critics, who say the digital currencies have limited utility and often are just Ponzi schemes.",
      "But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November\u2019s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump's victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000. On Friday, it rose about 5%. It jumped more than $9,000 early Monday, according to CoinDesk.",
      "Two years ago, bitcoin was trading at about $20,000.",

      "Details about the council and its membership are still unclear, but after winning November\u2019s election, Trump named tech executive and venture capitalist David Sacks to be the administration\u2019s crypto \u201cczar.\u201d Trump also announced in late December that former North Carolina congressional candidate Bo Hines will be the executive director of the \u201cPresidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets.\u201d",
      "At last year\u2019s bitcoin conference, Trump told crypto supporters that new regulations \u201cwill be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\u201d Trump's pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto investors and companies chafed as what they said was a hostile Biden administration that went overboard in unfair enforcement actions and accounting policies that have stifled innovation in the industry \u2014 particularly at the hands of outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.",
      "\u201cAs far as general expectations from the Trump Administration, I think one of the best things to bet on is a tone change at the SEC,\u201d said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director of the advocacy group Coin Center.",
      "Gensler, who is set to leave as Trump takes office, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that he\u2019s proud of his office\u2019s actions to police the crypto industry, which he said is \u201crife with bad actors.\u201d",
      "Trump also promised that as president he\u2019ll ensure the U.S. government stockpiles bitcoin, much like it already does with gold.

Critics say bitcoin\u2019s volatility make it a poor choice as a reserve asset.",

      "Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires less than two weeks after deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and ravaged thousands of homes",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires, less than two weeks after the outbreak of deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and charred thousands of homes.",
      "The National Weather Service has issued a warning of a \u201c particularly dangerous situation \u201d for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds. Gusts could peak at 70 mph (113 kph) along the coast and 100 mph (160 kph) in the mountains and foothills.",
      "Windy weather and single-digit humidity are expected to linger through Thursday, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. He said the fire risk is also elevated because the region hasn\u2019t seen rain since April.",
      "Critical fire weather with wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 kph) was also forecast for Southern California communities stretching to San Diego on Monday and Tuesday, with residents urged to take steps to get ready to evacuate such as creating an emergency kit and keeping cars filled with at least a half tank of gas. A windblown dust and ash advisory was also issued, as high winds could disperse ash from existing fire zones across Southern California.",
      "The warnings come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on Jan. 7. The Palisades fire was 52% contained on Sunday and the Eaton fire 81% contained, according to fire officials.",
      "Firefighters have made progress on the perimeter of the Palisades fire, which has blackened more than 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) near the Pacific coast, but there are areas in the interior that continue to burn, said Dan Collins, a spokesperson for the Palisades fire incident.",
      "\u201cThere is always a possibility in a red flag warning something hot, or some type of burning material from the interior, could be perhaps whipped up and blown across the containment lines,\u201d Collins said.",
      "While firefighters are fairly confident the Eaton fire further inland will remain contained, there are concerns a new fire could break out with vegetation especially dry for this time of year, said Carlos Herrera, an Eaton fire spokesperson.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has positioned fire engines, water-dropping aircraft and hand crews across the region to enable a quick response should a new fire break out, according to the governor's office of emergency services.",
      "\u201cThis proactive approach has proven to be a critical component of California\u2019s wildfire response strategy, reducing response times and containing fires before they escalate,\u201d the office said.",
      "Damage estimates have continued to climb for the Palisades and Eaton fires nearly two weeks since they began. Inspectors have fanned out to check buildings and assess damages, but Collins said it is impossible to know whether the remaining structures affected in the Palisades fire are intact.",
      "\u201cOur damage inspection teams have to inspect every structure within the fire perimeter,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey're about two-thirds of the way done.\u201d",
      "Fire officials said they were focused on repopulating evacuated areas, with residents allowed to return Sunday to the hillside area of Pacific Palisades known as the highlands.",
      "Authorities said two people were arrested Saturday while attempting to enter an evacuation zone for the Palisades fire and are being investigated for impersonating firefighters. The pair were wearing turnout gear and claimed to be from an Oregon fire agency, but they weren't, and the truck they were driving had been bought at auction, the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement."

      "\u201cWhen we came in, we inherited partnerships and alliances that were seriously frayed,\u201d Blinken told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The leaders of the Quad countries met with Biden near the U.S. president's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, in September. They agreed to expand the partnership among the four nations\u2019 coast guards to improve interoperability and capabilities, with Indian, Japanese and Australian personnel sailing on U.S. ships in the region.",
      "All the countries are worried about China's increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, and the U.S.-China rivalry is set to intensify after Trump takes office. Beijing has sent Vice President Han Zheng to Trump's inauguration after the U.S. president-elect invited Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but tariffs imposed on Chinese products in Trump's first term were a hallmark of his trade policy, and he has signaled that he will increase and expand them in his second term.",
      "Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone Friday on trade fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said on social media that they agreed to \u201cdo everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, several of Trump\u2019s nominees for key Cabinet positions are known China hawks, including Rubio. Rubio called China \u201cthe most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\u201d during his confirmation hearing Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "Immigrants in Chicago and other U.S. cities have been preparing for immigration arrests since President-elect Donald Trump won the November election",
      "CHICAGO -- The Rev. Homero Sanchez said he didn't realize the depth of fear in the Chicago immigrant community he serves until someone asked him to handle the sale of their family's home and other finances if they are picked up this week when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Immigrants in large cities have been preparing for mass arrests since Trump won election in November, but reports that his initial push would be in the Chicago area has brought a new sense of urgency and fear.",
      "\u201cThey feel they have been targeted for who they are. They feel like they\u2019re reviving this fear they had eight years ago,\u201d said Sanchez of St. Rita of Cascia Parish on Chicago's South Side. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling like something is going to happen. This is not their city because of the threat.\u201d",
      "Sanchez, whose congregation has consisted mostly of people of Mexican descent since the 1980s, devoted Sunday Mass \u201cto solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "Some immigrants in the country without legal status have been designating power of attorney to trusted friends, making plans for childcare in case of separations and installing security cameras on their doors in case immigration agents come. Others have left voluntarily, as Trump aides have encouraged them to do.",
      "Plans for deportation arrests are in flux, but federal immigration officers will target more than 300 people with histories of egregious, violent crimes after Trump takes office Monday, one official said Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public.",
      "The operation will be concentrated in the Chicago area and continue all week, subject to potential weather delays, the official said. Temperatures in Chicago dipped to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14.4 degrees Celsius) with cold temperatures forecast throughout the week.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests a fraction of its targets in such operations, though Trump is expected to cast a wider net than President Joe Biden, whose focus on picking up people away from the border was largely limited to those with serious criminal histories or who pose a risk to national security. Biden's administration also ended the practice of mass worksite arrests, which were common under Trump, including a 2019 operation targeting Mississippi chicken plants.",
      "Trump aides have said they will arrest others, such as spouses or roommates, who are not targets but happen to be in the country illegally.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Saturday that mass deportations remain a top priority. He didn\u2019t give an exact date or city where they\u2019ll start, but he said they would begin soon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll begin very early, very quickly,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t say which cities because things are evolving. And I don\u2019t think we want to say what city. You\u2019ll see it firsthand.\u201d",
      "Sanctuary cities, which limit how local police can cooperate with federal immigration agents, have been one of Trump's favorite targets \u2014 especially Chicago.",
      "The nation\u2019s third-largest city became a so-called sanctuary city in the 1980s and has beefed up its policies multiple times since, including after Trump first took office in 2017. Last week, the City Council heartily rejected a longshot plan calling for exceptions allowing local police to work with ICE agents on deportation cases for people accused or convicted of crimes.",
      "Trump's incoming so-called \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan blasted top Democratic leaders in the state during a visit to the Chicago area last month where he indicated enforcement would start there. But in recent days he told media outlets that plans were evolving.",
      "Homan told Fox News Sunday that Chicago was still on the table but that the new administration was \u201creconsidering when and how we do it.\u201d",
      "An ICE spokesperson referred questions Sunday to the Trump transition team, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plan was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, which said the operation is expected to begin Tuesday.",
      "Community and religious leaders in Chicago said they were disappointed with the potential operation, but ready.",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Sunday on X that his \u201ccommitment to protecting and supporting this city remains unwavering.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Blase Cupich, who leads the Archdiocese of Chicago, spoke out as well.",
      "\u201cThe reports being circulated of planned mass deportations targeting the Chicago area are not only profoundly disturbing but also wound us deeply,\u201d Cupich said Sunday during a visit to Mexico City, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. \u201cWe are proud of our legacy of immigration that continues in our day to renew the city we love.\u201d",
      "Immigrant rights advocates in Chicago rallied Saturday, including Democratic U.S. Reps. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia and Delia Ramirez. They urged immigrants in Chicago to remain calm and exercise their rights, particularly to remain silent and refuse to allow officers into their homes without warrants. Some advocacy groups have planned legal workshops anticipating mass arrests next week.",
      "Ramirez planned to skip Monday's inauguration to post flyers in immigrant-heavy Chicago neighborhoods with information on what to do in case of an encounter with immigration agents.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t let our guard down in Chicago,\u201d Garcia wrote on X.",
      "Carlos, an immigrant from Mexico, has lived in the Chicago area for decades. The 56-year-old doesn\u2019t have legal status to stay in the country but has work authorization in construction and welding. He declined to give his last name and discuss details of his immigration status for fear of being targeted for deportation.",
      "He has three children who have legal status to stay in the country through the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which remains in legal limbo.",
      "Carlos said the family\u2019s contingency planning for deportation includes finding someone to manage their bank accounts, home and car. They\u2019ve also installed a camera on their suburban Chicago home and plan to screen all visitors.",
      "\u201cIf people come to the house, don\u2019t open the door,\u201d he explained. \u201cAsk who it is. Don\u2019t open it unless they have an order.\u201d",

      "When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 on the eve of his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 just before his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town. As the only president in history without prior experience in public office or the military, it was unclear how he would govern.",
      "Not this time.",
      "After four years in the Oval Office, the once and future president returns to power with know-how and a very different team. The political landscape has been transformed, with both chambers of Congress now filled with Republicans beholden to him. He has stocked the Supreme Court and federal courts at all levels. World leaders who were once critics have left the world stage or are more willing to work with him.",
      "Here are some of the ways things have changed:",
      "Trump's first-term agenda was, particularly in its early days, often stymied by the courts and infighting. Many of his Cabinet picks quietly or openly worked to stop his ideas.",
      "But Trump spent four years learning how legislation in passed, how to deal with world leaders and how to maximize the power of the office.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do an even better job because now we have a tremendous amount of experience,\u201d he told reporters at a recent news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, as he reflected on how things had changed.",
      "Trump has often cited his inexperience to explain why he had hired people whom he later regretted for bringing on board.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know the people. I had to rely on people to give me names,\u201d he said during a Turning Point event in 2023. But now, he said, \u201dI know the great ones. I know the smart ones. I know the dumb ones, I know the weak ones, I know the stupid ones.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies have also had four years out of office to lay the groundwork for his return. Long before his formal transition kicked into gear, allied groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the America First Policy Institute were working to draft hundreds of policy papers, executive orders and legislation ready to push on Day 1.",
      "In 2017, the House speaker was Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had pulled his endorsement during the 2016 campaign and later called Trump an \u201c authoritarian narcissist.\" The Senate majority leader was Sen.

      "Ryan did not run for reelection in 2018. McConnell has stepped down as party leader but remains in the Senate. Vocal critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney are gone. Trump's aggressive plays in Republican primaries have created a new generation of members who listen to him. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the new Senate Majority Leader, John Thune of South Dakota, know their power depends, in large part, on Trump's backing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s single-handedly changed the party,\" said Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind. Banks was sworn in as a member of the House as Trump arrived in Washington in 2017, when Banks said, Trump often have to deal with Republican pushback.",
      "Now, \u201ceveryone knows that Donald Trump is calling the shots,\" Banks said. \u201cHe\u2019s the quarterback ... and we\u2019re going to follow his lead and back him up and pass the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected him this time.\u201d",
      "Banks cited the reaction when Trump addressed Senate Republicans in the Capitol while in town for former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral. All the members, including past critics, he said, were on their feet, expressing their support for Trump, his agenda and his Cabinet nominees.",
      "Trump went through half a dozen campaign managers over his first two White House runs and four chiefs of staff during his first term. His White House was known for backbiting and squabbling among competing factions.",
      "Trump's 2024 operation was different. Guided by veteran Florida Republican operative Susie Wiles, the campaign was widely praised by both parties as his most disciplined, professional and competent by far.",
      "Wiles is joining Trump in Washington as his chief of staff. While there are still personality clashes, Wiles has made clear she won't tolerate those who try to hijack the operation.",
      "\"I don\u2019t welcome people who want to work solo or be a star,\u201d Wiles told the news outlet Axios in a recent interview. \u201cMy team and I will not tolerate backbiting, second-guessing inappropriately, or drama. These are counterproductive to the 'mission.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- As he prepares to become the nation's first millennial vice president, JD Vance is already the presumptive heir to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "Vance hasn't been assigned a specific portfolio in the White House like some of his predecessors. While he has long-standing areas of interest, from tech and disaster relief to immigration, people close to the former Ohio senator say he sees his role as doing whatever is needed to best help President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration accomplish his agenda. He is also expected to be a liaison to Capitol Hill, leveraging relationships he built during his two years in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI would say JD\u2019s the guy that will plug any hole or be as beneficial to the administration and be as beneficial to President Trump as possible,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a friend and ally.",
      "Moreno said Vance would also continue the role he played during the campaign as Trump\u2019s chief messenger, defending him on television and jousting with reporters.",
      "\"His most important job is to be out there and be President Trump\u2019s pit bull,\u201d said Moreno. When Trump needs somebody to defend him or his policies, he added, \u201cJD\u2019s going to be the guy that leads the troops to have President Trump\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "It has been an astounding eight years for the 40-year-old \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author, who has transformed himself from a former venture capitalist and harsh Trump critic. Vance will be a critical part not just of Trump's return to the White House but the future of his political movement. With Trump prevented by the Constitution from running in 2028, Vance is a natural successor.",
      "But first, he needs to stay in Trump's good graces.",
      "Trump's decision to tap Vance as his No. 2 landed with a thud at first.",
      "Vance faced a barrage of criticism over his past remarks deriding women who weren't parents as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and for suggesting those without biological children should not be in positions of power. Headlines panned him as the least popular vice presidential candidate in modern history.",
      "But Vance soon delivered a widely praised performance during the vice presidential debate and established himself as a top Trump surrogate, someone who regularly answered reporters' questions and sat for interviews with outlets of all stripes. He once appeared on three Sunday shows in a single day.",
      "Vance's willingness to wade into sometimes hostile territory earned Trump's praise.",
      "\u201cHe is a feisty guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Trump said during his victory speech the night of the election, describing how he had instructed Vance to \u201cgo into the enemy camp.\" While some Republicans might have resisted going on CNN or speaking with The New York Times, Trump said, Vance \"really looks forward to it, and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them.\u201d",
      "Vance, he added, \u201cturned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was \u2014 I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets.\"",
      "Things didn\u2019t go so well for Trump\u2019s last vice president.",
      "Mike Pence, who was unfailingly loyal to his boss, ended his term fleeing from a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, after he refused to go along with Trump\u2019s scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Trump would not forgive Pence, blaming him for their loss, and turned legions of his supporters against his second-in-command. Pence would end his own bid for the 2024 nomination months before the first votes were cast after struggling to raise money or draw significant crowds.",
      "\u201cPence and Trump started off on this same footing, with the same high expectations, and had a great working relationship,\u201d said Devin O\u2019Malley, the vice president\u2019s former press secretary and senior adviser to his campaign. O\u2019Malley stressed that he did not expect things to end up the same way for Vance, whom he said \u201cappears to be hitting all the marks to be successful in the role.\u201d",
      "While Trump and Pence were always said to be close before their split, they had very different personalities. Trump picked Pence, someone he barely knew, in part to assuage evangelical Christians alarmed over Trump's behavior and to win over other Republicans skeptical of his outsider candidacy.",
      "Aides have long described Trump and Vance as real friends who enjoy each other\u2019s company. The two speak almost every day on the phone, in person or by text.",
      "Unlike Pence, Vance is also ideologically aligned with Trump on major issues ranging from trade to the use of U.S. forces overseas. He is close to Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and has developed strong relationships with incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, senior adviser Stephen Miller and others.",
      "He also has ties to the new generation of tech billionaires ascendant in Trump's orbit, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who once employed Vance and backed his rise in politics.",
      "While 2028 is years away, Vance for now is seen by many as the natural torchbearer for the MAGA movement, even as other Republicans with national ambitions circle nearby.",
      "Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller called him \u201cthe future of the Republican Party and this movement that President Trump has started.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really see him as being the person to be the flag bearer going forward, following President Trump,\u201d he said at a recent gathering of business leaders.",
      "When he is sworn in on Monday, Vance will make history as the first millennial to serve in the role and the first vice president in nearly two decades with young children.",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently traveled with Vance to North Carolina to meet with victims of Hurricane Helene. She suggested his relative youth on the national stage gave Vance certain advantages including a comfort with social media and different communication style.",
      "\u201cI think because he is younger he has a boldness that \u2013 with the exception of President Trump \u2013 as you age, your boldness I think becomes shade by lessons learned over the years,\u201d Capito said.",
      "People close to Vance like to stress that he is a regular person \u2014 \u201cabout as normal a guy as there\u2019s ever been in politics,\u201d Moreno said \u2014 with a working-class background.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll wear sweatshirts. He roots for sports teams... He\u2019s a guy\u2019s guy. He\u2019s a bro\u2019s bro,\" said Terry Schilling, president of American Principles Project, who has been advising Vance informally on cultural and family issues since he started running for the Senate. \"He\u2019ll have a beer with you. He'll watch a football game with you. He'll tease you, he\u2019ll rib you. He\u2019s also going to work hard and be serious when he needs to.\u201d",
      "Indeed, after his beloved Ohio State clinched a spot in the national football championship game, Vance took to social media to bemoan his dilemma. The Buckeyes play Notre Dame for the title in Atlanta on Monday night, hours after he and Trump are set to be sworn into office.",
      "\u201cHopefully everyone is cool with me skipping the inauguration so I can go to the national title game,\u201d Vance joked on X, sharing a mock comic strip featuring two red buttons \u2014 \u201cAttend your own inauguration\u201d and \u201cGo watch the Buckeyes win a national title\u201d \u2014 and a sweating superhero torn between them.",
      "It was the kind of quip relatable to any sports fan and the latest burnishing of his regular-guy persona.",

      "The clock starts ticking when the outgoing and incoming presidents leave the White House together for a shared limousine ride to the Capitol for the swearing-in.",
      "\u201cAs soon as they leave, the executive residence staff swings into action,\u201d Matthew Costello, chief education officer of the White House Historical Association, said during a recent online program about Inauguration Day history. \u201cEssentially, staff is working nonstop to inventory, process and move all of the personal items of one first family out and a new first family in.\u201d",
      "After the oath-taking, inaugural address, luncheon and traditional parade, the new president gets to go into the White House to find the family's clothes, furniture and other personal belongings in place and the kitchen stocked with favorite foods.",
      "It's possible that Monday's timeline could be altered after Trump announced that he's moving the inaugural ceremony indoors to the Capitol Rotunda because of approaching bitter cold weather. He's also turning what's typically an hourslong parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House into an indoor version at a pro sports arena.",
      "As the ceremony gets underway, moving trucks for each family that have been on standby nearby will get the all-clear to be waved through tight security to the White House.",
      "The residence staff works in groups. Some will be assigned to pack the Biden family's remaining items while another group loads the boxes onto the designated truck. Other staffers will bring the Trumps' things inside while another group unpacks and puts them where Melania Trump wants them.",
      "The White House is deep-cleaned in between families. Windows will be washed, carpets vacuumed or replaced, new mattresses brought in, and all bedrooms and bathrooms will be stocked with fresh linens and towels.",
      "The process typically starts after the November election when the White House chief usher gets in touch with the president-elect's team to begin coordinating the move.",
      "In November 2016, then-first lady Michelle Obama showed Melania Trump around the living quarters when she accompanied Trump for his Oval Office meeting with then-President Barack Obama.",
      "But after Trump lost reelection in 2020, he broke with tradition and refused to invite then-President-elect Joe Biden to meet. Melania Trump also didn't invite Jill Biden to the residence.",
      "This time around, Trump accepted Biden's invitation to the Oval Office while Melania Trump rejected Jill Biden's offer for them to meet."

      "The president delivered a televised farewell address to the nation on Wednesday.",
      "Back in 2020, Biden saw his campaign flounder after he lost the opening contests in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. But at the fourth stop, South Carolina \u2014 where Black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate \u2014 he was lifted to victory after Clyburn's endorsement.",
      "\u201cI know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,\u201d the congressman said at the time.",

      "\u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,\u201d Biden said in a statement after winning the primary for the second time. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2014 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2014 again.\u201d",
      "It didn't turn out that way. After faltering in a debate against Trump, Biden dropped out of the race under pressure from many Democrats, though Clyburn notably was not among them.",

      "Washington has prepared in unprecedented ways to keep the unfolding events save and secure. But unlike when Trump helped spark a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol and tried to retain power in 2021 after his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, officials are not expecting massive protests, unrest and violence this time. Instead, the city is braced for crowds celebrating Trump's second term and MAGA's total control of the Republican Party.",
      "It is a remarkable turnaround after Trump left the nation\u2019s capital four years in disgrace and skipped the inauguration of his successor. Trump blasted his way through the 2024 GOP presidential primary and won November's election by an Electoral College margin unseen since Democrat Barack Obama was reelected in 2012.",
      "Yet even with that comfortable victory and his party in full, albeit narrow, control of Congress, the incoming president remains one of the most polarizing figures in U.S. history, with nearly as many fierce detractors as ardent supporters.",
      "That means it could be difficult to fulfill postelection pledges about promoting bipartisanship while healing political differences. He told NBC News on Saturday that unity would be a theme of his inauguration speech Monday at the Capitol, along with strength and fairness.",
      "\u201cJanuary 20th cannot come fast enough!,\" he posted on his social media site. \u201cEverybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen.\u201d",
      "Keeping to tradition, Trump spent Saturday night at Blair House, the president's official guest residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, across from the White House. He arrived there after a party at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles west of the city, that illuminated the night sky.",
      "He had arrived in Washington from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, aboard a C-32, the military variant of the Boeing 757, painted in the iconic presidential powder blue and white color scheme. The aircraft that would be known as Air Force One if the president were aboard carried the president-elect as Special Air Mission 47.",
      "Sunday will be Trump's first full day back in the capital since the election. It gives him a chance to enjoy the moment and fire up his core supporters before Inauguration Day's heavy dose of official pomp, including the swearing-in at noon.",
      "Trump planned to place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery before addressing a rally downtown at Capital One Arena, home of Washington pro basketball and hockey teams.",
      "With frigid temperatures expected Monday, Trump directed his oath of office \u2014 now set for the Capitol Rotunda \u2014 and most of Monday\u2019s outdoor events be moved indoors. The traditional parade will be held, in some form, at Capital One Arena.",

    "story": [
      "Baltimore is seeing a sustained reduction in gun violence and city leaders believe investments in robust anti-violence efforts are finally paying off",
      "BALTIMORE -- With his dad in prison and his mom suffering from alcoholism, Malik Grant faced abandonment and instability early on. He got used to people letting him down.",
      "So when outreach workers from a Baltimore anti-violence program offered to help him stay safe and leave the streets behind, he didn\u2019t necessarily have high expectations.",
      "Two years later, Grant has an apartment and a full-time job with the city\u2019s Department of Public Works. He recently started his own business that provides cleaning, landscaping and junk removal services. He plans to hire other young men from his old neighborhood to show them what is possible with hard work.",
      "\u201cI just needed a push,\u201d he said with a smile.",
      "Grant, 29, is among about 200 people receiving support through Baltimore\u2019s relatively new Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which targets the root causes of gun violence: hopelessness, joblessness, poverty, mental health, substance abuse, housing instability, poor conflict resolution and more.",
      "The program uses a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach. Where possible, it offers resources and social services to those most likely to become shooters or victims. But if they stay involved in crime, they face police investigation and potential prosecution, which has led to over 350 arrests since the new strategy launched in January 2022.",
      "The early results are promising.",
      "Baltimore recorded 201 homicides in 2024, the lowest annual total in over a decade, according to police data. It marks a 23% drop from the previous year, a downward trend that began in 2023. Nonfatal shootings also have fallen significantly.",
      "To some extent, the data echoes nationwide trends since many cities saw violence peak during the pandemic. Philadelphia and Detroit are among those recording a recent drop in homicides.",
      "It\u2019s a relief for Baltimore, where gun violence surged after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray exposed an urgent need for police reform. And while other factors almost certainly contributed to the decrease, including changes in policing and strong detective work, city leaders are quick to credit efforts like the Group Violence Reduction Strategy.",
      "The program assigns each participant a life coach to help navigate everything from obtaining a driver\u2019s license and opening a bank account to applying for food stamps, earning a GED, finding stable housing and holding down a job.",
      "That often means leaving behind familiar patterns and embracing the unknown, even when a brighter future seems inaccessible or unlikely, said Sterling Herring with Youth Advocate Programs, which contracts with the city to provide services.",
      "\u201cA lot of our guys won\u2019t know their social security number, but know their jail ID,\u201d Herring said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that we have to change.\u201d",
      "Grant survived a shooting in 2020 that left him hospitalized in a coma. After he connected with Youth Advocate Programs, he was eligible for emergency relocation and spent several months in hotels before moving to his current apartment. It\u2019s the first place he can proudly call home, and he shares the space with his beloved husky-pit bull mix.",
      "After months of receiving rental assistance, he will soon start fully covering the rent on his own.",
      "And Grant\u2019s company recently signed its first contract. He joked that being diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder makes him uniquely suited to run a cleaning business.",
      "\u201cHe turned his childhood trauma into treasure,\u201d life coach Sacha Smith said.",
      "Experts say so-called \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d programs are among the best ways to reduce gun violence, but Baltimore has tried and failed to implement similar strategies in the past.",
      "For them to succeed, participants need a life-changing level of support, which requires dedicated and effective staff with access to sufficient resources. The law enforcement side of the equation requires building strong cases that lead to successful prosecutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to get right,\u201d said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore. \u201cWhat you really want that program to do is change an entire system of how law enforcement works to combat gun violence.\u201d",
      "While praising the city\u2019s recent efforts, Webster also pointed to federal and state legislation to tighten gun laws and a more aggressive approach to prosecuting illegal firearm cases in Baltimore.",
      "Meanwhile, the Baltimore Police Department is undergoing significant court-ordered changes aimed at curbing unconstitutional practices. The agency was placed under a federal consent decree after the Justice Department launched an investigation in the wake of Gray\u2019s death from spinal injuries sustained during police transport.",
      "Homicides spiked around that time and remained elevated for years.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the city is now proving it\u2019s possible to simultaneously reduce violent crime and reform law enforcement. He attributed the success to strong partnerships between city agencies, community groups and law enforcement.",
      "The new anti-violence strategy now operates in four of nine police districts, with plans to expand citywide. Researchers found it was responsible for reducing shootings and homicides by roughly a quarter in the 18 months after it was implemented in the city\u2019s notoriously violent Western District.",
      "Worley said increased community trust and lower caseloads are also helping detectives solve more homicides. Officers are going after the relatively small number of known shooters, rather than conducting large-scale arrests.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, released a five-year plan in 2021 that he hoped would reduce Baltimore gun violence by 15% annually. He created a new office to oversee anti-violence efforts, including the city\u2019s flagship Safe Streets program, which employs conflict mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about really a herculean effort,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore visited Baltimore earlier this month for a news conference about the homicide numbers, praising what he called \u201can \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach.\u201d",
      "But officials also acknowledged the still-staggering loss of life.",
      "Kierra Morrison, whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed on Christmas Eve, attended a candlelight vigil this month in downtown Baltimore to mourn last year\u2019s 201 victims. The city\u2019s recent accomplishments brought her little comfort.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lost for words,\u201d she said.",
      "Morrison said her son had recently been talking about enrolling in a job training program. It made her hopeful he would find a bright future despite recent challenges. If only he\u2019d had more time."

      "The booming solar industry has found an unlikely mascot in sheep as large-scale solar farms crop up across the U.S. and in the fields of Texas",
      "BUCKHOLTS, Texas -- On rural Texas farmland, beneath hundreds of rows of solar panels, a troop of stocky sheep rummage through pasture, casually bumping into one another as they remain committed to a single task: chewing grass.",
      "The booming solar industry has found an unlikely mascot in sheep as large-scale solar farms crop up across the U.S. and in the plain fields of Texas. In Milam County, outside Austin, SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country, capable of generating 900 megawatts of power across 4,000 acres (1,618 hectares).",
      "How do they manage all that grass? With the help of about 3,000 sheep, which are better suited than lawnmowers to fit between small crevices and chew away rain or shine.",
      "The proliferation of sheep on solar farms is part of a broader trend \u2014 solar grazing \u2014 that has exploded alongside the solar industry.",
      "Agrivoltaics, a method using land for both solar energy production and agriculture, is on the rise with more than 60 solar grazing projects in the U.S., according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The American Solar Grazing Association says 27 states engage in the practice.",
      "\u201cThe industry tends to rely on gas-powered mowers, which kind of contradicts the purpose of renewables,\u201d SB Energy asset manager James Hawkins said.",
      "Putting the animals to work on solar fields also provides some help to the sheep and wool market, which has struggled in recent years. The inventory of sheep and lamb in Texas fell to 655,000 in January 2024, a 4% drop from the previous year, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often ideal for livestock grazing, the power plants have been used in coordination with farmers rather than against them.",
      "Sheepherder JR Howard accidentally found himself in the middle of Texas\u2019 burgeoning clean energy transition. In 2021, he and his family began contracting with solar farms \u2014 sites with hundreds of thousands of solar modules \u2014 to use his sheep to eat the grass.",
      "What was once a small business has turned into a full-scale operation with more than 8,000 sheep and 26 employees.",
      "\u201cJust the growth has been kind of crazy for us,\u201d said Howard, who named his company Texas Solar Sheep. \u201cIt\u2019s been great for me and my family.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture experts say Howard's success reflects how solar farms have become a boon for some ranchers.",
      "Reid Redden, a sheep farmer and solar vegetation manager in San Angelo, Texas, said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly scarce.",
      "\u201cSolar grazing is probably the biggest opportunity that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations,\u201d Redden said.",
      "The response to solar grazing has been overwhelmingly positive in rural communities near South Texas solar farms where Redden raises sheep for sites to use, he said.",
      "\u201cI think it softens the blow of the big shock and awe of a big solar farm coming in,\u201d Redden said.",
      "Agrivoltaics itself isn't new. Solar farms are land-intensive and require a lot of space that could be used for food production. Agrivoltaics compensates by allowing the two to coexist, whether growing food or caring for livestock.",
      "There is a lot still unknown about the full effects of solar grazing, said Nuria Gomez-Casanovas, an assistant professor in regenerative system ecology at Texas A&M University.",
      "Not enough studies have been done to know the long-term environmental impacts, such as how viable the soil will be for future agriculture, although Gomez-Casanovas suspects solar grazing may improve sheep productivity because the panels provide shade and can be more cost-efficient than mowing.",
      "\u201cWe really have more questions than answers,\u201d Gomez-Casanovas said. \u201cThere are studies that show that the land productivity is not higher versus solar alone or agriculture alone, so it's context-dependent.\u201d",
      "As one of Texas' largest solar sheep operators, Howard has more clients than he can handle. He expects to add about 20 more employees by the end of this year, which would nearly double his current workforce. As for the sheep, he has enough already.",

      "Now McDaniels, like so many, is facing the gripping realities of grief and questions about what more could have been done. Experts say these survivors are victims themselves; the fires that swept through the Los Angeles area this month were fast-moving and fierce.",

      "She is not quite sure what they could have done. The family thought the ambulance Anthony Mitchell called hours earlier would have arrived in time. Perhaps, had they known it wouldn't, several relatives could have carried her nephew out with sheets, she said.",
      "Her nephew\u2019s younger brother, 33-year-old Jordan Mitchell, lived at home so he could help care for his brother but was hospitalized with sepsis at the time, unable to do anything.",
      "\u201cI very much told myself, I said, \u2018I am my brother\u2019s keeper,\u2019 and I\u2019m proud of that,\" he said, noting that his SUV, which he chose because it fit his father and brother's wheelchairs, survived the flames. \"And I was very protective of him. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be gone this soon. I figured I\u2019d be taking care of him the rest of my life.\u201d"

      "Events honoring Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy and advocating for his vision of a just, nonviolent society will occur the same day as Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States inside the Capitol\u2019s rotunda, he will do so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday commemorating King\u2019s legacy.",
      "It's a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish to fulfill the late reverend's dream of non-violent social revolution.",
      "Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump\u2019s rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third presidential campaign.",
      "But many leaders, including King's own family, see the juxtaposition as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you want to go \u2014 or is this the way you want to go?\u201d said the Rev. Bernice King, the late King\u2019s youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,\u201d King\u2019s daughter said of Trump. \u201cHe has to contend with that legacy on that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the day appropriately in his speech.\u201d",
      "This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is yet to be seen if and how Trump \u2014 who falsely claimed his first inauguration had larger crowds than King's March on Washington \u2014 will acknowledge the day.",
      "\u201cWill he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he's championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) process?\u201d asked Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League civil rights group.",
      "Morial added that Trump's inauguration landing on MLK Day represented \u201ca contradiction of values.\u201d",
      "Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King\u2019s legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored, collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cOur mission doesn\u2019t change. Our job is to make democracy work for all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,\u201d Johnson said. He added that the group \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to assume\u201d the Trump administration can\u2019t be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial justice.",
      "On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged attendees to stay motivated.",
      "\u201cOurs is a journey,\" she said. \u201cWhatever the outcome of any particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be defeated, because when that happens, we won't win.\u201d",
      "Martin Luther King III, the late King's eldest son, prayed with Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called her an advocate who \u201cspeaks to our better angels\u201d and \u201cembodies Dr. King's legacy.\u201d",
      "Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations, vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for what they consider an adversarial administration.",
      "Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local governments and geopolitical tumult.",
      "\u201cThe hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized, active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,\u201d said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding \"there has to be opportunity for everyone.\u201d",
      "King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and social solidarity to see change.",
      "A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book that giving a Black person their \"due\u201d often required \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual merits,\u201d King wrote in the 1967 book, \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.\" \"But this is a day which demands new thinking and the reevaluation of old concepts.\u201d",
      "King's advocacy for \u201cnew concepts\u201d found an heir in the enactment of affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from conservative activists.",
      "Trump's views on race have been criticized for decades. He was found liable for discriminating against Black tenants as a New York realtor in the 1980s. He was instrumental in promoting the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up to November's election has been derided as prejudiced.",
      "As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on 2020 racial reckoning protests.",
      "In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that \u201canti-white racism\u201d now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism against Black Americans.",
      "\u201cI think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can\u2019t be allowed either,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Time magazine.",
      "At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty efforts.",
      "\u201cThis is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,\u201d King wrote. \u201cThere will be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed defeat.\u201d",

      "Two days before Christmas, a group led by President-elect Donald Trump's chief architect of immigration policy wrote to state, county and city officials in so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions to threaten criminal prosecution, jail time and their person...",
      "The ominous letters went to hundreds of state and local officials across the U.S. two days before Christmas. It was a potential blueprint for how the Trump administration may attack \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that resist mass deportations.",
      "They threatened criminal prosecutions and lawsuits going after officials\u2019 personal finances. They invoked RICO, the federal statute often used to fight organized crime.",
      "\u201cYou and your subordinates could potentially face up to 20 years in prison,\u201d America First Legal, a group led by current and former advisors to President-elect Donald Trump, said in the letter. Its president, Stephen Miller, will be deputy chief of policy in the new administration and is a longtime architect of Trump's immigration policies.",
      "The letters\u2019 targets: city, county and state officials in America\u2019s sanctuary jurisdictions, a term rooted in medieval laws that today encompasses a range of protection for immigrants, particularly those living in the U.S. illegally. Sanctuary jurisdictions limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Some targets were chosen for statements they made after Trump\u2019s election. Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, is taken to task for vowing to use \u201cevery tool in the toolbox\u201d to resist mass deportations in her state. But most made the list for refusing to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement by holding people who are wanted for being in the country illegally.",
      "The warnings may signal part of a legal a roadmap for Trump's crackdown on immigration and pledge of mass deportations. It accuses officials of violating several federal statutes, including one against immigrant smuggling and another against interfering with the work of federal officers.",
      "On Saturday, an official said a federal immigration operation concentrated in Chicago will begin after Trump takes office Monday, targeting more than 300 people with histories of violent crimes. Chicago has been a sanctuary city for decades, and officials there have said they retreat on those commitments.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws.",
      "\u201cSanctuary laws don\u2019t shield or harbor or conceal quote-unquote \u2018illegal aliens,\u2019\u201d said Mark Fleming, a lawyer with the Chicago-based National Immigration Justice Center, a pro-immigration group. \"What the laws do is they say \u2019Your role (as federal officials) is to do immigration enforcement. Our role is not, and we\u2019re not going to participate.'\u201d",
      "Immigration lawyers scoffed at the letters\u2019 legal arguments. Police and officials in sanctuary jurisdictions are, they note, enforcing legally enacted laws.",
      "But officials, lawyers and immigration advocates are taking the letters seriously. The involvement of Miller, a senior advisor in Trump\u2019s first term and a major figure in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, means they have no choice.",
      "Plus, many say, the legal arguments may not even be relevant.",
      "\u201cLetters like these are really more about sowing fear than they are about articulating anything that would hold up from a legal standpoint,\u201d said Sirine Shebaya, an attorney and executive director of the National Immigration Project.",
      "It's a fear that can be used against officials and against immigrants themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are hearing a lot of concern from our immigrant community members about whether the city will continue (as a sanctuary) or will they end it,\u201d said Peter Pedemonti, co-director of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the White House tried to use financial cudgels against sanctuary jurisdictions by denying them public safety grants that can be key for law enforcement budgets. Courts largely rejected those attempts, though some Trump loyalists say that could happen again in the incoming administration.",
      "The letters may signal that the cudgels will be legal. They went to well over 200 officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and county officials from Maine, Nebraska and California.",
      "They are largely identical, though occasionally personalized with details of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants in a particular official's jurisdiction.",
      "All are full of dire warnings.",
      "\u201cYou each could face criminal prosecution and civil liability for your illegal acts,\u201d wrote James Rogers, senior counsel for America First Legal Foundation.",
      "\u201cEmployees in your jurisdiction involved in implementing sanctuary policies that prevent federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties would potentially face six years in prison,\" he wrote.",
      "If most lawyers roll their eyes at such threats, they also know that weak legal arguments don\u2019t necessarily stop prosecutions.",
      "\u201cI think these threats are actually a critical cog in the strategy,\u201d said Fleming. \u201cBecause the reality is that even if they lose, they can win by putting someone through this.\u201d",
      "Fear of relentless court cases, particularly in smaller jurisdictions without teams of lawyers, could push officials to ease back on sanctuary laws, or even allow local law enforcement to work with federal immigration officers.",
      "ICE, which has just 21,000 employees, many of them administrators or support personnel, would need immense local law enforcement help to follow through on Trump\u2019s promises of mass deportations",
      "The sanctuary designations have already caused deep divisions in some jurisdictions, with sheriffs in California, Washington and elsewhere vowing to ignore sanctuary policies. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he\u2019s prepared to suspend elected officials if they are \u201cneglecting their duties\u201d under Trump\u2019s promised immigration mandates.",
      "But Democratic leaders including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and New York's Hochul vowed after Trump's election that they would stand firm on their sanctuary policies.",
      "A few days after the election, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson insisted that the city's police force would not help ICE agents with deportations.",
      "\u201cWe will not bend or break,\u201d Johnson told reporters.",
      "The question is whether sanctuary officials will continue to stand firm in the face of personal legal threats and an incoming White House that has made clear immigration is a top focus.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller is going to be the deputy chief adviser to the president,\" said R. Linus Chan, an attorney who works with immigrants detained by ICE, and a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cSo you can\u2019t really just ignore him.\u201d"

      "Flooded cornfields near the Tennessee River in northern Alabama are a paradise for birders who flock to see tens of thousands of migrating sandhill cranes every winter",
      "DECATUR, Ala. -- In flooded agricultural fields near the Tennessee River, tens of thousands of sandhill cranes stand tall among broken corn stalks and shallow water searching for corn, berries, seeds and insects.",
      "The sound and sight of so many cranes clustered together creates a chorus of trills, trumpets and honks throughout the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge Center in northern Alabama during the winter.",
      "The annual migration of sandhill cranes brings bird-watchers in droves to see the tall birds up close, but also the chance to catch a glimpse of the rare and endangered whooping cranes that migrate in much smaller numbers to Wheeler. Alongside the cranes, plenty of other birds can be spotted at Wheeler, including geese, ducks, bald eagles, kestrels and hawks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a birder\u2019s paradise,\u201d park ranger David Young noted.",
      "The cranes, with their distinctive red foreheads and gray feathers, fly to Alabama from the Great Lakes annually. The sandhill cranes started staying overwinter at Wheeler starting in the mid-1990s and the numbers increased dramatically in the mid-2000s, Young said. Last year, the sandhill population that wintered at Wheeler reached a new record of 30,000 cranes.",
      "\u201cHere in the Tennessee Valley, we have three things that these cranes need,\u201d Young said. \"The wide open fields here around our visitor center. The leftover crop and the natural foods that they like to forage on in those fields. And then open mudflats and shallow water on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.\u201d",
      "The refuge has become a hotspot for birders to break out the binoculars and even get closer to the 4-foot (1.2-meter) tall cranes as visitors stay hidden behind photography blinds and a two-level observation center. An annual Festival of the Cranes in January brings more attention and visitors.",
      "The cranes put on an impressive show, dancing on their slender legs, flapping their wings and sticking their long beaks in the air to vocalize with purring and squawks as they socialize.",
      "Diana Maybury-Sharp, from Birmingham, regularly comes to Wheeler with friends to hike and look at birds.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty extraordinary. I've seen them in other parts of the country where there were just a few,\u201d Maybury-Sharp said. \u201cThey're not vocal like they are here. There's so many here that it's an unusual experience.\u201d",
      "The whooping cranes, part of the eastern migratory population that comes from Wisconsin, started migrating to Alabama in 2004 and their population is about between 12 and 20 each winter, said Young.",
      "Whooping cranes were nearly wiped out in the early 1900s by hunters and loss of habitat from farming. Recovery and reintroduction efforts have slowly increased their wild and captive populations to more than 800, according to the International Crane Foundation.",
      "Migratory whooping cranes depend on freshwater wetland habitats in Texas and the southeast, which could be affected by rising sea levels and droughts, according to the foundation.",
      "They are sometimes hard to spot amongst the shorter crowd of sandhills, but their height and white feathers help them stand out. Young said the migration patterns of the cranes may change depending on the climate trends of both their nesting locations and their winter homes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how long they will continue to winter here in north Alabama,\" Young said. \"And maybe they may not need to come this far south in the future. But for now, we\u2019re really enjoying their presence and making sure to provide that habitat for them and the opportunity for people to view them here too.\u201d",
      "Rob Broeren, of Huntsville, brought along his telephoto lens and camera and found a good spot to practice his wildlife photography hobby. He comes to the refuge about a dozen times each year to photograph the birds and ducks.",
      "\u201cYou just need to be patient and wait for them to do something interesting and make their calls,\u201d Broeren said. \u201cYou get that cool shot and that's a good day.\u201d",
      "Broeren was scouting locations for friends coming in from out of town who wanted a chance to see the rarest of cranes.",
      "\u201cBirders are big on a checklist of seeing lots of different birds,\" Broeren said. \u201cAnd so people that haven\u2019t seen that species because it is quite rare are willing to drive kind of a long way if they think they have a good shot of seeing it.\u201d",
      "The sandhill cranes will start leaving the refuge in mid-February. Young said he notices a lot more agitation and activity when the birds are signaling they are ready to make the journey back to their nesting grounds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually on a day when we have some sort of a south wind,\" Young said. \"They\u2019re smart and they will ride the wind back to their breeding grounds whenever it\u2019s most convenient for them.\u201d"

Linda Thomas-Greenfield is warning that if it happens again during Trump's second term, adversaries will move in anew.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Thomas-Greenfield said during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, the United States again engaged with the world, rebuilt alliances and reestablished America\u2019s leadership.",
      "\u201cThat is the gift that we hand over to the next administration,\u201d she said, \u201cand I hope that they will accept that gift in the spirit in which it is being given to them.\u201d",
      "In a brief meeting with Trump\u2019s nominee, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, Thomas-Greenfield told her \u201cthat the U.N. is important, and that it is important that we not cede any space to our adversaries.\u201d",
      "Those rivals \u201cwill change the rules of the road,\" she warned. \"And so, U.S. leadership is extraordinarily important.\u201d",
      "In his first term, Trump called the United Nations \u201cjust a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\u201d He suspended funding to its health and family planning agencies and withdrew from its cultural and education organization UNESCO and top human rights body. That's raised uncertainty about what's ahead, especially because the United States is the U.N.'s biggest single donor.",
      "Stefanik has called for a \u201ccomplete reassessment\" of U.S. funding for the 193-nation world body, described the U.N. as a \u201cden of antisemitism\u201d and urged a continued halt to support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.",
      "Of course, the U.N. isn\u2019t perfect and needs reforms, Thomas-Greenfield said.",
      "But to those who criticize the U.N. as a big bureaucracy where little gets done or decisions are ignored, she said she always quotes the late former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright, who said \u201cif it didn\u2019t exist, we would invent it.\u201d",
      "Thomas-Greenfield stressed the U.N.\u2019s importance in dealing with major global issues, from war to humanitarian aid and the need to regulate artificial intelligence.",
      "The United States must stay at the table, she said, \u201cso that we can have influence and work with the entire system to ensure that the system delivers to the world.\u201d",
      "The most important table is the horseshoe-shaped one for the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful U.N. body, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security.",
      "Thomas-Greenfield said she gave Stefanik the same advice she got \u2014 to meet quickly with all of them \u2014 including permanent members Russia and China, rivals with veto power.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s going to be sitting around the table with them on almost a daily basis,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to know the individuals you are going to have to engage with, whether they are friends or foes.\u201d",
      "In her final emotional speech to the Security Council, Thomas-Greenfield focused on Sudan, saying she wished there was closure on one crisis the world faces \u2014 ticking off Gaza, Ukraine, Congo and other hotspots.",
      "She told AP the U.N. and the world \u201chave to be more proactive in our engagement\u201d to try to end these conflicts.",
      "Sudan, where nearly two years of fighting has created famine and the world\u2019s worst displacement crisis, is an example \u201cof where as an international community, we could have done more sooner and ended the suffering sooner.\u201d",
      "Thomas-Greenfield, now 72, started her career as an academic and lived in Liberia, where she first saw U.S. diplomats at work and decided to join the Foreign Service in 1982.",
      "She spent much of her more than 40-year career in Africa, returning to Liberia as ambassador, and rose to be assistant secretary of state for African affairs from 2013 to 2017, when Trump took office.",
      "Biden brought her out of retirement to become U.N. ambassador and a member of his Cabinet.",
      "At the United Nations, she said she\u2019s gained a much broader perspective on Africa\u2019s important place in the world and urged recognition of its immense resources \u2014 its people.",

      "The two states recognize King and Lee on the third Monday in January. Their state governments created holidays more than a century ago to honor Lee and later combined the day with the federal holiday established in the 1980s to honor King.",
      "The strange juxtaposition of honoring men from vastly different legacies has persisted for decades.",
      "Both men have January birthdays. Lee was born Jan. 19, 1807. King was born Jan. 15, 1929.",
      "In the years after the Civil War, white politicians in southern states created multiple holidays to honor Confederate leaders and dead Confederate soldiers. Alabama lawmakers in 1901 named a January state holiday for Lee. Mississippi did the same in 1910.",
      "President Ronald Reagan in 1983 signed legislation naming the third Monday of January as Martin Luther King Jr. Day to honor the slain civil rights leader. States slowly added the day to their roster of state holidays. Alabama and Mississippi in the 1980s adopted Martin Luther King Day as a state holiday, adding it to their existing day honoring Lee.",
      "Some other southern states at one time also had a joint holiday, but have ended that practice, leaving only Alabama and Mississippi with a single day honoring both King and Lee.",
      "Black lawmakers in Alabama and Mississippi have made multiple attempts in recent years to separate the holidays. But they have so far been unsuccessful.",
      "Rep. Kenyatt\u00e9 Hassell said he wants to try again in Alabama in the legislative session begining next month.

      "In Mississippi, Rep. Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, introduced legislation this session that would remove the recognition of Lee from the holiday.

    "summary": "Lord Rose says it harms productivity but expert says hybrid work can be as good as full-time in the office.",
    "story": [
      "Working from home is creating a generation who are \"not doing proper work\", the former boss of Marks and Spencer and Asda has warned.",
      "Lord Rose told BBC Panorama that home working was part of the UK economy's \"general decline\" and employees' productivity was suffering.",
      "His comments come as some companies are calling time on remote working. Amazon, Boots and JP Morgan are just some of the businesses who now require their head office staff to be in every day.",
      "However, work-from-home expert Prof Nicholas Bloom said that while fully remote work can be \"quite damaging\" to some workers' productivity, spending three days out of five in the office was as productive as fully office-based work overall.",
      "Lord Rose, who was chief executive of M&S and recently stepped down as the chairman of Asda, said: \"We have regressed in this country in terms of working practices, productivity and in terms of the country's wellbeing, I think, by 20 years in the last four.\"",
      "In a December 2024 UK snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics, 26% of people said they had been hybrid-working in the prior seven days, with some days in the office and some days at home - while 13% had been fully remote and 41% had been fully office-based (the remainder were not working at the time).",
      "The shift to working from home has transformed local economies. Industry estimates indicate that vacant office space has nearly doubled since the pandemic, a quarter of dry-cleaning businesses have shut down, and the number of golf games played during the working week has risen 350% - suggesting some people are mixing work and pleasure.",
      "Working from home is rapidly becoming a major battleground in the culture wars. The government is currently legislating to strengthen the right of employees across the UK to request working from home and says that it intends to make it harder for employers to turn down requests.",
      "But some employers - including government bodies - are battling with staff to get them back into the office, arguing that face-to-face interaction is essential to collaborative working.",
      "In some cases, such as independent record label Hospital Records, this requires negotiation between a young workforce - some of whom may never have worked full-time in an office - and their older bosses.",
      "Company founder Chris Goss, who introduced a new policy requiring staff work three days in the office rather than two, said he had \"a nagging feeling\" that remote working has affected the company's bottom line.",
      "\"I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships, and so the one single way for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person.\"",
      "Maya, a 25-year-old marketing manager at the company, said she likes being around her more experienced colleagues in the workplace. \"There's a lot of people in my team that are a lot further along in their career, so if I need help with something, you know, I can just ask someone.\"",
      "But she believes she would not be able to be in the office five days a week \"because my social battery drains and I need sometimes to be just at home and just to smash out loads of admin\".",
      "Prof Bloom, a Stanford University economist, said his research into working from home suggests employees in their teens and early 20s should probably be in the office at least four days a week to maximise their opportunities for being mentored.",
      "However, he said polls of tens of thousands of employees in the UK, US and Europe suggest workers valued the ability to work from home for two days a week about as much as an 8% pay rise.",
      "Employment rights minister Justin Madders told Panorama there was a growing body of evidence that working from home was more productive. He also said it was good for growth because companies will have \"a much more motivated workforce\" and \"if we're able to get more people into work because flexibility is available for them, that will help us reach our growth ambitions\".",
      "Prof Bloom may not be as optimistic about the effect hybrid working has on productivity, but he does agree that increasing the number of roles which can be done from home could help with economic growth if it encourages more people back into work, such as those with caring responsibilities.",
      "\"That is a huge boost\" and \"kind of a win, win, win\", because people would be able to work in better conditions, contribute to tax revenue and \"everyone gains\".",
      "One of the people who could benefit is Harleen, who was made redundant after she had her second child and has been unable to return to work because she cannot find a fully remote role that fits around her autistic son's routine.",
      "\"I am not seeing those jobs advertised. I'm not seeing anything that caters to that flexibility,\" she said.",
      "\"Every day I wake up and I'm thinking I'm living in Groundhog Day. All I'm doing is being a mother. I enjoy being a mum, but I want productivity. I start to feel like I'm just being brain dead.\"",
      "In the public sector, productivity is the lowest it has been since 1997 - except for the pandemic lockdown years - and some blame working from home. Since November 2023, civil servants have been called back in for between two to three days a week.",
      "But in several public bodies, including at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in Newport, South Wales, some staff are refusing to return.",
      "Ed, an IT delivery manager at the ONS and a rep for the PCS trade union, said he has worked almost entirely from home since the pandemic. He says it helps him to get his children to school and nursery and not waste time on commuting.",
      "\"We've never been told by senior leaders at the ONS that there is a problem with productivity, there's a problem with quality, there's a problem with meeting deadlines,\" he said.",
      "\"We will never see this opportunity again. We have to fight for workers' rights.\"",
      "He and other union members are threatening to strike if they are forced to travel into the office 40% of the time. Civilian staff in the Metropolitan Police and union members at the Land Registry are also in dispute over policies on returning to the office.",
      "The ONS, which is in talks with the union, says it believes \"face-to-face interaction\" helps to \"build working relationships, supports collaboration, and innovation\".",
      "But whatever the outcome of disputes such as this, it is clear that all of us working full-time in the office is now a thing of the past."

      "Incoming President Trump has indicated though that he is opposed to the ban and will find a way to reverse it.",
      "If the US ban goes ahead, experts point to the previous ousting of Chinese and Russian tech companies on national security grounds as a potential blueprint for how the TikTok ban might spread around the world.",
      "\"There are big parallels between TikTok and what happened with China's Huawei and Russia's Kaspersky that indicates it's just a matter of time until a creeping ban takes affect,\" says Emily Taylor, Editor of the Cyber Policy Journal.",
      "In both cases these companies were accused by the US of being a threat to national security - but no smoking gun was ever revealed by cyber security authorities.",
      "The same has happened with TikTok.",
      "Under President Trump, Kaspersky's flagship antivirus software product was banned from civil and military computers in the US after accusations arose in 2017 that it was used by the Kremlin in a hacking incident that was never proven.",
      "The UK followed almost immediately and one by one other allies fell into line with restrictions, warnings or bans.",
      "It took years but eventually a countrywide ban took effect last year in the US but it was all but redundant by then. Kaspersky closed its US operations followed by its UK offices saying there is no viable business there.",
      "The company has always argued that the US government based its decision on the \"geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns\" rather than independently verifying risk.",
      "According to research from Bitsight Kaspersky's decline in usage after the ban was pronounced, not just in the US but in at least 25 other countries too, even those with no overt public policy to ban the software.",
      "Almost the exact same thing happened with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.",
      "The US accused Huawei and other Chinese tech firms of being too close to the Chinese government. It argued that the company's popular 5G kit should not be used to build telecoms in case it could be used to spy on or degrade communications.",
      "A former Huawei UK member of staff said that once the US decided to ban, block or restrict Huawei it became almost inevitable that allies would follow.",
      "\"The UK and others spoke about independently coming to their own conclusions over security but the US was unrelenting in its lobbying behind closed doors. They warned about the national security risks which were never backed up by evidence,\" said the former insider, who didn't want to be named.",

      "Ciaran Martin, who was head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre during the bans on Huawei and Kaspersky, agrees that generally when the US makes a national security or strategic decision about a company, the UK and allies eventually follow suit.",
      "However, as with everything else to do with TikTok, he says there is a huge caveat in the form of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"What we don't yet know is whether TikTok will be the exception as Trump has said he is opposed to the ban so will he order allies to replicate a ban? We don't yet know.\"",
      "Trump's position on TikTok has changed dramatically since his first presidency when he tried to get it banned. Since then he has become a supporter after his re-election campaign gained support through TikTok videos.",
      "Emily Taylor agrees that this unknown factor might make TikTok different to Huawei and Kaspersky.",
      "\"It depends on how much pressure the administration is willing to exert\", she told the BBC.",
      "\"If their foreign policy agenda is packed then forcing other allies to follow the ban might fall down the list and allow countries to wait it out\".",
      "At the moment, there are \"no plans\" for a TikTok ban in the UK, a government spokesperson said on Saturday. \"We engage with all major social media companies to understand their plans for ensuring the security of UK data and to ensure they meet the high data protection and cyber security standards we expect.\"",
      "Meanwhile, UK government minister Darren Jones told the BBC on Sunday: \"We won't be following the same path as the Americans unless or until... there is a threat that we are concerned about in the British interest, and then of course we will keep it under review.\"",
      "The app was banned from the UK Parliament in 2023 over security concerns.",
      "But Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that \"for consumers who want to post videos of their cats dancing, that doesn't seem like a security threat to me\".",
      "The West - and the rest",
      "Another aspect to consider about TikTok's future post-US ban is whether or not the app can continue to thrive without a US customer base.",
      "Any app that loses 170m users would suffer but US users in particular are valuable for creators, advertisers and direct spending in TikTok Shop.",
      "If the rest of the West follows it will reduce the money flowing into the company and curtail development of new features, further entrenching the dominance of US platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Snapchat.",
      "TikTok is already banned in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India too - a massive market. It has no presence in China because of its sister app Douyin.",
      "Kaspersky and Huawei both managed to weather their storms by relying on home-grown customer bases and by pivoting to regions like Africa and the Middle East.",
      "So it might be possible for TikTok to build its user bases here. But if the US ban creeps around the world then the app will likely never be as big as it currently is and may well wither and die a slow death."

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",
      "The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected.",

      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",

      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",

      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",

      "When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310. Cards were generally used in this way in place of small change when buying snacks, papers and occasional groceries.",
      "The limit was raised gradually, to \u00a320 in 2012, then to \u00a330 in 2015, before going up to \u00a3100 in October 2021.",
      "Both ideas would be designed to encourage spending but could also be inflationary.  They would need to go through reviews and consultation, so are unlikely to be imminent changes, even if approved.",

    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Winconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",

      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",

      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "Chappell Roan can't be stopped.",
      "Over the last 12 months, the 26-year-old has become the buzziest star in pop. A flamboyant, flame-haired sensation, whose songs are as colourful as they are raw.",
      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",
      "Success has been all the sweeter because her former record label refused to release many of the songs that exploded onto the charts last year.",

      "The 26-year-old is the first female pop star to achieve mainstream success as an openly queer person, rather than coming out as part of their post-fame narrative.",
      "On a more personal level, she's finally got the financial security to move into a house of her own, and acquire a rescue cat, named Cherub Lou.",
      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

      "Unless there is a sudden and staggering plot twist, Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids for allegedly unlawfully intruding into his life reaches its most important moment on Tuesday when his claims against The Sun and the long-closed News of the World, come to trial.",
      "The plot twist would be a settlement of his mammoth case against their parent, News Group Newspapers [NGN], the British press arm of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Is it likely? You would get better odds on Harry and Meghan announcing a weekly lifestyle column for The Sun on Sunday.",
      "This will be the first time that News Group Newspapers has had to defend itself against allegations that its journalists and executives across the whole organisation were involved in or knew about unlawful newsgathering techniques.",
      "If it were to lose, and lose badly, a finding from the court of corporate-level wrongdoing would be in stark contrast to a longstanding defence that phone hacking was limited to bad apples in one now-closed title.",
      "The prince's allegations of tabloid wrongdoing date back to 1996. Harry and his brother Prince William first became aware they may have been targeted in 2006.",
      "Back then, texting was still in its infancy and everybody left voicemails - and some tabloid journalists realised it was rather easy to listen in.",
      "Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were arrested, and later jailed, for intercepting voicemails on phones belonging to the princes' aides.",
      "Prince Harry says as the scandal deepened, he held on for NGN to settle Royal Family claims under a \"secret agreement\" to avoid embarrassment in court. NGN's lawyers have said this is \"Alice in Wonderland stuff\" - and the court has ruled it hasn't seen evidence of such a backroom deal.",
      "All these years on, the Duke of Sussex seems in no mood to give up on what has become a crusade against tabloid journalism. And so his case is going ahead - and what happens over the next two months may define both the prince's legacy and the future of a British journalism institution.",
      "NGN long ago apologised for unlawful practices at the News of the World and closed it down in 2011. It denies similar claims against The Sun - and the duke's wider allegation of a corporate-wide cover-up.",
      "It has settled cases brought by some 1,300 claimants, to the tune of around \u00a31bn including legal costs.",
      "That means it has seen off potential trials from people who say the newspapers ran stories that could have only been written with access to private or confidential sources of information that could not have been publicly known.",
      "Those settlements left just two claimants - one of them Prince Harry.",
      "When he launched his claim, he alleged that more than 200 articles published by NGN between 1996 and 2011 contained information gathered by illegal means. The trial will look at a sample of around 30 stories in detail.",
      "Some of those will cover ground trodden in his successful Mirror Group case in 2023 and, just like in that case, he will give evidence in person.",
      "There will be hours of analysis of how the Sun got scoops such as \"Emotional Harry rang Chelsy at midnight\" - a story it ran almost twenty years ago to the day about his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.",
      "There will be further separate allegations from the second claimant, Lord (Tom) Watson. The former Labour MP says his phone was targeted around the time he was investigating the Murdoch newspapers at the height of the scandal almost 15 years ago.",
      "Mr Justice Fancourt will decide if any of the NGN articles were the product of unlawful information gathering, such as information tricked or \"blagged\" out of phone companies by private investigators.",
      "In Prince Harry's case, he will not rule on whether there was any phone hacking because Prince Harry ran out of legal time to bring those allegations to trial.",
      "None of this is going to be simple in court.",
      "The judge had repeatedly expressed his frustration, referring to the two sides as entrenched well-resourced armies refusing to give any ground to each other.",
      "And at no stage has Prince Harry looked like he was going to settle, despite the enormous financial hit he faces by not doing so.",
      "If a claimant turns down an offer of settlement and is later awarded less in damages by a judge, they have to pay the legal costs of both sides.",
      "Prince Harry has been very open about the hit he will take and why he was pressing ahead.",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" he told an audience at a New York Times event in December.",
      "News Group has, in simple terms, three lines of defence. It will firstly argue that Harry has run out of time to bring allegations of unlawful information gathering.",
      "This saw off his mobile phone hacking claim.",
      "Secondly, its lawyers will test, article-by-article, the duke's claims that the information in them came from dodgy sources.",
      "Thirdly, News Group has lined up witnesses to rebut Prince Harry and Lord Watson's broader allegation that the top brass knew what was going on and were party to the mass destruction of purportedly incriminating records in 2011.",
      "While the celebrity focus will inevitably be on the prince when he goes into the witness box, that third allegation of a cover up is the most important element of this trial.",
      "While the hit to Prince Harry's wallet will be big, the damage to NGN's reputation - and that of its executives - would be greater still if the court finds they were involved.",
      "The executives the claimants will accuse of wrongdoing include the current CEO, Rebekah Brooks. She was found not guilty of conspiracy to hack voicemails in the seismic 2014 trial that ended with the jailing of Andy Coulson, her former colleague, News of the World editor and David Cameron's communications chief.",
      "Another is Will Lewis. He played a key role in managing the hacking crisis in 2011. He is now the CEO of the Washington Post - an appointment that has been opposed by many at the newspaper because of this association.",
      "They and others deny wrongdoing.",
      "Will they be giving evidence? A spokesperson for NGN said: \"Both claimants allege unlawful destruction of emails by News International between 2010-2011. This allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied. NGN will be calling a number of witnesses including technologists, lawyers and senior staff to defeat the claim.\"",
      "Exactly what evidence Prince Harry brings to prove this claim - and what NGN says in defence - may define the entire battle.",
      "Tuesday really is the beginning of the end. And someone is going to lose - and lose big."

      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dame Joan Plowright, who has died aged 95, was one of Britain's finest stage actresses - and later found fame on the cinema screen, although she largely preferred stage work.",
      "The Tony and Golden Globe winner once said movies were a fall-back to pay the bills, remarking: \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "Theatre audiences enjoyed her versatility and good humour, and her 1961 Tony-winning Broadway role A Taste of Honey saw her play a troubled teenager, with Angela Lansbury as her mother.",
      "Other notable stage roles include Saint Joan in 1963 and Saturday, Sunday, Monday a decade later, along with films including 1992's Enchanted April and Tea with Mussolini in 1999.",
      "She was also married to acting great Sir Laurence Olivier for 28 years, until his death in 1989.",
      "After he died, Plowright continued to act into her 80s, until failing sight forced her retirement.",
      "Joan Ann Plowright was born on 29 October 1929 in Brigg, Lincolnshire.",
      "Her mother, Daisy, was a keen amateur actor and by the age of three, her daughter had taken to the stage.",
      "She went to Scunthorpe Grammar School before studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic.",
      "Her mother encouraged her choice of career, albeit with brutal candour.",
      "\"You're no oil painting,\" said Daisy, \"but you've got the spark. Just thank God you've got my legs, and not your father's.\"",
      "She made her stage debut as a professional actress in Croydon in 1948, and by 1956 she had joined the Royal Court theatre in London.",
      "At the time, the Royal Court was a hotbed of new talent, specialising in controversial works. It was also the spiritual birthplace of the kitchen-sink drama.",
      "Plowright gained recognition in a series of productions penned by this group of Angry Young Men, in roles that relied on acting ability rather than mere glamour.",
      "As the daughter of a Lincolnshire newspaper editor, she was far from working-class - but her down-to-earthiness and emotional honesty helped bring British theatre up to date.",
      "In 1957, she co-starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in a production of John Osborne's play The Entertainer.",
      "Olivier, who was playing Archie Rice, was at the peak of his acting career and considered something of a matinee idol.",
      "Plowright played his daughter, and the actors' mutual respect led to romance. \"Nothing is so sexy in a man as talent,\" she observed.",
      "She was initially cautious about a relationship with him - Olivier was 22 years older and already one half of Britain's most celebrated theatrical couple, married to Vivien Leigh.",
      "Plowright herself was married to fellow actor Roger Gage.",
      "But Leigh, Sir Laurence's second wife, who was troubled by mental illness,  divorced him in 1960.",
      "Plowright and her husband divorced the same year.",
      "A year later, Olivier married Plowright in Connecticut - around the same time she won a Tony award on Broadway for her role in A Taste of Honey.",
      "The couple were soon appearing together in a series of plays in Chichester, West Sussex, including a notable staging of Uncle Vanya.",
      "The Guardian's Michael Billington called it \"one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th Century\" and that it \"brought tears to my eyes\".",
      "They went on to have three children, but their marriage was not without its difficulties.",
      "\"He has extremes of behaviour, which you understand,\" she later said. \"You just find a way not to be swept overboard by his demons.\"",
      "Their relationship also led her to refuse for five years to appear at the National Theatre, where her husband was director from 1962\u20131973.",
      "The actress felt  she would have been vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.",
      "Eventually though, she took a contract with the theatre for a decade, in far grander roles than those at the Royal Court.",
      "By now, her husband had been elevated to the peerage - which made her Lady Olivier - but she didn't use the title.",
      "Plowright won a Golden Globe and was Oscar-nominated for her appearance in the 1991 film Enchanted April.",
      "In fact, she won two Golden Globes in one year - the other coming for HBO TV movie Stalin.",
      "Her other films included Three Sisters in 1970 and The Merchant of Venice in 1973 - both opposite her husband and both based on National Theatre productions.",
      "She also played Mrs Fairfax in 1996's Jane Eyre, and her range went far beyond the classics in films like Dennis the Menace, Last Action Hero and 101 Dalmatians.",
      "She also took a role in the 1990 black comedy I Love You to Death, with Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman.",
      "In 1989, Lord Olivier died of kidney failure , at the age of 82.",

      "Dame Joan found work a great solace following her husband's death, appearing in a dozen films between 2000 and 2010.",
      "They included 2003's I Am David, about a boy who escapes a gulag in Bulgaria, and the comedy Bringing Down the House, starring Steve Martin, from the same year.",
      "However, she clearly saw the silver screen as a poor cousin of the theatre.",
      "\"One can't pretend that most film dialogue is all that challenging,\" she said. \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "As if in agreement, the theatre in her native Scunthorpe renamed itself in her honour.",
      "Her chief obstacle to more theatre work was her eyesight - she had macular degeneration, which made the stage increasingly difficult. In 2014, it forced her retirement from all types of acting.",
      "Four years later, she appeared alongside three old friends - Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Judi Dench - in a BBC Arena film, Nothing Like a Dame.",
      "The grandes dames of British theatre reminisced about their lives and careers, with searing honesty and humility.",
      "Filmed in the garden of the home she had shared with Olivier, Dame Joan spoke candidly about how she had tried to avoid playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre, feeling that she would be mocked for her lack of beauty.",

    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",
      "As Mike Muncer told BBC Arts' Inside Cinema: \"Lynch lures us in with the promise of familiar, traditional genre thrills and mysteries as a safety net, before that weirdness starts to creep in.",
      "\"Eventually, the mystery box is opened, revealing the darker, more sinister story that Lynch has actually been telling us all along.\"",
      "Cult icon",
      "In his latter years Lynch enjoyed revered cult status. In 2017, he directed Twin Peaks: The Return, a new series set 25 years after the events of the original show, with much of the same cast.",
      "At the same time, the show's legacy continues to endure, inspiring dramas like True Detective and 2023's critically acclaimed Playstation survival horror game Alan Wake II.",
      "Away from the camera, Lynch admitted he had sometimes struggled to balance the \"tricky business\" of fatherhood with his career.",
      "He welcomed four children - Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula - with ex-wives Peggy Reavey, Mary Fisk and Mary Sweeney, and estranged wife Emily Stofle.",
      "\"I love all my children and we get along great, but in the early years, before you can have a relationship of talking to them, it's tough,\" he told Vulture. \"The work is the main thing, and I know I've caused suffering because of that. But at the same time I have huge love for the kids.\"",
      "Although Lynch never did return to feature film directing to give himself another shot at an elusive Oscar win, he was granted an honorary lifetime achievement statuette by the Academy in 2019. He also made a cameo in Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical 2022 film, The Fablemans, playing filmmaker John Ford.",
      "His artistic pursuits increasingly diversified toward the end of his life, from his original passion for painting to music. Just last year, he released Cellophane Memories, an album with Chrystabell. This added to his previous work producing music videos for artists like Moby and Nine Inch Nails.",

    "title": "BBC hopes new Match of the Day hosts are a winning team",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:56:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan have been announced as the three new presenters of the show.",
    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",
      "The person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.",
      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",
      "When Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).",
      "Angus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.",
      "The One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.",
      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",
      "Given that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.",
      "There is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.",
      "It is a shop window that helps keep top flight football central to the national conversation.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "Lineker: It is 'right time' to leave Match of the Day",
      "Lineker to stop hosting Match of the Day, BBC confirms"

      "In a statement, the trust told the BBC the vast majority of births at Leeds were safe, and deaths of mothers and babies were fortunately very rare.",
      "It added that Leeds cares for a higher volume of babies with complex conditions as it is one of a \"handful of specialist centres\" in the UK.",

      "Last year, 15.7% of registrable births at LTH were recorded as Asian and 11.8% were black.",

      "The two whistleblowers have described unsafe care while working at both of the units.",
      "One experienced clinical staff member, currently at Leeds and who has asked to remain anonymous, told us the service is \"completely broken\" with chronic understaffing, with the impact being that \"women and babies are not getting the care we want them to get\".",
      "These concerns are echoed by a former temporary staff member, Lisa Elliott, who says she saw \"chaotic\" care when she worked approximately 40 shifts as a maternity support worker during 2023. While in this role, supporting midwives in their care of women, she says she witnessed \"rude\" treatment of patients by staff who showed a lack of empathy.",
      "Lisa, who says she began working shifts in the hospitals in 2020, says she was present for a CQC inspection in 2024, but does not think maternity services should be rated \"good\". She says she flagged concerns about staff attitudes at the time, but they were not \"taken into account properly\".",
      "Prof Phil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals told the BBC the trust wished to apologise to the women and families who had shared their negative experiences.",
      "He highlighted its status as a specialist centre caring for \"the most poorly babies\", adding that comparing the MBBRACE-UK neonatal mortality data from LTH with other hospitals, \"even in the same specialist category, is fraught with difficulty and is misleading\".",
      "Chris Dzikiti, CQC's interim chief inspector of healthcare, said LTH's maternity services have, and continue to be, subject to close oversight.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",

    "summary": "There is a risk too many people are being diagnosed as obese, with weight-loss drugs in high demand.",
    "story": [
      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",
      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",
      "\"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says.",
      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89",
      "divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22",
      "display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",
      "Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website",
      "But BMI has limitations.",
      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",
      "But others worry pressure on health budgets could mean less money for patients in the \"pre-obesity\" category.",

      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

    "summary": "On security and on the economy, Westminster feels both worry and hope as Donald Trump heads back to the White House.",
    "story": [
      "\"Everybody's nervous \u2013 because they simply don't know what he is going to do.\"",
      "That is the basic truth about Trump for governments, business bosses, military chiefs, and maybe you feel it too as he gets ready to make his incredible political comeback official.",
      "He will take the Oath of Office for the second time on Monday, becoming the most powerful man in the Western world and in charge of the UK's biggest trading partner. Soon after, he can sign executive orders that might affect how the UK makes a living or defends itself.",
      "The range of risks is enormous. The opportunities are too.",
      "Trump and his team are different this time round, more prepared, with a more aggressive agenda perhaps, but his delight in keeping the world guessing seems undimmed. It's this uncertainty accompanying Trump that Whitehall and Westminster find so shocking.",
      "How can the UK prepare for what it can't yet know?",
      "Stay out of the circus",
      "A small group of senior ministers has been trying.",
      "There have been series of secret \"mini-cabinet\" meetings, with the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, and the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds \"trying to plan for what might come\", according to one source.",
      "One insider tells me there hasn't been too much preparation for multiple specific scenarios because \"you'd drive yourself crazy\" trying to guess Trump's next steps. But another source says various papers have been prepared to be presented to the wider Cabinet.",
      "I'm told the focus has been \"looking for opportunities\" rather than panicking about whether Trump might follow through on some of his more outlandish statements, such as annexing Canada.",
      "The PM's picked one of Labour's wiliest operators as his voice in DC, Lord Mandelson, who on Friday chose to write a piece for Fox News, Trump's favourite news outlet. He was incredibly rude about Trump in the not-so-distant past but now heaps praise on him \u2013 and he's not the only Labour figure to change his tune.",
      "(As we revealed in our newsletter on Thursday, sadly for Jock and Poppy, Mandelson's border collie and schnauzer, the Foreign Office travel budget won't stretch for them to travel to DC in canine style on the Queen Mary 2 ocean liner.)",
      "The government might not have been in power during Trump's last term, but in Westminster, and in the City, there's a universal memory of his late-night social media posts causing frenzies.",
      "There is a determination this time round to stay out of the circus.",
      "One senior figure says diplomatically: \"We will be calm and nimble.\"",
      "With less politesse, another source who's dealt with Trump said: \"Trump is going to say things that make Labour MPs mad \u2013 don't brief that the PM is personally upset. Put your big nappy on and ignore it.\"",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "Keeping us safe - and anxiety about 'nightmare scenario'",
      "The hallmark of the relationship with our \"chief ally\", as described by a senior government source, is helping keep each other safe. At a time of unique instability around the world, the number of unknowns are deeply uncomfortable for Westminster and other allied capitals.",
      "There is no question the intelligence and security relationship is incredibly close and was maintained during Trump's first term \u2013 despite some pretty big surprises at the UK end.",
      "One source remembers that \"the biggest jaw dropper was after the Salisbury attacks\", when two Russian agents used the nerve agent Novichok on the streets of the UK. President Trump was at Chequers with then-PM Theresa May and her team, and seemed reluctant to take the attack as seriously as the UK was demanding.",
      "One of those present explains: \"We were arguing about how bad and destabilising that was \u2013 he asked why. We said a state with nuclear weapons had used this on the soil of another state with nukes, and he said, 'I didn't know the UK had nuclear weapons'.\"",
      "But during that first term, despite Trump's seeming threats to NATO, his bellicose rhetoric did push more European states to cough up extra cash for defence. The Abraham Accords were signed, though those agreements did not, as Trump boasted at the time, achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. But they did mark progress.",
      "Has Trump promised too much on US economy?",
      "Bowen: Israel has changed since Donald Trump's last term \u2013 has he?",
      "Decoding Donald Trump's new official portrait",
      "There is, though, inside government, genuine anxiety about what's described as the \"nightmare scenario\".",
      "If the US cuts support for Ukraine, emboldening Russia, Europe might not agree about how \u2013 or if \u2013 to fight. That could leave Nato, the western defence alliance, split and fundamentally weakened. Sources question, however, whether this would really serve Trump's interests. After all he needs allies and a united West to combat China, America's biggest rival.",
      "While grappling with the unpredictability \u2013 Trump's wild half-threats of making Canada the 51st State or grabbing Greenland \u2013 sources inside government also spot opportunities. One senior figure says: \"In Ukraine and the Middle East there are options opening up. We need to partner so as to influence what the US does in these foreign policy priorities.\"",
      "This week, I interviewed the former secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, who echoed that sentiment.",
      "He told me: \"[Trump] has language and a way of expressing himself which sometimes creates uncertainty, creates some noise, and I think that our main task \u2013 friends and allies \u2013 is then to find ways to deal with that uncertainty in a way that minimizes the risks to all of us.\"",
      "Sources point to a weaker Iran, progress towards the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel, and a growing sense that both sides want to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end. Trump's bravado about ending the war in a day has already softened to a three-to-six-month ambition and \"there's no sign of a rush to abandonment now\", says one insider.",
      "But there is a sense in Kyiv and Whitehall that a negotiation is coming. The UK's hope is to help shape America's approach rather than panic about the US upping sticks.",
      "Stoltenberg is also urging Trump to continue the supply of weapons to Ukraine so as to strengthen its position in any future negotiation with Putin.",
      "\"The paradox is that weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace in Ukraine,\" he added.",
      "And while the government is miles away from accepting anything like Trump's demand to increase defence spending to 5%, there is a private acknowledgement at senior levels in Whitehall that his demand for Europe to spend more of its own money on defence in Europe is not entirely illogical \u2013 and it's helpful to those making the case for more cash on defence here.",
      "Economic nerves",
      "While some hedge fund traders might cash in from the kind of volatility Trump might create, there are plenty of nerves in other parts of the economy.",
      "That's partly down to his tendency to sound off. A City source says: \"You're always heart in mouth, waiting for the next wacky idea, or for him to say something crazy that is going to impact your business, a $10bn deal that's on the slate, and you are three quarters of the way there \u2013 suddenly he'll say something that can make it fall to bits overnight.\"",
      "And it's not just his late-night online posts causing worry. One of his sells to the American public was to help those trading at home by putting taxes on imports, or tariffs, making it much more expensive for other countries to sell into the States.",
      "But as the IMF warned yesterday, slapping extra tariffs on other countries could hit them hard, and impact the rest of the world's earning power.",
      "In Cabinet there's awareness of how big a departure it would be if Trump goes as far as he has suggested. One minister told me: \"It's a huge moment of history \u2013 American pledging a different way of doing business to what's essentially been in place since the second world war.\"",
      "China and the EU, the other two big trading blocs, would be likely to answer back which could lead to \"huge ramifications of a global trade war\", the minister acknowledges.",
      "Another senior figure warns the UK might struggle to be relevant in a bust up on that scale, saying there'll be an \"arm wrestle between the three \u2013 they won't pay the UK or our interests very much attention\".",
      "As Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, looks to roll back regulation and cut tax, a City insider suggests the UK could fall out of favour because Trump's ambition is to build a very different economy to ours, and that could create a tension of its own.",
      "But another City insider points out that the stock market is \"one of the metrics he cares most about\", and that it is driven by the big tech companies, many of whom depend on selling into China. \"The love affair with the tech bros mean he's not going to want to undermine too much of that,\" they said.",
      "Leader to leader",
      "Whether it's on the economy or Ukraine or any other issue, the relationship between president and prime minister will be absolutely crucial.",
      "Starmer and Trump could hardly be more different. A lawyerly leader known as \"Mr Rules\" versus a man who is a convicted felon and has made a career out of behaving as if rules don't apply to him.",
      "A No 10 source says forget all the noise, and points to the two men meeting in autumn and holding three phone calls since. \"It is the direct conversations that really matter \u2013 whatever Trump's personal style it's clear the substance is there,\" they say, adding that the PM's calm temperament helps.",
      "But others who've dealt with Trump in government, and been on calls with Trump and previous prime ministers, warn how difficult it can be. \"On a good day, fantastic, on a bad day, you'd be crouching,\" one source said.",
      "Another former official who was part of meetings with Trump and Boris Johnson said \"they were like two silverbacks wrestling\", making staff listening in next door cry with laughter. Johnson would \"flatter him obsequiously\" to get what he wanted.",
      "The official was also on calls between Trump and May. These were totally different, with \"more than a whiff of misogyny, he would shout over her\" and talk about the Queen or invite her to play golf, rather than discuss tricky subjects May wanted to raise.",
      "They believe handling Trump will be Sir Keir's biggest challenge: \"We sent him a vicar's daughter, then a pirate who knew how to handle him, now a human rights lawyer,\" they say, adding \"it's not going to work in a world increasingly like the time of 1930s strong men\".",
      "Whatever happens behind closed doors, as America's closest ally, defending Trump's decisions could be incredibly uncomfortable for the prime minister.",
      "A former No 10 official says: \"If Trump says there'll have to be partition in Ukraine, Boris will say awful, others in Labour will say awful, but if Starmer won't sell it in Europe, Trump will take offence and he will punish him.\"",
      "Starmer's allies are more sanguine that \"the politics don't have to match for the relationship to be a success\".",
      "And a success is what they must hope for. It is no secret Labour would have preferred the Democrats and some staff even went to bang on doors for Kamala Harris.",
      "The question for government is how to influence Trump to get what the UK wants, and how to keep its head when the inevitable dramas arrive.",
      "A foreign policy insider told me: \"It might come at a price, but it is in our interest for him to be a success, not be cantankerous.\"",
      "The incoming president is perhaps both an emblem and a product of the changed and uncertain times we live in. As one minister says, \"it's all gone in Trump's direction\".",
      "It is impossible to be sure what Donald Trump, mark two, will do. But after his incredible comeback, and months of nerves on both sides of the Atlantic, we don't have long to wait.",

      "They could uphold the UK's position - or order the UK to change or drop its ban, in which case Brussels could ultimately retaliate with tariffs on British exports if ministers refused to comply.",
      "Under the trade deal, a final ruling must be delivered by the end of April, although it could be issued earlier. There is no right to appeal.",
      "It comes as the UK prepares for tricky negotiations with the EU over new catch limits from June next year, when current arrangements under the trade deal run out.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is also hoping to persuade EU leaders to strike new deals in areas such as security and food trade, as part of a wider \"reset\" in relations with the UK.",
      "Environmental plaudits",
      "Sandeel, a group of small eel-like fish species, is a jointly managed fish stock under the trade deal. It is not caught for culinary reasons and is unlikely to be found on restaurant menus in European capitals.",
      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",
      "But the dispute will be watched closely for how the judges balance the UK's right to take conservation measures with economic rights.",

      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",

      "The government resisted the calls, but on Thursday announced a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries.",
      "Data protection minister Sir Chris Bryant told the BBC it was \"certainly true\" that Musk had sparked more debate.",

      "The prime minister condemned the lack of consistency when people use the phrase \"never again\", as people rightly condemn the persecution of Jewish people during World War Two, but fail to call out antisemitism in other circumstances.",
      "\"But where is never again, when we see the poison of antisemitism rising around the world in aftermath of October 7?",
      "\"Where is never again, when the pulse of fear is beating in our own Jewish community, as people are despicably targeted once again for the very same reason, because they are Jewish,\" Sir Keir added.",

      "Last August, the Community Security Trust - a Jewish security charity - said reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK in the first half of 2024 had reached another record high. The charity said the record-high figures were a continuation of the impact of antisemitic reactions to the 7 October attack and ongoing war in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has triggered a row after saying her party wants to explore greater means-testing of government support.",
      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Why do politicians keep talking about locks?",
      "During a phone-in on LBC, Badenoch said the UK, like other Western nations, faced a \"structural problem\" because people were living longer while having fewer children.",
      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",
      "She went on to add: \"Means-testing is something which we don't do properly here.",
      "\"Starting with the triple lock is not how to solve the problem, we need to start with why are we not making the same kind of money we used to make?\"",
      "'Bungling Badenoch'",
      "However, her comments were seized on by opposition parties to suggest the Tories were planning to shift their stance on the triple lock, which Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all pledged to continue in last year's general election.",
      "Labour said the Tory leader had \"let the mask slip\" and was preparing to cut the state pension, while the Liberal Democrats said \"bungling Badenoch\" was preparing to make pension cuts \"her first new policy\".",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this, adding the party had \"always protected the triple lock\" and accusing Labour of \"skewing her words for political gain\".",
      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",
      "As a Tory leadership candidate last September, she appeared to suggest maternity pay was \"excessive\" before later arguing she was making a more general point about the burden of regulations on business.",
      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has argued the policy is \"unsustainable\" in the \"very, very long term\".",
      "Since taking office Labour has decided to means-test the winter fuel payment, a \u00a3200-\u00a3300 pension supplement that was previously paid to all pensioners, by linking eligibility to pension credit.",
      "Badenoch said she opposed that decision, arguing it would mean pensioners \"on the breadline\" would miss out. She added, however, that she supported the idea it should not go to \"millionaires\".",
      "Writing later on X, Badenoch said the government needed \"better mechanisms\" to target support, instead of using \"proxies\" such as eligibility for pension credit or free school meals."

      "On Friday, official figures revealed retail sales volumes in the UK fell 0.3% in December, despite analyst expectations of a 0.4% increase, with the drop driven by a \"very poor month\" for food sales, according to Hannah Finselbach, senior statistician at the Office for National Statistics.",
      "She said food sales sank last month to the lowest level since 2013, but that it was a \"better month for clothing shops and household goods stores, where retailers reported strong Christmas trading\".",
      "Last year, Next was one of the signatories on a letter from UK retailers to Chancellor Rachel Reeves calling for a rethink to the Budget measures.",
      "The letter said High Street job losses were \"inevitable\" and also warned that prices would rise and shops would close.",
      "But in an interview with BBC, the chancellor defended what she called \"difficult decisions\", arguing they were \"the right decisions in the national interest\".",
      "Next made over a billion pounds in profit last year, and is expected to repeat that this year. Meanwhile other big retailers with large workforces - like Tesco and Sainsbury's - have also made bumper profits. Lord Wolfson accepts that they are the \"broad shoulders\" that the chancellor insisted must bear the brunt of tax rises needed to rebuild public services.",
      "\"Government did need to raise taxes. I've got nothing against lowering the threshold for NI in principle but the speed at which it is going to happen, the lack of consultation, that is the problem.\"",
      "Lord Wolfson also has concerns about a new workers' rights bill.",
      "This promises to give greater protection from unfair dismissal and \"exploitative\" zero-hours contracts, with employees able to request a guaranteed hours contract based on hours worked over a period. But that could pose a problem for retailers.",
      "\"We offer staff extra hours in the run-up to Christmas. If the legislation is going to mean that those hours have to be contractually binding forever then we just won't be able to do it at all, it would be impossible.\"",

      "\"Over the last five years the government has employed 100,000 more civil servants.",
      "\"We can't go on spending over 40% of GDP on the public sector. It has to become more efficient and if the government can commit to doing that \u2013 and deliver it \u2013 then I think that will do more for business confidence than anything else.\"",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has criticised her predecessors for mishandling Brexit, saying leaving the EU without a growth plan was a \"mistake\".",
      "In her first major speech of 2025, Badenoch attacked the Labour's government but also her own party for repeatedly pledging to lower immigration as numbers \"kept going up\" and for promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050 without a clear plan.",
      "Badenoch pledged to tell hard truths \"even when it's difficult to hear\" to restore trust with the public.",
      "Labour chairwoman Ellie Reeves accused the Tory leader of \"doing the exact opposite\" of rebuilding trust - offering nothing in opposition but more \"infighting\".",
      "Badenoch promises change after historic Tory leadership win",
      "Starmer and Badenoch clash over economy at PMQs",
      "UK must rejoin EU customs union, says Lib Dem Davey",
      "Badenoch said the public \"will never trust politicians unless we can accept our mistakes\".",
      "\"I will acknowledge the Conservative Party made mistakes,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch has not named who she holds responsible, but in her speech said: \"We announced that we would leave the European Union before we had a plan for growth outside the EU.",
      "\"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that.",
      "\"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up.",
      "\"These mistakes were made because we told people what they wanted to hear first and then tried to work it out later.",
      "\"That is going to stop under my leadership. If we are going to turn our country around, we're going to have to say some things that aren't easy to hear.\"",
      "Badenoch served as a minister under her three Conservative prime ministers - Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.",
      "A committed Brexiteer she voted for both Johnson and Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement after becoming an MP in 2017.",
      "She served as international trade secretary under Truss, responsible for landing post-Brexit trade deals and promoting UK exports globally.",
      "Badenoch retained the post under Sunak who added the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Badenoch claimed that as business secretary, she helped the Tory government scrap \"about 4,000 EU laws\" and end the \"supremacy of the European Court of Justice\".",
      "But she admitted she left office with unfinished work.",
      "\"What we need to start doing is looking at where we have competitive advantage with countries around the world and use our regulatory system to exploit that competitive advantage,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch said she would \"back\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"if he does the right thing using Brexit\".",
      "\"I do not care who gets the credit - we just have to start getting our country back on track,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch used her speech to draw a sharp contrast with Sir Keir, who she claims \"does not believe he's ever made a mistake\".",
      "She attacked Labour for announcing policies without a plan to back them up.",
      "\"When you haven't worked out what you're going to do in opposition, you will accept whatever you're given in government,\" she said.",
      "\"That's why Rachel Reeves announced mad and bad ideas on snatching winter fuel and taxing family farms.",
      "\"Those options were presented to us, time and time again by officials, and we rejected them time and time again because they would hurt so many people for so little benefit.\"",
      "Badenoch, who was elected Tory leader in November, has previously said she will focus on rebuilding voters' trust before announcing her own policies.",
      "In her November victory speech, Badenoch promised to \"renew\" the party by returning the Conservatives to \"first principles\".",
      "Responding to her latest comments, Ellie Reeves said: \"The public rightly lost trust in the Conservatives after 14 long years of failure in government.\"",
      "She accused Badenoch of offering \"another speech, but no apology for her role in Liz Truss' disastrous mini-Budget that crashed the economy and left a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances\".",
      "\"The Conservatives under Kemi Badenoch have nothing to offer in opposition apart from recklessly continuing to make unfunded spending commitments and overseeing yet more Conservative chaos and infighting.\"",
      "In a media Q&A after her speech, Badenoch faced criticism that she had struck a \"depressing\" and \"joyless\" tone, giving Nigel Farage and Reform UK room to champion right-wing politics with a positive spin.",
      "She said Farage \"has had a head start\" after \"knocking around for 20 plus years\" as the leader of UKIP, the Brexit Party and now Reform UK.",
      "\"I have been leading the Conservative Party for 10 weeks - let's see where we are in a few months and a few years,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch also dismissed the idea of the Tories merging with Reform UK, saying:  \"Nigel Farage says he wants to destroy the Conservative Party, why on earth would we merge with that?\"",
      "Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"It will take a lot more than this half-hearted apology for the people of this country to forgive or forget the toxic legacy of the Conservative government, in which Badenoch herself so prominently served.",
      "\"Badenoch claimed that Boris Johnson's partygate scandal was overblown, cheered on Liz Truss's mini budget and oversaw botched trade deals that sold out British farmers.\""

      "The Lib Dem leader's speech was highly critical of Trump, who will be sworn in for his second term in the White House on Monday, describing him as \"the first convicted criminal\" to take the oath of office.",
      "Sir Ed noted that Trump had praised President Putin's invasion of Ukraine as \"genius\", said \"trade wars are good\", and called himself \"tariff man\".",
      "The new US administration would be \"a threat to peace and prosperity\" around the world, he warned.",
      "But \"The Donald\" could not be ignored and had to be dealt with, he added.",

      "Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC the Lib Dem call for a new customs union deal showed \"how clueless they are because President Trump is much more likely to impose tariffs on the European Union\".",

      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the Lib Dems \"only ever think about Europe\".",
      "\"Of course it is a major market, but this is a government that wants to improve that relationship with the EU but also wants to do work with the US, with India, with the Gulf,\" Reynolds told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"I think the UK could be positioned as the best economy between those major trading blocs and I think what the Lib Dems are saying today is not taking into account that wider global position\".",
      "'Not ideological'",
      "Sir Ed's speech was his first to focus on relations with Brussels since he became Liberal Democrat leader following the 2019 general election, when the party's campaign to stop Brexit saw it slump to just 11 MPs.",
      "At last year's general election, the party gained a record 72 seats on the back of a campaign that barely mentioned the EU at all, even though rejoining the bloc remains the party's long-term aim.",

      "Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on US imports after he returns to the White House next week, sparking anxiety in many countries that rely on exports.",
      "Sir Ed attacked the government for rejecting a new customs union with the EU, saying it would be the best way to tear down trade barriers and \"turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term\".",
      "He urged ministers to negotiate a deal with the EU this year, with the aim of forming a fresh customs union by 2030, arguing this would allow the UK to deal with Trump \"from a position of strength, not weakness\".",
      "There are no tariffs or other barriers to trade between countries in the EU customs union - which the UK left in January 2021 when Brexit took effect.",
      "But member countries impose common tariffs on all goods entering the union from outside.",
      "Official figures released on Thursday indicate the UK economy grew in November for the first time in three months - after shrinking in September and October.",
      "But the 0.1% increase in the size of the economy was smaller than most economists had predicted.",
      "The figures follow recent turbulence in financial markets which has pushed government borrowing costs to their highest level in years.",

      "A Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.",
      "It ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.",

    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:05:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Wild tigers killed nearly 40 people in Nepal between 2019 and 2023. Solutions are hard to come by.",
    "story": [
      "Nepal has been celebrated globally for tripling its tiger population in a decade - but Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli thinks the country may have been too successful.",
      "\"In such a small country, we have more than 350 tigers\u2026 We can't have so many tigers and let them eat up humans,\" he said last month at an event organised to review the country's COP29 outcomes.",
      "Attacks by tigers claimed nearly 40 lives and injured 15 people between 2019 and 2023, according to government data. But local communities say the figure is much higher.",
      "\"For us, 150 tigers are enough,\" Oli declared in December, even suggesting that Nepal could send its prized big cats to other countries as gifts.",
      "How many tigers are too many?",
      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",

      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",
      "S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as \"a very complex process\" that needed extreme precision and coordination.",
      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",
      "Isro, known for economising its missions, is also using a part of the rocket that carried SpaDeX to space - which in normal circumstances would become space debris - to conduct some important experiments in orbit for three months.",
      "Poem \u2013 short for PS4-Orbital Experiment Module - is carrying 24 payloads and has already carried out two successful experiments.",
      "The first demonstrated seed germination. Last week, Isro tweeted a video saying that \"cowpea sprouts have unveiled their first leaves in space in micro-gravity\". Micro-gravity is the near-weightless condition experienced aboard spacecraft.",

      "Could this be what our home on Moon or Mars might look like?",
      "Scientists say it's great news as it means that future astronauts could produce food during long-duration missions.",
      "The second experiment involves the robotic arm which, Ms Mitra says, is among the rocket's most important payloads. A video on Isro's X account shows the robotic arm moving to grab a piece of space debris.",
      "Ms Mitra says this arm will play \"a crucial role during the building of the space station as it could be used to capture and put things in place\". It will also come in handy in Chandrayaan-4 - India's next mission to the Moon which will aim to collect and bring back lunar soil samples, she adds.",

    "title": "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:08:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK led the way in this field of science until recently - but now other countries have overtaken. So, how can that lead be recovered?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.",
      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

      "After 15 months of war that began with a brutal attack on Israel by Hamas and ended with much of the Gaza Strip levelled by Israel, a ceasefire came into effect on Sunday that saw three women hostages released from Gaza and 90 Palestinians freed from Israeli jails in return.",
      "For two tense hours on Sunday morning, the ceasefire looked as though it might falter from the very outset. Hamas failed to provide the names of the three hostages it planned to release, prompting Israel to postpone the ceasefire and continue its air strikes on Gaza.",
      "In what should have been the first hours of peace, from 08:30 local time (06:30 GMT), at least 19 Palestinians were killed by the strikes and 36 more were wounded, the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck \"a number of terror targets\".",
      "The three hostages' names were eventually sent by Hamas to Israel, via an intermediary, and Israeli military action in Gaza ceased for the first time since a brief, week-long ceasefire and hostage exchange back in November 2023.",
      "At 11:19, Majed al-Ansari, the spokesman for the foreign ministry of Qatar, which has helped broker the ceasefire deal, wrote on X that the final obstacles had been cleared \"and thus the ceasefire has begun\".",
      "Six hours later, three Israeli hostages \u2013 Romi Gonen, 24, Doron Steinbrecher, 31, and Emily Damari, 28, who is a dual British citizen \u2013 were handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross in Gaza and then to the Israeli military. TV coverage showed chaotic scenes in Gaza City's Saraya Square as crowds massed around the vehicle carrying the hostages and Hamas fighters struggled to push the people back.",
      "There was a brief glimpse of the three women as they were taken from the van, amid the surging crowds. From the handover point in Gaza they were driven by the IDF to the nearby Re'im military base in southern Israel to be met by their mothers.",
      "Extensive planning by the IDF had gone into the delicate handover, with military medics and psychologists readied for the first stages of the process at a reception centre designed to ease the hostages' transition.",
      "From Re'im, they were transferred by helicopter to the Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv to be reunited with their wider families and receive further medical attention. Two of the three reportedly suffered gunshot wounds in the attack on 7 October 2023, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.",

Ninety-seven hostages are still in captivity, Israeli authorities said, though dozens of those are presumed dead.",
      "In Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 46,900 people have been killed during Israel's offensive and the majority of the strip's pre-war population of 2.3 million has been displaced, many civilians yearning for home learned over the weekend that their long wait would continue.",
      "The IDF, which should withdraw its troops from populated areas during the first phase of the deal, warned civilians on Sunday not to approach the buffer zone it had created along Gaza's borders or the military zone in central Gaza, known as the Netzarim corridor, which cuts the north of the territory from the south.",
      "It was expected to be a week before some displaced people in the south can cross the corridor and move back to their homes in the north.",
      "For civilians who have spent 15 months in desperate conditions in tents and makeshift shelters in Gaza, suffering from malnutrition and disease, the relief of the long-awaited peace was tempered by the immense scale of the destruction and loss.",
      "\"By God, the feelings are mixed,\" said Helen Jabri, 41, in a phone interview from a shelter in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.",
      "\"Our hearts are aching for the people we have lost,\" she said. \"My brother and his entire family were lost. My father is a prisoner. We are very happy that the torrent of blood has stopped, but there is pain here in every house.\"",
      "Some began packing up and moving on foot Gaza on Sunday, particularly from the most southern areas including Rafah. But it will be a long time before any sense of home or normalcy can be returned to the vast numbers of displaced. The northern parts of the strip, including Gaza City, have been subjected in places to almost total destruction during the war.",
      "The UN's satellite agency estimates that 60% of structures across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli strikes and demolitions, meaning many displaced will have to remain for now in shelters or continue sleeping rough, prolonging a massive humanitarian crisis.",
      "\"The vast majority of shelters are overcrowded and many are simply living out in the open or in makeshift structures,\" said Juliette Touma, communications director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. \"They lack basic needs like warm clothes. I would not call these living conditions, they are not conditions fit for human beings.\"",
      "Noura Zakout, a ministry of education employee from Gaza City, told the BBC from a shelter in Khan Younis on Sunday that she would return to the city at the first opportunity \"no matter the destruction and ruin\".",
      "\"I just want to go to the city and smell its air,\" she said. \"We know we have no home to go back to, but at least now with this ceasefire we can take a breath. Like a diver who goes deep underwater, we have come up for a moment for air.\"",
      "In Israel, the finalising of the first part of the deal brought relief for three hostage families after 15 months of pain. Video footage released late on Sunday night showed joyous, tearful reunions at the medical centre near Tel Aviv.",
      "In a statement, Mandy Damari said her daughter's \"nightmare in Gaza was over\" and thanked \"everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily\".",
      "For others, it brought another prolonging of uncertainty. Thirty-three hostages will be released in the first phase but their condition is not known and some are reported to have been killed. Among the remaining hostages, only two children are left - brothers Kfir and Ariel Bibas, aged two and four.",
      "The boys were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October 2023 alongside their parents Sheri and Yarden. Hamas announced in December 2023 that Sheri and the boys had been killed, but Israeli authorities have never confirmed the deaths.",
      "\"It scares me to hope,\" Yarden's cousin Eylon Keshet said, on Saturday night, on what would be Kfir's second birthday.",
      "\"I'm not letting myself truly imagine it, because when I start to imagine it I feel like my stomach turning,\" he said. Seeing Sheri and the boys alive would, he said, be \"a miracle\".",
      "Daniel Lifschitz, whose grandfather Oded is the second-oldest hostage, at 84, said on Sunday it was \"wonderful to see the beginning of the ceasefire\".",
      "\"We are getting closer to the day when we might see my grandfather,\" he said. \"But at the same time, today has been very very hard, because we don't know whether he is dead or alive. We don't know whether to prepare for a funeral or a festival.\"",
      "In exchange for the three hostages released on Sunday, Israel's prison service released 90 Palestinians from Ofer detention centre in the occupied West Bank early on Monday. They were also handed over to the Red Cross, before being taken to a designated area from where they will be allowed to return home.",
      "In the nearby West Bank town of Beitunia, crowds gathered to wait for the prisoners, with some starting fires to create roadblocks.",
      "For families in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, there is still great concern that the fragile ceasefire could collapse over the next six weeks. The delays on Sunday morning were quickly overcome, but a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that Israel \"retains the right to continue our war aims\" in Gaza if the conditions of the deal are broken again.",
      "In Israel on Sunday, several far-right ministers resigned in protest over the terms of the deal, further weakening Netanyahu's already fragile hold on government.",
      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, the deal's most prominent critic, has long objected to the ceasefire, saying it comes ahead of Israel's main war aim of destroying Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "He declared on Sunday that his far-right Jewish Power party would resign en masse from the government. Though he pledged not to attempt to overthrow the government, the move leaves the embattled prime minister with just a razor-thin majority in parliament.",
      "Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he would not speak against those who had objected to the deal, which he said brought a \"heavy price for Israel\".",
      "\"Any agreement with a terror organisation is a bad event,\" he said. \"Releasing terrorists from our jails is a heavy price, with risks.\"",
      "Saar acknowledged that there had been a \"very serious debate within government\" about the terms of the deal. \"But we are doing it because of our commitment to our brothers and sisters who are under captivity for more than 15 months already. We will do our utmost to release them.\"",
      "The BBC understands that under an agreement with Israel, control of checkpoints in Gaza previously manned by the Israeli military would be handed over to Hamas police, which will manage the flow of displaced people north as Israel withdraws. The arrangement raises questions about how fighters will be prevented from also moving north, and there are fears of chaos as a mass of people moves and attempts to access aid entering the strip.",
      "Aid lorries began entering Gaza on Thursday 15 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect. But the scale of the need is enormous. Even before the conflict, Gaza was heavily dependent on aid. With farmland and food infrastructure destroyed, Unwra has said 600 lorries should cross into Gaza every day.",
      "Majed al-Ansari, the Qatari foreign ministry spokesman, told the BBC that a dedicated operations centre in Cairo would monitor the ceasefire from abroad, to try and make sure there was a \"minimum level of chaos as a result of aid going in\". But he added that for the first phase, Hamas would essentially be in charge of the process in Gaza.",
      "Ansari described the deal as the \"last chance for Gaza, and the last chance for the region\".",
      "\"This is the deal for hope, this is the deal for the future, this is a deal for all of us collectively,\" he said.",
      "US President-elect Donald Trump, whose envoy Steve Witkoff helped broker the deal alongside President Joe Biden's team, welcomed the ceasefire in a post on his social media site Truth Social. \"Hostages starting to come out today! Three wonderful young women will be first,\" he wrote.",
      "In Gaza City on Sunday night, Abdallah Shabbir, a young emergency doctor who had worked relentlessly since the day the war began, seeing hundreds of dead and treating thousands of wounded, was allowing himself a small moment of joy.",
      "\"It is only because these were my people I was able to keep going,\" he said. \"I don't know how to express the feeling I have now, but there is joy. The most important thing is that the bloodshed has stopped. God willing, everything else will follow.\""

      "The mother of US journalist Austin Tice, abducted in Syria while on a reporting trip in 2012 and one of the longest-held American hostages, has returned to the country for the first time in a decade to renew the search for her son.",
      "Debra Tice's visit comes in the wake of the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in a lighting rebel offensive last month. Her son, a freelance journalist who is now 43, was taken captive as he travelled through the Damascus suburb of Darayya covering the Syrian civil war.",
      "\"We had information, but the whole world changed,\" she said in an interview in the Syrian capital, Damascus, referring to Assad's removal from power.",
      "\"We have no idea where he is now. It feels a little bit like square one, trying to figure that out again.\"",

      "Last month, after rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Assad and seized power, President Joe Biden said the US believed Tice was alive, but that his whereabouts remained unknown.

      "Roy has maintained he is innocent and is expected to appeal against the verdict in a higher court.",
      "The victim's family said they wanted him to be hanged, and that they were \"shocked\" by the sentence.",

      "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) - India's premier crime agency that investigated the case - had demanded the death penalty for Roy.",
      "But on Monday, the judge disagreed, saying he had considered all the evidence and did not consider the case to be a \"rarest-of-rare\" crime.",
      "Before announcing the sentence, the judge also gave Roy a chance to speak in court. He claimed that he was innocent and was being \"falsely implicated\" in the case.",
      "Without taking any names, Roy alleged that there were \"others involved in the crime\".",
      "The judge dismissed Roy's claims and said the court had already found him guilty of all charges.",
      "Some politicians and social media users criticised the sentence.",
      "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that she was not satisfied with the court's order. \"We want justice. Such criminals should be hanged,\" she told reporters."

      "There is a massive task of rebuilding ahead. The UN and aid agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of obstructing the flow of aid; the United States at one point threatened to curb military assistance to Israel unless more aid was allowed into Gaza. Israel denies restricting aid.",
      "Aid trucks were crossing into the strip throughout the afternoon. Among them was a convoy from the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization, which we reported on last week, on the journey from Amman towards Gaza.",
      "Forklift trucks moved tonnes of medicine and food to help the nearly two million displaced in Gaza - roughly 90% of the population.",
      "Such aid is tangible assistance. It can be weighed, counted, loaded, and ultimately distributed. People can be fed and given medicine. But there is another challenge whose demands are immense, and which will have a profound impact on the future of Gaza.",
      "The war has created unknown numbers of traumatised adults and children. We have recorded some of their stories but are aware of the tens of thousands more that remain untold.",
      "Children have faced acute suffering. According to a survey of the caregivers of 504 children, for the UK charity War Child, 96% of children felt death was imminent.",

      "Just after the ceasefire agreement was announced we went back to see what had become of Amr al Hindi. He was living with his grandparents, and it was clear they loved him with care and tenderness. The child had three of his toes amputated after the bombing, but was managing to walk normally.",
      "Amr sat on his grandfather's lap and stared directly at the camera. He was still, and composed, as if he was looking out from behind a thick protective screen. He began to speak about his brother Ali and how he had wanted to go to Jordan and study to become a doctor.",
      "\"I wish to become like Ali. I want to fulfil his dream, and travel to Jordan to become a doctor,\" he said. But over the last few words tears began to fall and he broke into sobs.",

      "They could uphold the UK's position - or order the UK to change or drop its ban, in which case Brussels could ultimately retaliate with tariffs on British exports if ministers refused to comply.",
      "Under the trade deal, a final ruling must be delivered by the end of April, although it could be issued earlier. There is no right to appeal.",
      "It comes as the UK prepares for tricky negotiations with the EU over new catch limits from June next year, when current arrangements under the trade deal run out.",

      "Sandeel, a group of small eel-like fish species, is a jointly managed fish stock under the trade deal. It is not caught for culinary reasons and is unlikely to be found on restaurant menus in European capitals.",
      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",
      "But the dispute will be watched closely for how the judges balance the UK's right to take conservation measures with economic rights.",

      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:49:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC spoke to officials from both sides of the talks to piece together how the Gaza deal was done.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli and Hamas negotiators never came face to face - but by the end, just one floor separated them.",
      "Ceasefire talks via middlemen from Qatar, Egypt and the US dragged on for several months, at times without hope. Now the key players were all inside one building in Doha and the pace was frantic.",
      "A deal was close but things had gone wrong before: one source described a last-minute push to stop the agreement breaking down while a podium was being set up so the Qatari prime minister could announce it.",
      "\"Literally, negotiations were up until 10 minutes before the press conference. So that's how things were stitched up at the last minute,\" the source familiar with the talks said.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of officials on all sides of the negotiations to piece together how the final fraught days of the secretive process unfolded.",
      "Shifting ground",
      "The deal did not come out of the blue.",
      "The overall framework of the agreement reached on 15 January was broadly the same as the proposal set out by President Joe Biden during a White House address last May. It uses the same three-phase approach and will see a ceasefire, Israeli hostages released in return for Palestinian prisoners, and the Israeli military's gradual withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "But sources familiar with the discussions agreed the dynamics of the talks shifted decisively in mid-December and the pace changed.",
      "Hamas, already reeling from Israel's killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza two months earlier, had become increasingly isolated. Its Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah had been decimated and had agreed to a truce with Israel. Bashar al-Assad's Iran-backed government in Syria had also been swept away.",
      "The view in Washington is that Hamas was forced to abandon the idea that \"the cavalry was coming to save it\", as one US official put it.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate how fundamentally the equation changed and what that [did] for Hamas's calculus,\" says a senior Biden administration official familiar with the talks.",
      "An Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous said Hamas was \"not in a rush\" to strike a deal and had been \"dictating\" rather than negotiating. They said that changed after the death of Sinwar and Israeli operations against Hamas's allies in the region.",
      "On top of that, the official said, there was \"momentum created by both US administrations\" - the Biden White House and the incoming Trump team.",
      "\"We could not achieve a deal like this until conditions had changed,\" the official added.",
      "On 12 December, Biden's negotiating team visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and CIA director Bill Burns were all in attendance.",
      "A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the meeting lasted \"multiple hours\" and focused on the \"new regional equation\" and \"how we catapult from the Lebanon ceasefire into another round of intensive discussions\" on Gaza.",

      "How historic deal was sealed with 10 minutes to spare",
      "WATCH:  Mixed feelings in Israel about deal with Hamas",
      "There was also another piece on the chessboard by this stage: Donald Trump.",
      "On 16 December, weeks after Trump's victory, the BBC spoke to a Hamas official who was unusually optimistic about the ceasefire efforts, suggesting they seemed to be more serious.",
      "The official - who had taken part in every set of talks since November 2023 - appeared reassured by the fact that an adviser to the incoming US president had sent a message to mediators indicating Trump wanted an agreement before his inauguration.",
      "Trump had also warned of \"all hell to pay\" if Hamas did not agree to release the hostages - but the Palestinian official was bullish.",
      "\"This time, the pressure will not be limited to Hamas, as was customary under the Biden administration,\" the official said. \"There will also be pressure on Netanyahu. He is the one obstructing the deal, and Trump seems to understand that very well.\"",
      "False dawns",
      "However, that same official's prediction that a deal could be done by Christmas proved to be optimistic.",
      "During December, the process remained beset by problems. Israel publicly ruled out releasing certain high-profile prisoners, while the White House accused Hamas of throwing up roadblocks over the hostage releases.",
      "A Biden administration official said: \"Hamas [was] refusing to agree - and this was a breakdown at that point - to the list of hostages that would be released in phase one of the deal.",
      "\"That's just so fundamental. This is a hostage release deal. Unless you agree to the list of hostages who will come out, there's not going to be a deal.\"",
      "The same official said Hamas made \"completely untrue\" claims about not knowing the location of the hostages, and added: \"We held the line and basically left the table until Hamas agreed to the hostage list.\"",
      "An anonymous Israeli official said Hamas had sought to conceal the number of living hostages and \"tried to dictate that they would send us only dead bodies\".",
      "For its part, Hamas claimed Israel unexpectedly added 11 names to the list of hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase. Hamas considered them reserve soldiers, and therefore not eligible to be released alongside the women, injured and elderly hostages due to be released in phase one.",
      "The door was left open to Qatari and Egyptian mediators to continue their efforts and on 3 January, there was an apparent breakthrough when Hamas proposed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in return.",
      "There were by now well-established terms of reference for such trades. For each hostage Hamas was to release, Israel would have to provide what had become known in the nomenclature of the draft deal as a \"key\" - meaning an agreed number or even specific identities of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A US official said: \"There's an equation for how many Palestinian prisoners come out. So for female soldiers, for example, there's a key. And for elderly males, there's a key. And for women civilians, there's a key. And this has all been worked out and the prisoners have been named, hundreds and hundreds of prisoners on the list.\"",
      "The exchange file in the negotiations - Palestinian prisoners for hostages held by Hamas - became known as \"the keys\".",
      "During this phase of the talks, Hamas also relented on two long-standing demands: the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in the first phase and a formal Israeli commitment to a total ceasefire.",
      "Sensing a breakthrough, the Egyptian mediator urgently dispatched Major General Ahmed Abdel Khaleq - who oversees the Palestinian portfolio in Egyptian intelligence - to Doha. After meeting with Hamas representatives, he secured confirmation the group would make what a senior Hamas official described as \"painful concessions.\"",
      "But on 6 January, according to a Palestinian official, Israel rejected the offer put forward by Hamas on the 11 hostages. Hamas responded by sending the BBC and other media outlets a list featuring the names and ages of 34 Israeli hostages. Two days later, the body of one of those on that list - Yosef\u00a0AlZayadni - was found inside Gaza.",
      "The list included reserve soldiers, which indicated Hamas was willing to release them in the first phase.",
      "This appeared to be an attempt to embarrass Netanyahu and rally hostage families in Israel and around the world to pressure him into accepting the deal.",
      "It was also an indication Hamas had not walked away.",
      "Metres apart",
      "Meetings stretching into the small hours of Doha's hot evenings became common during the final stretch of the negotiations.",
      "In the last month, they had developed into so-called \"proximity talks\", with both sides in the same two-storey building, according to multiple accounts from officials familiar with the details.",
      "A senior US official said Hamas's delegation was on the first floor and Israel's on the floor above. Mediators ran pieces of paper between them. Maps of Israeli troop withdrawal proposals and details about hostages or prisoners drafted for release were shuttled back and forth.",
      "\"That takes an enormous amount of work and, I have to say, all of that was not fully nailed down, really, until just the [final] hours,\" said the official.",
      "Inside the building, the delegations met separately with senior figures from Qatar and Egypt. Among those closely involved in the details was Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.",
      "Two crucial areas were worked on in the final phases of the talks: the lists for release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the positions for Israeli troop withdrawals from populated areas in Gaza during phase one.",
      "By 9 January, the pressure had escalated. Trump's envoy, Biden's envoy, and the Egyptian intelligence chief convened in Doha for a serious eight-hour negotiation session.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the BBC: \"We are at the closest point to reaching an agreement.\"",
      "Agreement had been reached on 90% of the outstanding issues, but further talks were required.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's recently appointed Middle East envoy, was dispatched to Tel Aviv to meet Netanyahu. Though not yet officially in post, the New York property tycoon had become more and more involved in the talks, which Trump was taking a keen interest in.",
      "He was about to be sent on an assignment that proved to be pivotal.",
      "End game",
      "When Trump's man in the Middle East arrived in Israel on 11 January, it was the sabbath.",
      "Witkoff was asked to wait until the sabbath had ended before he met Netanyahu but, in a breach of custom, the envoy refused and demanded to meet the prime minister immediately.",
      "Netanyahu appears to have come under serious strong-arming during the meeting and the intervention from the Trump camp to get the Israeli government to set aside its final reservations seems to have been critical.",
      "The meeting was reportedly fractious and the message to Netanyahu from the incoming president was clear: Trump wants a deal - now get it done.",
      "Commenting on those talks, an Israeli official who asked to remain anonymous said it was a \"very important meeting\".",
      "When Witkoff returned to Doha, he remained in the room with the talks, spending time with Biden's envoy Mr McGurk, in what two US officials called a \"near unprecedented\" transition effort in American diplomacy.",
      "This week, Hamas official Bassem Naim told Al Arabiya he \"couldn't imagine that [the deal] could be possible without the pressure of the incoming administration led by President Trump\" - and specifically cited Witkoff's presence at the talks.",
      "By now, the fact a deal could be imminent was out in the open and public expectation was building - not least among the families of those being held hostage and Palestinians displaced inside Gaza.",
      "The final 72 hours of talks involved a constant back and forth over the finer points of how the deal would be implemented, according to one account.",
      "One source close to the negotiations described the hammering out of \"arrangements and logistics\" for how the hostages would be released in Gaza and for the withdrawal movements of Israeli troops.",
      "On 12 January, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said \"all the officials are here in the same building\", adding: \"Tonight is decisive. We are only a few steps away from an agreement.\"",
      "That meeting lasted six hours - but, like so many times before, an impasse was reached.",
      "This time the disagreement that arose was over the mechanism for the return of displaced individuals from southern Gaza to the north.",
      "Israel wanted to search returnees and their vehicles to ensure no militants or military equipment were being transported - which Hamas refused to accept.",
      "Mediators proposed that Qatari and Egyptian technical teams conduct the searches instead. Both sides agreed and one of the final remaining stalemates was resolved.",
      "On 15 January shortly after 18:00, a Hamas negotiator wrote in a message to the BBC: \"Everything is finished.\"",
      "The podium was being readied.",

      "\"Recent continuous attacks targeting Saudi Hospital have intensified dramatically, it has become part of our daily lives,\" Dr Ibo, a Darfuri who has lived in el-Fasher since 2011, told the BBC.",
      "He said the most frightening day had been when a team of medics were performing an emergency caesarean as the shelling began - a near-death experience for them all.",
      "''The first one hit the hospital's perimeter wall\u2026 [then] another shell hit the maternity operating room, the debris damaged the electrical generator, cutting off the power and plunging us into complete darkness,'' he said.",
      "The surgical team had no option but to use the torches on their phones to finish the two-hour operation.",
      "Part of the building had collapsed and the room was full of dust with shrapnel scattered all over the place.",
      "Dr Khatab Mohammed, who had been leading the surgery, described the dangers.",
      "\"The situation was dire, the environment was no longer sterile,\" the 29-year-old medic told the BBC.",
      "\"After ensuring our safety and the patient's safety from shrapnel, we cleaned her and changed our surgical gowns since our clothes were full of dust and we continued the surgery,\" he said, adding that the patient could have died from complications.",
      "After successfully delivering the baby, the doctors moved mother and new-born to another room to recover and then gathered to take a group photo.",
      "It was a testament to their survival, but Dr Mohammed added: \"I thought it might be our last photo, believing that another shell would hit the same spot and we would all die.\"",
      "They went on to perform two more life-saving emergency operations that day.",
      "These doctors - most of whom are graduates of the University of el-Fasher - have stayed put since Sudan's civil war erupted in April 2023.",
      "The conflict has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and has caused the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes.",
      "The two rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",
      "A year into the conflict, the siege of el-Fasher began. It is the only city still under army control in Darfur, where the RSF has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities.",
      "The RSF began attacking el-Fasher from three sides and cut off supply routes. In a report issued last month, the UN Human Rights Office said the fighting had left more that 780 civilians dead and more than 1,140 injured - many of them casualties of crossfire.",

      "Saudi Hospital, which is run by the Ministry of Health and funded by non-governmental organisations, the UN and MSF, specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology but is now providing all medical services - it is the only place in North Darfur state with surgical capacity.",
      "Amid shortages of medical supplies, equipment and personnel, Saudi Hospital is facing ''a heart-breaking situation that violates all humanitarian and international laws and values'', its medical director, 28-year-old Mudathir Ibrahim Suleiman, told the BBC.",
      "He recalled how terrifying it was during recent bombings: \"Pregnant women, children and staff were in shock and paralysis, some people were injured and had to be pulled out the rubble.",
      "\"All the current conditions push us to consider stopping our work, but women and children have no other place to save their lives except this hospital,\" he said.",
      "\"The staff at the hospital are doing the impossible to save lives.\"",
      "All normal aspects of life have completely disappeared from el-Fasher, especially in the northern and eastern parts. The university, for example, operates via online learning, with exam centres established in safer cities like Kassala in eastern Sudan.",
      "With widespread hunger and insecurity, the city has also emptied. About half the population have sought refuge in the nearby Zamzam camp, where an estimated 500,000 people now live in famine conditions.",
      "Saudi Hospital also serves the camp, with MSF running ambulances to bring in emergency cases.",
      "But these have also recently started coming under attack, including an incident earlier this month when a gunman shot at a \"clearly marked ambulance with the MSF logo and flag\".",
      "\"We are horrified by this deadly attack on a humanitarian crew carrying out life-saving medical work where it's desperately needed,\" MSF's Michel Olivier Lacharit\u00e9 said in a statement.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:41:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Mzwandile Mkwayi volunteered to go down into the shaft to help save the lives of scores of South African miners.",
    "story": [
      "This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing.",
      "As Mzwandile Mkwayi was lowered into the South African mine in a red metal cage attached to a hoist above ground, the first thing that struck him was the smell.",
      "\"Let me tell you something,\" he tells the BBC, \"those bodies really smelled bad\".",
      "When he got home later that day, he told his wife he could not eat the meat she had cooked.",
      "\"It's because when I spoke to the miners, they told me some of them had to eat other [people] inside the mine because there was no way they could find food. And they were also eating cockroaches,\" he said on a phone call from his home.",
      "Allegations that the miners resorted to eating human flesh in order to survive were also made by other miners who were rescued in December, in statements submitted to the high court.",
      "Mkwayi, a former convict, known locally as Shasha, lives in the township of Khuma that was close to the disused mine in Stilfontein. The 36-year-old, who had served seven years in prison for robbery, volunteered to go down to help with the rescue effort.",
      "\"I'm being rehabilitated by the correctional services and I volunteered because people in our community were seeking help for their children and brothers.",
      "\"The rescue company said they didn't have anyone who wanted to go down. So my friend Mandla and I agreed to volunteer so we could help our brothers to resurface and bring up the dead bodies.\"",
      "But even though he wanted to help, the 25-minute journey down the 2km (1.2 mile)-deep shaft filled him with terror.",
      "The crane would occasionally stop and start, leaving him dangling in the darkness. Once he got down into the mine, he was shocked by what he saw.",
      "\"There were lots of bodies, over 70 bodies, and around 200 or so people that were dehydrated.",
      "\"I felt very weak when I saw them, it was a painful thing to see. But Mandla and I decided we needed to be strong and not show them how we felt so we could motivate them.\"",
      "The miners who had been waiting for help for months, gave them a hero's welcome.",
      "\"They were very, very happy,\" he says.",
      "The miners had been stuck there following a nationwide police operation to end illicit mining at disused sites that had closed, as the industry \u2013 once the backbone of the country's economy \u2013 was shrinking.",
      "It was no longer profitable for mining multinationals to operate in many places, but the promise of still finding gold deposits was a magnet for many desperate people \u2013 particularly undocumented migrants.",
      "Thousands of shafts were abandoned.",
      "In November, police stepped up efforts at the Buffelsfontein mine in Stilfontein, surrounding the entrance to the shaft and refusing to let food and water go down.",
      "Before the rescue operation began on Monday, the local community had tried to take matters into their own hands by lowering a rope down the shaft to try and pull out some of the men.",
      "They also sent down messages and told the miners that help was coming.",
      "\"So when we got there, they were already waiting for the crane. Now when they see us, they see us as their presidents, as their messiahs: the people that came from outside into the hole to help them to resurface.\"",
      "The police say the illegal miners were always able to come out on their own but were refusing to do so because they feared arrest. But Mkwayi disagrees: \"It's a lie that people didn't want to come out. Those people were desperate for help, they were dying.\"",
      "While at the mine site on Tuesday, the BBC saw dozens of the rescued men.",
      "They appeared emaciated, their bones visible through their clothes. Some could barely walk and had to be helped by medical staff.",
      "In statements submitted to the high court, the illegal miners describe in graphic details the slow and painful death of their peers. They say many died of starvation.",
      "\"From September through October 2024, the absence of even basic sustenance was absolute, and survival became a daily battle against starvation,\" one miner was recorded as saying.",
      "Mkwayi says the men he rescued were so frail that the rescue cage that is only meant to carry seven healthy adults could take 13 of them.",
      "\"They were very dehydrated and had lost weight so we managed to fit more into the cage, because they wouldn't have survived another two days down in the hole. They would be dead if we didn't get them out as soon as possible.\"",
      "The volunteers were also in charge of bringing up dead bodies.",
      "\"The rescue services gave us bags and told us to put the bodies in them and bring them up in the cage which we did with the help of some of the miners.\"",
      "The rescue operation was initially meant to last at least a week, but after just three days, the volunteers said no-one was left underground.",
      "The authorities sent a camera down the shaft to do a final sweep. They say the mine will now be permanently sealed.",
      "But the experience has deeply impacted Mkwayi.",
      "At one point during the call he asks for a question to be repeated, explaining that his hearing has been affected since going down into the mine, presumably by the pressure.",
      "But the hardest impact has been from what he witnessed.",
      "\"I have to tell you, I am traumatised. I will never forget the sight of these people for the rest of my life.\"",
      "For activists and trade unions helping the community, the death of the 87 people in the mine amounts to a \"massacre\" perpetrated by the authorities.",
      "The use of the emotive word has drawn comparisons with the shooting dead by police of 34 striking miners in Marikana, some 150km (93 miles) away from Stilfontein, in 2012.",
      "But this time no triggers were pulled. Instead it seems many of the men starved to death.",
      "The authorities reject the idea they were responsible.",
      "The government initiated the crackdown on illicit mining in December 2023 through Operation Vala Umgodi (meaning \"close the hole\" in isiZulu).",
      "The abandoned mines had been taken over by gangs, often led by former employees, which sold what was found on the black market.",
      "People were co-opted into this illicit trade, either by force or voluntarily, and made to spend months underground digging for minerals. The government says illegal mining cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn) in 2024 alone.",
      "As part of the police operation, entry points at various disused mines were blocked, along with food and water supplies, in a bid to flush out the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas (which translates as \"take a chance\").",
      "While Vala Umgodi was largely successful in other provinces, the old Buffelsfontein gold mine presented a unique challenge.",
      "Prior to the police operation, most of the miners were only able to get underground through a makeshift pulley system operated by people at the surface.",
      "But they then abandoned the top of the mineshaft when security officials arrived in large numbers in August, leaving those in the mine stranded.",
      "Community members then stepped in to help, pulling a few people up using ropes, but this was a long, arduous process.",
      "Other difficult and dangerous exits were available and in all nearly 2,000 resurfaced - most were arrested and remain in police custody.",
      "Why others did not come out is not clear \u2013 they may have been too weak or were being threatened by gang members in the mine - but they were left in desperate circumstances.",
      "Out of the 87 who died, only two have been identified, police said on Thursday, explaining that the fact that many were undocumented migrants made the process harder.",
      "\"We hold the view that government has blood on its hands,\" Magnificent Mndebele from the Mining Affected Communities United in Action group (Macua), told the BBC.",
      "He argued that the miners were given no warning about what was about to happen before the police operation began.",
      "Over the past two months, Macua has been at the forefront of the various court battles initiated to compel the government to first allow supplies and then undertake a rescue operation.",
      "Its blaming of the government echoes earlier statements from families who had said that the authorities had killed their loved ones.",
      "They had taken a hard line since the operation intensified. In November, one minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, made the now infamous statement during a press briefing that they were going to \"smoke them out\".",
      "The state refused to allow food to be sent down or anyone to help retrieve the miners, only caving in after several successful court applications.",
      "In November, small portions of instant maize and water made it down the shaft, but in a court statement, one of the miners said it was not enough for the hundreds of men down below, many of whom were too weak to even chew and swallow them.",
      "More food was delivered in December, but again it could not sustain the men.",
      "Given that the operation to bring up the men and bodies lasted just three days, what is hard for Mr Mndebele to understand is why this could not have been done sooner, when it was clear there was an issue.",
      "\"We're disappointed by our government, frankly put, because this help has come too late.\"",
      "While the government is yet to formally respond to these accusations, police have vowed to continue with the wider operations to clear the country's disused mines until May this year.",
      "Speaking to journalists in Stilfontein on Tuesday, Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe was unapologetic. He said the government would intensify the fight against illegal mining, which he labelled a crime and an \"attack on the economy\".",
      "On Thursday, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was a little more conciliatory.",
      "\"I do understand and accept that this is an emotional issue. Everyone wants to judge\u2026 but it would help all of us as South Africans to wait until pathologists have done and completed their job,\" he said.",
      "The police have defended their actions, saying providing the miners with food would have \"allowed criminality to thrive\".",
      "Illegal miners have been accused of fostering criminality in the communities where they operate.",
      "A number of stories have been published in local media linking the zama zamas to various rapes and murders.",
      "But for Mkwayi, who put his own safety on the line to help the miners, the men in the Stilfontein mine were just trying to make a living.",
      "\"People went down 2km with a rope and risked their lives to put food on the table for their families.\"",
      "He said he wants the government to give licences to artisanal miners who are forced to go into disused mines due to South Africa's high unemployment rate.",
      "\"If your children are hungry, you won't think twice about going down there because you have to feed them. You'll risk your life to put food on the table.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:18:55 -0500",
    "summary": "As the Palisades Fire exploded in his hometown, the actor was moving abandoned cars so emergency vehicles could get through. He spoke about the importance of making a difference; and about caring for his late father, Stanley, whom he calls his \"anchor.\"",
    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "It was the tail end of June 1968; the air was starting to get humid. Fourth grade was ending, and I could feel the three months of delirium that was coming.",
      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",
      "And wouldn't you know it? Someone noticed.",
      "\"What the hell is going on?\" I heard my mother say downstairs. \"Stanley, I smell smoke.\"",
      "\"Check the air conditioners,\" my father said. \"I'm going to look at the attic.\"",
      "I heard my father's footsteps as he rushed up to the attic, praying that he would skip past the bathroom I'd turned into my private gunpowder studio. But then he started banging on the door.",
      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",
      "He reached into the drawer and, with one giant hand, grabbed the bulk of them.",
      "\"Follow me.\"",
      "We headed outside. I was sure that we were going to the garbage pails, but he walked right past them.",
      "\"You and me are going to light every firecracker in these belts and finish them off.\"",
      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",
      "\"That's it, Steven. We're done. Good job.\"",
      "I walked back into the house a little changed. A little more trust from my dad. A little bit more like a man.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also represented by the WME agency, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit, and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",

    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

    "summary": "Bob Uecker was the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame.",
    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court had ordered the Biden administration to take action over fluoride's potential health risks at higher levels.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",
      "Fluoridation opponents argue that modern toothpaste is enough to make up for stopping water fluoridation, citing communities that do not add the chemical to their water supply.",
      "Not all local governments have stuck with their decision to stop fluoridating water. In Canada, Calgary's city council decided to reintroduce fluoride after cavity rates worsened in children.",
      "\"I hope this is sufficiently convincing to the leadership in the city of Calgary, Alberta, that they see the harm that stopping fluoridation has happened to the children of their city,\" said University of California San Francisco Professor Howard Pollick, in a post by the American Dental Association in 2021, after a study on higher cavity rates in the city.",

      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",
      "Which food brands have Red 3 in their products?",
      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",

      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory earlier this month calling for a warning about the risk of cancer to be included on alcoholic beverages.",
      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

    "summary": "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to finalize the rule on food labels.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",

    "summary": "Billionaires' wealth soared in 2024, a top anti-poverty group said ahead of an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland of some of the world's political and financial elite.",
    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets.",
      "Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:06:30 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",

      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:04:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously found the new law that could lead to a ban of TikTok does not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat.",
      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear. Following the ruling, the White House said the Biden administration would not enforce the ban on Sunday, and would leave it to the Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that he would make his \"decision on TikTok\" in \"the not too distant future,\" but that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",
      "\"I had a very good experience with TikTok,\" he said.",
      "Chew, the TikTok CEO,\u00a0met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida resort, in December, and is expected to attend the president-elect's inauguration Monday.",

Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",

      "\"You're just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it's okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\" said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",

      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation's children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\" said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Dangerous conditions",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following\u00a0the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\"The Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\" the Department said.",
      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",

    "summary": "Some Walmart shareholders say the retailer hasn't offered a good business case for canceling its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of shareholders representing $266 billion in assets are calling on Walmart to spell out the business reasons for backpedaling on the retailer's\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Investors including Amalgamated Bank and Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids said Tuesday in a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that they are \"concerned to see our company give into bullying and pressure from anti-DEI groups.\"",
      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",
      "Organized by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition that seeks to influence corporate behavior, the investors requested a meeting with Walmart leaders about the change in policy, noting they had for decades supplied data illustrating the business hazards linked to discrimination and inequity.",
      "\"Seeing the company retreat from its stated values and the business opportunities associated with a diverse and inclusive workforce is very disheartening. Additionally, Walmart has not offered a financial or business case for this change in policy,\" the investors wrote.",
      "Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The letter coincides with\u00a0another by a coalition of 14 attorneys general also\u00a0voicing concerns about Walmart's DEI announcement, made weeks after the November win at the polls by President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal opponent of DEI policies.",
      "Other companies have also moved to unwind their DEI efforts in recent weeks. Meta last week said it would pull the plug on its DEI programs, joining other corporate giants to make the move, including\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald's. The retrenchment accelerated in 2023 after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions, a decision that emboldened anti-DEI activists.",
      "Other large companies to shut down their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "Still, mamor companies including \u00a0Apple, Costco and\u00a0Target\u00a0continue to support their DEI policies. Target, for instance, is defending against itself in court against a conservative advocacy group's lawsuit\u00a0claiming\u00a0the retailer misled investors about the alleged financial risks stemming from its DEI practices.",

    "summary": "Scott Bessent, tapped by Donald Trump to be treasury secretary, faced sharp questions from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

      "After a historic vote on Wednesday, women's teams will now receive \"performance units\" for every game they play in the NCAA Tournament. Met with a round of applause at the NCAA's convention in Nashville, Tennessee, the unanimous vote was the final buzzer-beater in establishing a pay structure for women competing in March Madness.",
      "The change comes as men's basketball teams have been a part of revenue-sharing plans for years. But with a surge in popularity surrounding women's basketball, the NCAA's Board of Governors voted unanimously for the proposal in August. Wednesday's vote solidified the details.",
      "Starting in the 2025 season, a combined $15 million will be awarded to the teams, which makes up 26% of the women's basketball media revenue deal. It will increase to $20 million for the 2026-27 fiscal year and reach $25 million starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",
      "\"This is a historic day for women's sports, women's basketball and the NCAA,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"We have made investing in women's sports a priority, and today's vote means our members have the opportunity to do even more on campus to promote and support female athletes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",

It also outdrew the men's national championship game by 3 million viewers.",
      "Viewing records were set across all six rounds as fans watched outstanding players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark take on South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and the undefeated Gamecocks. Other players who contributed to the boost in viewership were LSU's Angel Reese, USC's JuJu Watkins and UConn's Paige Bueckers.",
      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",
      "\"It's capitalizing on the momentum that's out there,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a statement that they made today about where women's basketball fits into the big picture of college athletics.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:10:56 -0500",
    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:59:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Insurance companies are canceling homeowner policies across the U.S. \u2014 even in regions that aren't considered climate hot spots.",
    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

      "The cooler-than-expected core CPI data reassured Wall Street that inflation isn't on a renewed upward trend, according to economists at High Frequency Economics in a research note. Stock gained on Wednesday morning, with the S&P 500 rising 95 points, or 1.6%, to 5,937 in early trading.",
      "\"There surely is no evidence of either a crash in prices \u2014 as one might expect to see in a crashing economy \u2014 or a renewal of upward pressure on prices,\" they wrote.",
      "Signs that underlying inflation pressures are easing sent stocks rocketing higher on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 703 points, or 1.7%, to close at 43,221, while the S&P 500 gained 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 2.5%.",
      "Given the mixed inflation data, some economists predicted the Fed is likely to hold off on a rate hike at its Jan. 29 meeting, although they added that the improvement in the core CPI bolsters the possibility of cuts later in 2025.",
      "\"After recent red-hot data, today's softer-than-expected core CPI reading should help cool fears of a reacceleration in inflation,\" said Tina Adatia, head of fixed income client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"While today's release is likely insufficient to put a January rate cut back on the table, it strengthens the case that the Fed's cutting cycle has not yet run its course.\"",
      "At the same time, economists are expressing concern about the incoming Trump administration's economic plans \u2014 a mix of new tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations \u2014 which they say could reignite inflation.",
      "That could come as consumers are continuing to feel the pinch of higher costs. Prices in December accelerated due to higher gasoline prices, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing, according to the report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "While Wall Street is interpreting the December report favorably, the CPI report signals \"little relief to most consumers,\" noted David Royal, chief financial and investment officer at financial services company Thrivent, in an email. \"Food prices, which had been tame in the first half of 2024, continued their acceleration, increasing 0.3% in December.\"",
      "He added, \"[T]he increases in prices of items closely watched by consumers could continue to be a drag on consumer confidence, which has already shown weakness on inflation concerns.\"",

    "summary": "Billionaires' wealth soared in 2024, a top anti-poverty group said ahead of an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland of some of the world's political and financial elite.",
    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets.",
      "Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday.",

I can't emphasize enough though, Margaret, on the border, the American people gave him a clear mandate, lock down our border, deport the worst of the worst, take on the cartels. We cannot have a situation where we have paramilitary gangs that are shooting down aircraft with heavy weapons, controlling 30 percent of our neighbor Mexico and controlling whole swathes of our border.",

It was to allow Americans to use it, but then to make it safe from Chinese Communist Party interference.",

      "Look, I know they're alive. I'm sure they are in \u2013 that they've been held in deplorable conditions over 470 days, but the Israelis have a very good system to take them into their care, and they're going to get the care they need and be reunited with their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It appeared that, even up until this morning, it was in question whether Hamas was going to go through with this. The Israelis said they hadn't handed over the names of the captives.",

      "BRETT MCGURK: Well, look, this deal was negotiated over a year, for good reason.",
      "It's a detailed, complex arrangement to leave nothing to chance. And even up to last night, I was up until 4:00 in the morning, when this finally went into place, to make sure that everything went according to the plan. Hamas owed the list of the three names. That had to happen for the cease- fire to go into effect.",
      "That was delayed a couple hours. It eventually happened, and now we have the news today. You have a full cease-fire in effect in Gaza. You have about 800 trucks of aid getting into Gaza today. And you have had\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eight hundred?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Eight hundred trucks of aid should reach Gaza today. And you've had the three girls now, again, reunited, hopefully with their families, and they're now in Israeli custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.N. says an average of 72 trucks per day went in, in December, and that's been the case in January. Is there even the capacity for the Israelis to search these trucks and allow in that food? Do you expect 800 trucks to make it into Gaza today?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: That's why \u2013 that's why I have been in the Middle East for the last month nonstop to make sure everything is ready to go. This was not put together in the last week. This has been put together really since May, when President Biden laid out this framework.",
      "He developed this framework with the emir of Qatar and with the president of Egypt, President Sisi. He announced it to the world in May. It was unanimously endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. We thought we were close in August, Margaret, and then we had six hostages killed in a tunnel underneath Rafah.",
      "I was just in your green room talking to the mother \u2013 or speaking with the mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed tragically in August. It was that incident in August, when Hamas killed those hostages, that we decided to flip the script. There was not a deal because Hamas would not agree to release hostages.",
      "We supported the Israelis in going after Hezbollah. They took out Hezbollah. That\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In Lebanon.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: In Lebanon.",
      "We have a cease-fire in Lebanon. We have a new government in Lebanon. That isolated Hamas. Iran is in the weakest position it's been in the Middle East in decades. So, when we went back to the table in December, Hamas, for the first time, for the first time, was ready to accept the May framework and begin to release hostages.",
      "It wasn't until early January that they actually approved the hostage list, and that's how we got to the result today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do we know, Keith Siegel, Sagui Chen, and Edan Alexander, how they're doing?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Keith will come out in phase one. Sagui will come out in phase one. Edan was a uniformed Israeli soldier. He is phase two. But we are committed.",
      "And I think you just heard this from Mike Waltz, and we've been working seamlessly with the incoming team. I think this is a testament to President Biden and to President Trump, allowing us to work together. I worked with Steve Witkoff over the last week, again, a partnership, I think historic, to help get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump's envoy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu described this overnight as a temporary cease-fire. And he says he has permission to begin fighting as needed.",
      "Do you believe he sees this as just a strategic pause, or that he actually wants to end this war?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: The way the deal is structured, on day 16, the negotiations begin for phase two. Phase two will begin a negotiation for the exchange of soldiers to Palestinian prisoners.",
      "But, also, the conditions have to be set for phase two, and we support the Israelis in making sure those conditions are set, so Hamas can never come back to power in Gaza, Hamas can never again threaten Israel from Gaza.",
      "Those conditions have to be set. We in the Biden administration have been very clear. We want to see this \u2013 this deal reached, all three phases, every hostage come home. I think the Trump administration very much shares that objective. And the template, the road map, again, that the president set out in May, this was the road map ultimately to ending the war, getting everybody home, is the only way to do it.",
      "That road map is now in place. We have a cease-fire today in Gaza, and we have a good chance to get every hostage home, and we have got to do everything we can to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Hamas, according to Secretary Blinken, has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost over the course of this war. Blinken said that this week.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Hamas has been significantly decimated. Its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed in October. Without that, we would not be at this deal.",
      "Hamas on October 7 was an organized military formation. It invaded Israel with 3,500 troops in military formations, combat brigades. It is now no longer able to do that. It does not have military capacity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that argues that Israel has done something that may backfire on them, in terms of the humanitarian situation that has allowed Hamas not to lose support, but to continue to recruit.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: To get the \u2013 I \u2013 I worked closely with my Israeli colleagues. I spent hours with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is a deal that he fully supports. They agree. There's a moral debt to these hostages. You have to get them out.",
      "And Israel is also going to make sure that it protects its national security. And we're going to make sure we do that. You know, Margaret, we got this deal without that wider Middle East war that everybody was predicting. Americans did not get drawn into a wider Middle East war.",
      "We defended Israel from Iranian missiles. We supported Israel going after Hezbollah. We supported Israel going after Hamas. We have defanged Iran's proxy networks around the region, and that led to the isolation of Hamas to actually get this deal today. That's how we got to this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

You carpet bombed - not his exact words, but you carpet bombed Berlin. You dropped a nuclear weapon. You killed thousands of innocent people, because you had to in order to win a war.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, President Biden went on to say, that's why the entire U.N. and international order was created, to stop that from ever happening again.",
      "How much do you think Israel's standing in the world has been damaged by the conduct of its military?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: (White House National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa): Well, Margaret, that was a conversation early on when the debate was whether or not the Israelis should go in on the ground. And we had a debate with them about that. Ultimately, we supported them, and they were right because Hamas was living in 400 miles of tunnels underneath Gaza. There was no way to root out Hamas without going into Gaza. And, frankly, you can see -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he was talking about dropping bombs on buildings.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: But you can see Hamas - but I'm just going back to what the conversation was about. It was about how this was going to go. And look, we have worked very closely with the Israelis. Too many people have died in this war. That's why we're - we worked so hard to get to where we are today with a ceasefire. The ceasefire today, this framework, the roadmap the president laid out in May, was the only way to end the war. And the only way to end the war was, frankly, with massive pressure on Hamas and knocking out the other proxies that were supporting Hamas.",
      "I just have to emphasize this again, when Hezbollah was firing on Israel every single day, it was Hassan Nasrallah's position that they would not stop shooting on Israel and making northern Israel a no man's land until - until Israel accepted all of Hamas' terms in Gaza. Israel had to knock out Hezbollah to get this deal. That's what happened with a ceasefire at the end of November. That's what opened up the space to get this deal.",
      "It's been a brutal war, but to end it we get we had to get the ceasefire deal. And to do that, to do that, we had to support Israel and back them up, and we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if this ceasefire becomes an end to the war, and there's more diplomacy ahead.",

Let me just say this, these people would not be coming out if Donald Trump had not demanded they'd be out. Everything Brett said about pressure on Hamas and Iran is true, but the game changer, when Trump said, I want them out or all hell will be to pay.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm going to - I'm going to urge the decimation of the Iranian nuclear program. I don't think diplomacy works. Brett will tell you what they have done to Hezbollah and Hamas has been amazing. The proxies are incredibly weakened. Israel can go anywhere they want to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "Do you have a top line number yet on how much this is all going to cost?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, $100 billion for border security through reconciliation would be enough to hire ICE agents, create new detention beds, and finish the wall and put technology in place over four years. $200 billion will be given to the military to make it more capable of deterring China. $100 billion for border. $200 billion for the military.",
      "I met with Mike Johnson yesterday. He is a dear friend. I admire him greatly. He has a political problem in the House. He wants to - to do one big, beautiful bill. I have never been more worried about an attack on our homeland than I am now with the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan and wars all over the world. I think the number one priority for the Republican Party should be to secure that border. You need new money to do it. And if we don't, we're playing Russian roulette with our own national security.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You need to secure that border like our life depended on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this bill is going to be bigger than the $300 billion you just laid out.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the timetable on that, because Johnson says Memorial Day.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I hope we can get there, but to those who want to reduce spending, I'm giving you an opportunity to come meet me next week. You've got to cut spending that's (ph) reconciliation compliant, and we've got enough votes to reduce spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, can we do $2.5 trillion over ten years? Let's give it a try.",
      "I want to do two things, cut spending and make the tax cuts permanent. The secretary of Treasury, Steve Bessent, said, if the tax cut expires, it will be a catastrophe for our economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't believe there's one Republican out there, if they were pushed, would let the tax cuts expire, because that's a $4.5 trillion tax increase. I want to cut spending, but my number one priority is to secure that border quickly.",

In his 2022 memoire, Bill Barr said of Kash Patel, \"he's someone with no background as an agent, would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau. He has virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency. The idea of moving him into a role like this showed a shocking detachment from reality.\"",
      "Was Attorney General Barr wrong then and wrong now?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I disagree with that. Yes, he was wrong then and he's wrong now. And I take my advice on Kash Patel from Trey Gowdy, dear friend from South Carolina, who worked with Kash. Kash was a public defender. He was a prosecutor. He worked with Trey Gowdy about the Russia hoax. So, I do think he has the experience. He has the trust of the president. And we'll see how this plays out. But Trey Gowdy is enthusiastically supporting Kash Patel, and that means a lot to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well - well, OK. But he's got a list he's published, Kash Patel has. He published it in a book of - of enemies. It includes people like the FBI director, Defense Secretary Austin, Bill Barr, former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, former CIA Director Gina Haskell, the head of CENTCOM.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, we're going to - well - yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, do you take him at his word here that - that these are an enemies list and you're going to put him in a law enforcement role to go after him?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I - I believe the hearing will expose him to be a very qualified man of the law. He wrote a book. He'll have to answer questions about what's in the book. But I'm ready to vote for him because I know him, too. See, he never asked me about the Russia hoax that he exposed. People on the right believe that he was part of the solution, not the problem.",
      "You asked a good question of Brett, has Israel suffered because of this war, they went too far, on the world stage? Here's what's happened on the world stage. The International Criminal Court is going to be sanctioned by the Congress -",

      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do. He visited my office before the hearing. He did very well at the hearing. And I think we are likely to act on day one and he'll get a strong, bipartisan vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to some of the other picks, Democrats have very little say, frankly, because Republicans have this 53-seat majority, so they don't need Democratic votes. You sharply questioned Pete Hegseth this past week, who is the pick to run the Pentagon. You asked about his willingness to break oaths, having cheated on his second wife and the mother of a child born two months before when he had told police he was having consensual sex with a woman in Monterey, California, who filed a claim of sexual assault and he filed a financial settlement.",
      "Why did you choose to put that issue of character so front and center instead of asking him about policies?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: The - I - I believe he would be a very dangerous secretary of defense. And so my observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit. That's why Matt Gaetz withdrew, because the Senate Republicans felt, on both of those counts, he was a non-starter.",
      "I believe my questions of Pete Hegseth about his serial infidelity, about the allegation of sexual assault that he refused to disclose to President- elect Trump and the transition team and his own mother's allegation that he's a serial abuser of women. I think those are the kinds of things that might affect how Republicans view this. If not in the committee, possibly on the floor.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, which is not liberal by any anyone's definition, said, \"Hegseth made noises about restoring U.S. military deterrents, that's something, but appears we're on track to have a secretary of defense whose real views are a mystery.\"",
      "Wasn't it also important to hear what his plans are for China and the like, because it looks like he is going to sail through if Republican leadership can keep Republicans in line and get them all to deliver the votes they need?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I - and, Margaret, I think they - if you look at the entire hearing, a number of his views were put on the table. I had seven minutes. It was so unusual to have a secretary of defense nominee refuse to even meet with any of the Democratic members of the committee, except for the chairman.",
      "RFK has met with Democratic members. The secretary of labor nominee, secretary of army, secretary of navy, secretary of state, they're all meeting with the Democratic members of the committee. But when he refused to meet with us, and you only have seven minutes, we divided up topics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I asked him about what I consider to be glaring faults of character. Other members of the committee asked him about positions on strategy, the role of women in combat, whether he is qualified to run an organization of the size of the Pentagon. I think overall in the hearing we put a lot of material on the table for folks to consider.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about immigration. You're a former governor. Incoming border czar Tom Homan has said that there will be massive deportation raids beginning as soon as Mr. Trump takes office. There are just about 300,000 undocumented individuals believed to be living in your state according to Pew Research. And I know your current governor, Youngkin, has pledged to fully support efforts through state law enforcement or the National Guard.",
      "How do you think this is going to work?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I don't exactly know how the administration is going to do it, but let me tell you, I'm hearing significant concerns from many sectors in the Virginia economy, agriculture, hospitality, health care, construction, that massive deportation raids would be an absolute gut punch to the Virginia and American economy. And if you add to that the Trump threat of massive tariffs, I think you're going to see a lot of pain for consumers and a lot of pain for employers if they carry through on mass deportation.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration prioritizes criminals in their roundups and deportations. The Trump administration says they're also going to target criminals. Do you think this is going to look different?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, it's - I do think the Biden administration prioritizes criminals who are a public safety risk, who pose a threat of violence. The Trump administration could go much broader than that. You know, looking at folks - I mean, for example, there's a bill that's pending on the - in the Senate right now that would deport people on the basis of an arrest, even if they've not been convicted of anything. A shoplifting arrest. Even if they've not been convicted of anything. A fundamental aspect of our society is that an arrest doesn't mean anything unless there's a conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Because people get arrested all the times for things that they didn't do. So, if the Trump administration says, look, an arrest leads to deportation even without a conviction, yes, it's going to look completely different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

We have 60 trucks waiting in that queue, all loaded up with warm clothing, shoes for kids, pallets with medicines, malnutrition treatment, which is sorely needed. We haven't as yet seen any go in. But that could have happen over the last couple of minutes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What state are these kids in?",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Oh, we - there's estimates that there's about 300,000 children in real acute need of malnutrition treatment. This is not just food, right, this is a medical treatment to make sure that they don't get real long-term consequences of their malnutrition, cognitive as well as physical. There are 150,000 pregnant and lactating women inside of Gaza who urgently need micro-nutrients as well to avoid those same consequences. So, the needs are enormous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I read, and this was particularly heartbreaking, that Save the Children is also going to try to connect more than 17,000 separated children to find family members.",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That's right. It's going to be a huge effort. You know, it's a real moment of hope and peril at the same time. We know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that?",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Well, what we'll do is to - we do family tracing. So, we're going to try to find extended family, even - even if no direct parents, extended families, aunts, uncles, nephews, neighbors sometimes, the community where they were, find members from that community, vet them, check backgrounds, and then the painstaking process of reuniting these children who - many of whom have been either displaced or lost or - and some even displaced outside of Gaza, help them reconnect to that community. A lot of mental health, psychosocial support, cash to make sure that that family's also able to - to care for them, in already a situation of where they've - most of them will have lost everything.",

We have 250 - a workforce of 250 Palestinians in Gaza who have been at it for 15 months. They are exhausted. They - they also need to get back to their - whatever is left of their homes. We urgently need to be able to surge in adequate capacity and specialism.",

      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That is going to be problematic. The operational infrastructure from UNRWA is - is massive. We've said that now for 15 months. All of us are humanitarian agencies cannot replace UNRWA just like that. If ever. Thirteen thousand UNRWA staff inside of Gaza where -",

      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key ally of President-elect Donald Trump on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that he plans to support Kash Patel, Trump's pick to lead the FBI who has sparked controversy even among some officials from Trump's first term.",
      "\"I am ready to vote for Kash Patel,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Patel is expected to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks, though his hearing has yet to be scheduled while Senate Republicans are working to quickly approve Trump's pick for top posts in his administration. But his selection may be considered among the most contentious.",
      "Patel, 44, served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. The staunch Trump loyalist rose to prominence for his role in fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and later as key ally of Trump's as he tried to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "Former Attorney General William Barr, who worked under the Trump administration, wrote about the possible nomination of Patel for the FBI post in his memoir, saying Patel \"has virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency\" and that the \"idea of moving Patel into a rule like this showed a shocking detachment from reality.\"",
      "Graham said he disagreed with Barr's sentiment, saying he was \"wrong then and he's wrong now.\"",
      "\"Kash was a public defender. He was a prosecutor,\" Graham said. \"So I do think he has the experience, he has the trust of the president, and we'll see how this plays out.",
      "Graham said he takes his advice on Patel from former Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who worked with Patel.",
      "\"Trey Gowdy is enthusiastically supporting Kash Patel, and that means a lot to me,\" Graham said.",
      "Patel, who has been critical of current federal officials, has sparked controversy for including in his book a list known as the \"Executive Branch Deep State,\" which some have referred to as an enemies list that he could seek to prosecute as FBI director. Barr is on the list, as are Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Biden, among many others.",
      "Graham said Patel will have to answer questions during his confirmation hearing about what's in the book, but he said that \"I believe the hearing will expose him to be a very qualified man of the law.\"",
      "FBI director Christopher Wray announced last month that he will resign at the end of the Biden administration, though his term was set to end in 2027. Even prior to Wray's announcement, Trump had announced his intention to install Patel at the helm of the FBI.",
      "Although Graham wouldn't commit to backing Patel \"no matter what,\" he said he is ready to vote for him \"because you will never ask me the role he played in exposing the darkest moment of the FBI since J. Edgar Hoover.\"",
      "In response, Brennan said Graham should ask Patel about \"going after journalists, which he's also said.\" Graham answered \"I'm sure our Democratic friends will ask him.\"",

      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Not as of 10 minutes ago, Margaret, we have 60 trucks waiting in that queue, all loaded up with warm clothing, shoes for kids, pallets with medicines, malnutrition treatment, which is sorely needed. We haven't, as yet, seen any go in, but that could have happened over the last couple of minutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's incredibly difficult just to get in through the security screenings. I think the peak has been 200 or so trucks per day. So to scale up to 800 is pretty incredible, if they can pull that off. But when- when I look at some of these statistics, they are just, just jaw dropping. 1.1 million kids in Gaza, half the population, need food. Their urgent need, surviving on one meal a day after 15 months of war. What state are these kids in?",
      "SOERIPTO: Oh, we- there's estimates that there's about 300,000 children in real acute need of malnutrition treatment. This is not just food, right? This is a medical treatment to make sure that they don't get real long-term consequences of their malnutrition, cognitive as well as physical. There are 150,000 pregnant and lactating women inside of Gaza who urgently need micronutrient- nutrients as well to avoid those same consequences. So the needs are enormous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I read, and this was particularly heartbreaking, that Save the Children is also going to try to connect more than 17,000 separated children to find family members.",
      "SOERIPTO: That's right, it's going to be a huge effort. You know, It's a real moment of hope and peril at the same time. We know\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that?",
      "SOERIPTO: Well, what we'll do is to- we do family tracing. So we're going to try to find extended family even- even if not direct parents, extended families, aunts, uncles, nephews, neighbors, sometimes the community where they were, find members from that community, vet them, check backgrounds, and then the painstaking process of reuniting these children, who many of whom have been either displaced or lost or and some even displaced outside of Gaza, help them reconnect to that community. Lot of mental health, psychosocial support, cash to make sure that the family is also able to care for them in already a situation of- where they most of them will have lost everything. So it's a long and hard, painstaking process that also needs real sensitive and professional social workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When Will those professionals be able to get in?",
      "SOERIPTO: Well, we hope, as soon as possible\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In phase one?",
      "SOERIPTO: In- that is the real ask and hope\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the next six weeks.",
      "SOERIPTO: \u2013We need urgently to get in pediatric medical workers. We need those social workers in the case management workers for to protect children. We need a refreshment. We have two- a workforce of 250 Palestinians in Gaza who've been at it for 15 months. They are exhausted. They also need to get back to their, whatever's left of their homes. We originally need to be able to surge in adequate capacity and specialism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Hamas is not going to govern Gaza. They're not governing Gaza now. It's- it's largely chaos. How, practically speaking, can you get all these things done if, as is now Israeli law, the largest organization, UNRWA, is now going to be banned if the UN can't do this through the UNRWA, who does this?",
      "SOERIPTO: That is going to be problematic. The operational infrastructure from UNRWA is massive, and we've said that now for 15 months, all of us, our humanitarian agencies, cannot replace UNRWA just like that, if ever. 13,000 UNRWA staff inside of Gaza\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Schools.",
      "SOERIPTO: \u2013schools, warehouses, trucks, everything that are being used also by organizations like ours, so that will be difficult, and we would hope that there will be certain exemptions to allow for that operational effectiveness to happen.",

Senator Rubio is expected to be swiftly confirmed as Secretary of State. You expect him in on day one?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I do. He visited my office before the hearing. He did very well at the hearing, and I think we are likely to act on day one, and he'll get a strong bipartisan vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to some of the other picks, Democrats have very little say, frankly, because Republicans have this 53 seat majority, so they don't need Democratic votes. You sharply questioned Pete Hegseth this past week, who is the pick to run the Pentagon. You asked about his willingness to break oaths, having cheated on his second wife and the mother of a child born two months before, when he had told police he was having consensual sex with a woman in Monterey, California who filed a claim of sexual assault- assault and he filed a financial settlement. Why did you choose to put that issue of character so front and center instead of asking him about policies?",
      "SEN. KAINE: The- I believe he would be a very dangerous Secretary of Defense, and so my observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit. That's why Matt Gaetz withdrew, because the Senate Republicans felt, on both of those counts, he was a non-starter. I believe my questions of Pete Hegseth about his serial infidelity, about the allegation of sexual assault that he refused to disclose to President-elect Trump and the transition team, and his own mother's allegation that he's a serial abuser of women, I think those are the kinds of things that might affect how Republicans view this, if not in the committee, possibly on the floor. We'll see. I think there's likely to be committee action as early as late tomorrow, in the Armed Services Committee. We'll see when there's action on the floor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To actually confirm him. The Wall Street Journal editorial board, which is not liberal by anyone's definition, said \"Hegseth made noises about restoring U.S. military deterrence, and that's something. But it appears we're on track to have a secretary of Defense whose real views are a mystery.\" Wasn't it also important to hear what his plans are for China and the like? Because it looks like he is going to sail through if Republican leadership can keep Republicans in line and get them all to deliver the votes they need.",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well I- and Margaret, I think that if you look at the entire hearing, a number of his views were heard on the table. I had seven minutes. It was so unusual to have a Secretary of Defense nominee refuse to even meet with any of the Democratic members of the committee, except for the chairman. RFK has met with Democratic members, the Secretary of Labor nominee, Secretary of Army, Secretary of Navy, Secretary of State. They're all meeting with the Democratic members of the committee. But when he refused to meet with us, and you only have seven minutes, we divided up topics. I asked him about what I consider to be glaring faults of character. Other members on the committee asked him about positions on strategy, the role of women in combat, whether he is qualified to run an organization of the size of the Pentagon. I think overall, in the hearing, we put a lot of material on the table for folks to consider.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about immigration. You're a former governor. Incoming border czar, Tom Homan, has said that there will be massive deportation raids beginning as soon as Mr. Trump takes office. There are just about 300,000 undocumented individuals believed to be living in your state, according to Pew Research. And I know your current governor, Youngkin, has pledged to fully support efforts through state law enforcement or the National Guard. How do you think this is going to work?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I don't exactly know how the administration is going to do it. But let me tell you, I'm hearing significant concerns from many sectors in the Virginia economy, agriculture, hospitality, health care, construction, that massive deportation rates would be an absolute gut punch to the Virginia and American economy. And if you add to that the Trump threat of massive tariffs, I think you're- you're going to see a lot of pain for consumers and a lot of pain for employers if they carry through on mass deportation. Now look, you've got a president who says a lot of things and then chooses not to do them, so I don't know exactly what this is going to look like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. KAINE: But I would say that the economy of Virginia and the economy of this country is going to suffer through deporta- mass deportations and tariffs, if they go forward with what the President has said he will do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Biden administration prioritizes criminals in their roundups and deportations. The Trump administration says they're also going to target criminals. Do you think this is going to look different?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, it's- I do think the Biden administration prioritizes criminals who are a public safety risk, who threat- pose a threat of violence. The Trump administration could go much broader than that. You know, looking at folks- I mean, for example, there's a bill that's pending in the Senate right now that would deport people on the basis of an arrest even if they've not been convicted of anything. A shop like- lifting arrest, even if they've not been convicted of anything. A fundamental aspect of our society is that an arrest doesn't mean anything unless there's a conviction, because people get arrested all the time for things that they didn't do. So if the Trump administration says, look, an arrest leads to deportation even without a conviction, yep, it's going to look completely different, completely different than what the policy has been during the Biden administration.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Seneca, South Carolina. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you are supportive of this ceasefire and Mike Waltz's pledge to see it through?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. I very much appreciate what Brett and Steve Witkoff have done. Let me just say this, these people would not be coming out if Donald Trump had not demanded they be out. Everything Brett said about pressure on Hamas and Iran is true, but the game changer of when Trump said, I want them out, all hell will be to pay. Now here's what I'm hoping, they come out, the deal holds, but what does the end of the war look like? I want to reinforce something to you, this war will never end with Hamas in charge of Gaza\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --politically or militarily. Their days are numbered. And the next question for the world is, what do we do about the Iran nuclear program? That's where we're going to move to next. There's diplomacy. There's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. There's a 90% chance you'll degrade it through military action by Israel, supported by the United States. So the next topic I will be engaging in with President Trump is to take this moment in time to decimate the Iran nuclear program because they're so exposed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --What does that mean?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Help Israel deliver a knockout blow\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: \u00a0It means giving Israel the capabilities--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? You're going to urge him to have Israel bomb Iran's facilities that are underground and that will require U.S. military support to actually have be effective?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I'm going to urge the decimation of the Iranian nuclear program. I don't think diplomacy works. Brett will tell you what they have done to Hezbollah and Hamas has been amazing. The proxies are incredibly weakened. Israel can go anywhere they want to go. This is a relig- religious Nazi regime. They want to destroy the Jewish state. They want to purify Islam and drive us out of the Mideast. It would be like negotiating with Hitler. I am hoping there will be an effort by Israel to decimate the Iran nuclear program supported by the United States, and if we don't do that, it will be a historical mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey Graham, I have a lot to get to on the domestic front, but that is quite a marker to lay down. I want to ask you about what you are working on domestically with Stephen Miller, Trump's Homeland Security Advisor--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On border security, and I understand its part of the massive Republican reconciliation bill that's being put together. Do you have a top line number yet on how much this is all going to cost?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, $100 billion for border security through reconciliation would be enough to hire ICE agents, create new detention beds and finish the wall and put technology in place over four years. 200 billion will be given to the military to make it more capable of deterring China. 100 billion for border, 200 billion for the military. I met with Mike Johnson yesterday. He's a dear friend. I admire him greatly. He has a political problem in the house. He wants to do one big, beautiful bill. I've never been more worried about an attack on our homeland than I am now, with the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan and wars all over the world, I think the number one priority for the Republican Party should be to secure that border. You need new money to do it, and if we don't, we're playing Russian roulette with our own national security. Border first. Military funding first. Get the tax cuts and spending reductions put together later on. You need to secure that border like our life depended on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this bill is going to be bigger than the $300 billion you just laid out. What's the timetable on that? Because Johnson says--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --it's gonna be a lot bigger--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Memorial Day.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I hope we can get there, but to those who want to reduce spending, I'm giving you an opportunity to come meet me next week. You've got to cut spending. That's reconciliation compliant, and we've got enough votes to reduce spending. So can we do two and a half trillion dollars over 10 yard- 10 years? Let's give it a try. I want to do two things, cut spending and make the tax cuts permanent. The Secretary of Treasury Steve Bessent said, if the tax cut expire, it will be a catastrophe for our economy. I don't believe there's one Republican out there, if they were pushed, would let the tax cuts expire, because that's a four and a half trillion dollar tax increase. I want to cut spending, but my number one priority is to secure that border quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch the politics of the possible with the very complicated Caucus in the House. Let me ask you about the Senate, though, because you are on the Judiciary Committee. Kash Patel, the pick to run the FBI, doesn't even have a hearing scheduled yet. In his 2022 memoir Bill Barr said of Kas Patel, \"he's someone with no background as an agent, would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day to day operations of the Bureau. He has virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level, the world's preeminent law enforcement agency\u2026 The idea of moving him into a role like this showed a shocking detachment from reality.\" Was Attorney General Barr wrong then and wrong now?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, he was wrong then, and he's wrong now. And I take my advice on Kash Patel from Trey Gowdy, dear friend from South Carolina who worked with Kash. Kash was a public defender. He was a prosecutor. He worked with Trey Gowdy about the Russia hoax. So I do think he has the experience. He has the trust of the President, and we'll see how this plays out. But Trey Gowdy is enthusiastically supporting Kash Patel, and that means a lot to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well- okay. But he's got a list he's published Kash Patel has. He published it in a book of enemies. It includes people like the FBI director, Defense Secretary Austin, Bill Barr, former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, former CIA director Gina Haskel, the head of CENTCOM. I mean, do you take him at his word here? That these are an enemy's list and you're going to put him in a law enforcement role to go after him?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I believe the hearing will expose him to be a very qualified man of the law. He wrote a book. He'll have to answer questions about what's in the book, but I'm ready to vote for him, because I know him too. See, you never asked me about the Russia hoax, that he exposed. People on the right believe that he was part of the solution, not the problem. You asked a good question of Brett, has Israel suffered because of this war? They went too far on the world stage. Here's what's happened on the world stage. The International Criminal Court is going to be sanctioned by the Congress Republicans and Democrats because they're trying to prosecute the prime minister of Israel-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- \u00a0Lindsey- Lindsey Graham, this is a far cry from the question about Kash Patel. You took me all the way to Israel from Kash Patel. Are you-",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Yeah lets get back to Kash Patel--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You're committing to vote for him no matter what? --",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Yeah--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You are going to vote for Kash Patel?--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I won't say no matter what. But I- yes, I am ready to vote for Kash Patel, because you will never ask me the role he played in exposing the darkest moment of the FBI since Edgar- J Edgar Hoover. That's why I trust him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Ask him about going after journalists, which he's also said, I'm interested in the answer to that question. We'll be right back--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- I'm sure Democratic friends will ask him. And you shouldn't worry about Kash Patel. You should worry about reporting the news fairly, which you don't do when it comes to everything Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey Graham, your guest on this program because we wanted to hear you out--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM:-- So anyway, thanks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And we welcome you back--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Well good. Thank you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- As we often do, anytime, to legacy media--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- I'll be back. I'll be back.--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn to Brett McGurk, White House National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa. Good to have you here, Brett.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Thanks. Margaret, great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're watching the breaking news. This is a deal you negotiated. What can you tell us about how these three women who have been transferred to the Red Cross are doing? Well,",
      "BRETT MCGURK: I just confirmed with my Israeli counterparts that they're now in Israeli custody. So this has just happened. Look, I know they're alive. I'm sure they are in- they've been held in deplorable conditions over 470 days, but the Israelis have a very good system to take them into their care, and they're going to get the care they need and be reunited with their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It appeared that even up until this morning, it was in question whether Hamas was going to go through with this. The Israelis said they hadn't handed over the names of the captives. Do we- why and do we know much about the well being of the three Americans that are still being held?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Well, look, this deal was negotiated over a year for good reason. It's a detailed, complex arrangement to leave nothing to chance. And even up to last night, I was up until four o'clock in the morning, when this finally went into place to make sure that everything went according to the plan. Hamas owed the list of the three names, that had to happen for the cease fire to go into effect. That was delayed a couple hours. It eventually happened, and now we have the news today. You have a full ceasefire in effect in Gaza. You have about 800 trucks of aid getting into Gaza today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 800?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: 800 trucks of aid should reach Gaza today, and you've had the three girls now, again, reunited, hopefully with their families, and they're now in Israeli custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the UN says an average of 72 trucks per day went in in December, and that's been the case in January. Is there even the capacity for the Israelis to search these trucks and allow in that food. Do you expect 800 trucks to make it into Gaza today?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: That's why I've been in the Middle East for the last month, non-stop to make sure everything is ready to go. This was not put together in the last week. This has been put together, really since May, when President Biden laid out this framework. He developed this framework with the Emir of Qatar and with the president of Egypt, President Sisi, he announced it to the world in May. It was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council. We thought we were close in August, Margaret, and then we had six hostages killed in a tunnel underneath Rafah. I was just in your green room talking to the mother, or speaking with the mother of Hersch Goldberg-Polin, who was killed tragically in August. It was that incident in August when Hamas killed those hostages that we decided to flip the script. There was not a deal, because Hamas would not agree to release hostages. We supported the Israelis in going after Hezbollah. They took out Hezbollah in Lebanon. We have a cease fire in Lebanon. We have a new government in Lebanon. That isolated Hamas. Iran is in the weakest position it's been in the Middle East in decades. So we went back to the table in December, Hamas, for the first time, for the first time, was ready to accept the May framework and begin to release hostages. It wasn't until early January that they actually approved the hostage list, and that's how we got to the result today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do we know Keith Siegel, Sagui Chen and Edan Alexander, how they're doing?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Keith will come out in phase one. Sagui will come out in phase one. Edan was a uniformed Israeli soldier. He is phase two. But we are committed. I think you just heard this from Mike Waltz, and we've been working seamlessly with the incoming team. I think this is a testament to President Biden and to President Trump, allowing us to work together. I worked with Steve Witkoff over the last week, again, a partnership, I think, historic, to help get this done\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump's envoy.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: We are committed- We are committed to getting Edan out as early as possible. I spoke with Adi Alexander, Edan's father, just last night.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Prime Minister Netanyahu described this overnight as a temporary cease fire, and he says he has permission to begin fighting as needed. Do you believe he sees this as just a strategic pause, or that he actually wants to end this war?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: The way the deal is structured, on day 16, the negotiations begin for phase two. Phase two will begin a negotiation for the exchange of soldiers to Palestinian prisoners. But also the conditions have to be set for phase two, and we support the Israelis in making sure those conditions are set so Hamas can never come back to power in Gaza. Hamas can never again threaten Israel from Gaza. Those conditions have to be set. We in the Biden administration, have been very clear. We want to see this- this deal reached all three phases. Every hostage come home. I think the Trump administration very much shares that objective and the template, the road map, again, that the President set out in May, this was the road map, ultimately, to ending the war, getting everybody home is the only way to do it. That road map is now in place. We have a cease fire today in Gaza, and we have a good chance to get every hostage home, and we got to do everything we can to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Hamas, according to Secretary Blinken, has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost over the course of this war. Blinken said that this week.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Hamas has been significantly decimated. Its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed in October. Without that, we would not be at this deal. Hamas on October 7, was an organized military formation. It invaded Israel with 3500 troops in military formations, combat brigades. It is now no longer able to do that. It does not have military capacity\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that argues that Israel has done something that may backfire on them in terms of the humanitarian situation that has allowed Hamas not to lose support, but to continue to recruit.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: To get the\u2013 I- I work closely with my Israeli colleagues. I spent hours with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is a deal that he fully supports. They agree. There's a moral debt to these hostages. You have to get them out. And Israel is also going to make sure that it protects its national security. And we're going to make sure we did that, you know, Margaret, we got this deal without that wider Middle East war that everybody was predicting. Americans did not get drawn into wider Middle East war. We defended Israel from Iranian missiles. We supported Israel going after Hezbollah. We supported Israel going after Hamas. We have defanged Iran's proxy networks around the region, and that led to the isolation of Hamas. To actually get this deal today, that's how we got to this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I have to take a break here. Brett, so don't mean to cut you off, but we will have more questions, but we have to take a quick break. Stay with us.",
      "PART 2:",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Brett McGurk of the National Security Council under President Biden. Brett, I just want to pick up where we left off. Just this past week, President Biden gave one of his last interviews, and he shared a private conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Take a listen to it:",
      "BIDEN SOT: I said, But Bibi, I said, you can't be carpet bombing these communities. And he said to me, Well, you did it. You carpet bomb, not his exact words, but you carpet bombed Berlin. You drafted a nuclear weapon, you killed 1000s of innocent people because you had to in order to win a war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden went on to say, that's why the entire UN and international order was created to stop that from ever happening again. How much do you think Israel's standing in the world has been damaged by the conduct of its military?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Well Margaret, that was a conversation early on, when the debate was whether or not the Israelis should go in on the ground. And we had a debate with them about that. Ultimately, we supported them, and they were right, because Hamas was living in 400 miles of tunnels underneath Gaza. There was no way to root out Hamas without going into Gaza, and frankly\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he was talking about dropping bombs on buildings.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: You can see\u2013 but I'm just going back to what the conversation was about. It was about how this was going to go. And look, we've worked very closely with the Israelis. Too many people have died in this war. That's why we work so hard to get to where we are today with a cease fire. The cease fire today, this framework, this road map the President laid out in May, was the only way to end the war, and the only way to end the war was, frankly, with massive pressure on Hamas and knocking out the other proxies that were supporting Hamas. I just have to emphasize this again, when Hezbollah was firing on Israel every single day, it was Hassan Nasrallah's position that they would not stop shooting at Israel and making Northern Israel no man's land until, until Israel accepted all of Hamas' terms in Gaza. Israel had to knock out Hezbollah to get this deal. That's what happened with the cease fire at the end of November. That's what opened up the space to get this deal. It's been a brutal war, but to end it, we had to get the cease fire deal. And to do that, to do that, we had to support Israel and back them up. And we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see if the ceasefire becomes an end to the war and there's more diplomacy ahead. Brett McGurk, thank you for sharing the details.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Waltz, incoming Trump administration national security adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 19, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by Congressman Mike Waltz. He's the incoming National Security Advisor to President-elect Donald Trump. Good to have you here.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Good to be with you. Thanks",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand just yesterday, you were meeting with the families of some of the hostages being held in Gaza. At least three Americans assessed to still be alive and in captivity. One of them might not be released until phase two, when male soldiers are released and Israeli troops withdraw. Will the Trump team see this through to completion?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, remember the terms of the deal that we finally have come to was inherited in many ways, from the Biden administration. So it was actually the Biden negotiators that were at the table, and the- the other side was dealing with them, but kind of looking to us, particularly Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy. And one of the things that we inherited was this framework of women, the elderly and the sick coming out first. The- one of the Americans is an Israeli soldier. He- that means he'll come out in the second phase, but we will get him out period--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Edan Alexander.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Edan Alexander. And I am convinced, Margaret, that this deal would have never happened had President Trump not been elected.The Trump effect, so to speak, the families believe that they were effusive and their thanks for him and the- in the truth that he put out that put Hamas on notice, that there will be consequences if they don't let our people go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is also obviously the party Israel here\u2013",
      "REP. WALTZ: --Yep--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that feels some pressure to get this done. One far right member of the Netanyahu government resigned. Another this morning said he will bring down the Netanyahu government if it does not return to fighting in a way that leads Israel to taking over the entire Gaza Strip. Does Mr. Trump support annexation of the West Bank and Gaza?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, excuse me, very different things. What we're talking about here is making sure that Hamas is destroyed as a terrorist organization. Hamas is no different than ISIS or Al Qaeda or any of the worst of the worst that has so brutalized the Middle East over the years. And what we have made clear to Bibi Netanyahu, to his government- and I want the Israeli people to hear me loud and clear. If Hamas reneges on this deal, if Hamas backs out, moves the goal post, what have you we will support Israel in doing what it has to do, number one, and number two, Hamas will never govern Gaza. That is completely unacceptable, because they've made their intention clear, which is to destroy Israel and to have future October 7s. So I understand the concern, but at the end of the day, Prime Minister Netanyahu supported this deal. He agreed we needed to get those hostages out, and within the next 24 hours, we will see- we will see three women coming out alive and hugging their families. And had we not entered this, these people would have died, Margaret. I mean these conditions that they were in- by the way, they've been held now longer than the hostages in 1979 in the Iranian hostage crisis. They were being brutalized, raped, tortured. It was horrific, but now we're going to have a Reagan moment. We are going to have President Trump being sworn in as hostages are coming out alive, and that's something we should all celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also said, though, that you want to build on this to eventually get peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, normalization.",
      "REP. WALTZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The price of that is recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Saudi Arabia. Does Mr. Trump support a two-state solution? Hamas doesn't want two states. The far right in Israel doesn't want two states. Does Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, President Trump's plan and his first term, his plan for the Middle East and his plan for Israel and Palestine had a pathway to a two-state with all kinds of very important qualifiers that had to be in place beforehand. Stop radicalizing the next generation of Palestinian youth. Very specifics- components of that plan in terms of how things would be divided up, but I do think we can get to the next round of the Abraham accords. We- I do think we can expand it, and that will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which will be tremendous. That has been a main goal of the Netanyahu government now for years. And Margaret, I can tell you, for President Trump, if in a short amount of time, if we're talking about infrastructure projects, ports, rails, fiber, data center, if we're talking about all of those things, these historic animosities will become smaller and smaller and smaller, and that is the piece that he seeks, and that only he can lead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Mr. Huckabee, the possible future ambassador to Israel, is wrong when he says that Mr. Trump does not believe in a two state solution in the future?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, I've spoken\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- he said that yesterday on Fox News\u2013",
      "REP. WALTZ: -- yeah, no, I've spoken to him, and it's- it's how do we eventually get there, right? And what we eventually want is the Abraham Accords and that next round, right? And there is a lot of room. Both can be true. We are going to protect Israel. We are going to make sure that they are defended. But eventually we're going to come to some accommodation that Saudi Arabia is comfortable in entering into that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To lead to a Palestinian state. That's what they're asking\u2013",
      "REP. WALTZ: --well, we'll see exactly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --a process--",
      "REP. WALTZ: --what that looks like. That process is going to- is going to be long. And what, you know, what was so interesting about the first administration was that we shifted the dynamics. We brought Israel and the Arab states together because of their mutual concern about Iran and its hegemonic aggression, and what the ayatollahs intend- intended to do. We sat the Palestinian issue aside for a bit--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.",
      "REP. WALTZ: And that is what I think the framework we'll get back to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to. So I want to ask you what we should expect in terms of executive actions in these early days from Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Oh, well, look, we're going to have his campaign promises that he promised to the American people right out there on the table, in terms of border, in terms of energy, in terms of taking on this kind of DEI woke culture that has infected so many parts of our federal government, including our military. Returning us to a meritocracy. He's got a lot in front of them. I'm excited to be a part of it. I can't emphasize enough though, Margaret, on the border, the American people gave him a clear mandate. Lock down our border, deport the worst of the worst, take on the cartels. We cannot have a situation where we have paramilitary gangs that are shooting down aircraft with heavy weapons, controlling 30% of our neighbor, Mexico, and controlling whole swaths of our border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about perhaps an executive order designating cartels as a terrorist group? Or designating in some way--",
      "REP. WALTZ: -- I don't want to get ahead of the announcements, but we have to- we have to deal with them with what they are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --okay.",
      "REP. WALTZ: These are- these are paramilitary organizations with billions at their disposal, with armored vehicles, heavy machine guns, that are fighting the Mexican army. \u00a0Not police, army, to a standstill. President Trump was clear on the campaign trail that we're going to take them on and then we're going to use every resource that we need to defend the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are seeing in our polling that there is a lot of approval for the president elect's plan to deport immigrants who are here illegally. But understanding how that works is something I want to ask you. Can you tell us anything about the scope and scale of the roundups that we should expect in these first few days?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, I think they're going to be- they're going to be quite aggressive. Number one. Number two, they're going to go after these criminal gangs that are terrorizing our cities, particularly MS-13, and particularly Tren De Aragua, our communities are asking for it. Our neighbors are asking for it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- One of those Tren De Aragua-, excuse me- Tren De Aragua is Venezuelan. You can't deport to Venezuela. So where are you going to send those?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, we're in a number of conversations with a number of countries that will agree to take them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that's a big diplomatic initiative you're a part of.",
      "REP. WALTZ: That's right. That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you about China as well. Xi Jinping is sending a Special Representative to the inauguration. That's highly unusual, not just because of protocol, but because of protocol, but because of the moment in time we are in. Why launch a charm offensive with China at the same time we know that they are embedded in our infrastructure? As you have said, they've planted cyber time bombs.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Yeah, yeah. Xi is sending his Vice President. and President Trump does not believe you can get into the types of deals that he wants to get into, whether it is pushing the Chinese to take on fentanyl, to put a death penalty in place for the producers of fentanyl that know that they are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, whether it's on trade negotiations, restoring some sense of stability in the Western Pacific and particularly in the South China Sea, unless he has a relationship with the head of state where all the decisions are made--",

WALTZ: -- the sponsors, the sponsors that are hypocritically, kind of pounding the table about social justice here at home and at the time, this was 21-22 when that was a huge movement here in the United States. I mean, you had the, you know, you had a number of companies talking about Black Lives Matter, social justice here at home, but then we're turning a blind eye to the genocide that was going on over there--",

      "REP. WALTZ: -- But you can't engage in those conversations unless, particularly with a top down authoritarian system like the Chinese Communist Party, unless they have a relationship. And that's President Trump's style. He believes he can enter in these deals with that type of- with that type of regime, only by having a relationship. So that's what he seeks to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- I mean, having a conversation is different than being an honored guest. They are attacking the United States in a massive espionage attack--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- We can't even get them out of the telecom systems--",
      "REP. WALTZ: -- He is not making any concessions on anything. It is about establishing a relationship. Xi declined to come personally, so he's sending his vice president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : Tiktok took itself offline at midnight because of this national security law that you signed on to as- as a congressman which recognizes that TikTok, owned by a Chinese firm, Bytedance, is a national security threat. But on this notice, it says Donald Trump has promised to work with them. If Mr. Trump issues an executive order that bypasses a national security law. Isn't this a risk? How are you going to prevent China from doing what you say they're doing already, which is siphoning up and spying on Americans?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well look, I would- I would even point to the author of the law, former representative, Mike Gallagher, who has put out, you know, his goal was never to eliminate TikTok. It was to allow Americans to use it, but then to make it safe from Chinese communists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was to have an American owner.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, right. So what we need between now and Monday is to buy the president some time to evaluate those deals. And if it goes dark, that's going to be, obviously, extremely problematic. So both can be true. We can have an app that Americans can- Americans can enjoy, but at the same time that protects their data and protects them from outside influence and undue influence. And that's the time and space that the President is seeking. And as a deal maker, I think we all should be confident that he can craft that kind of a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have Tiktok and ByteDance told you that they're actually interested in selling?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, the President worked with- spoke with President Xi. Again, very top down authoritarian system that--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And must share information at the request of the Chinese Communist Party?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, that was the concern of a lot, right--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Exactly. And Tom Cotton is saying that. Just now- the Republican leader on the Intelligence Committee--",
      "REP. WALTZ: -- Sure, sure. And again, you know the- the author of the law is saying both can be true. We can have an app that protects Americans. And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the US government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe that an American owner will emerge and a deal will be done within 90 days?",
      "REP. WALTZ: I don't want your head of President Trump on the deal, but he is definitely wanting to have the time right now, which would mean an extension to evaluate the deals that are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, the head of- the Republican head of the Intelligence Committee says the law wouldn't allow for that, because you need to show that there is significant progress--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, you told us, as I said, China put cyber time bombs throughout U.S. infrastructure and the U.S. needs to go on offense, to impose higher consequences. Are you going to keep the Biden sanctions related to Salt Typhoon in place? Do they go far enough? Do you have an idea of where you want to go next? ,",
      "REP. WALTZ: Yeah, we're going to, I mean, we need to get our people in place. We need to get Hegseth in as secretary of defense. We need to get Rubio in as secretary of state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That could take- Rubio will be quick. Hegseth could take sometime.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Yeah, I think by the end of next week, Pete Hegseth is going to be just fine. So and we need to get John Ratcliffe in place, and we'll come together. My job is to pull the interagency together, tee up options for the President, help him make a decision and then execute. I can just tell you, from my own perspective, as a broader framework, we cannot play perfect defense. We are under a tsunami of cyber attacks, and we just keep trying to defend better. Let's take a hard look at unleashing our private sector and those capabilities. Let's take a hard look at trying to change behaviors in the first place, and that will mean a better, stronger, more capable offensive capability. So that any adversary, if they believe they can destroy our grid, destroy our water supply, destroy our pipelines, if they know we can do the same, then hopefully that prevents it from ever happening in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Trump's envoy to Ukraine has set a 100 day timeline for trying to get an end to this war in place. Is there a blueprint? Will Mr. Trump go to Kyiv? When will he meet with Vladimir Putin?",
      "REP. WALTZ: \u00a0I'm not going to get ahead of all of those things, but I'll tell you the key- the key pieces of it. Number one, who do we get to the table? Number two, how do we drive them to the table? And then three, what are the frameworks of a deal? President Trump is clear, this war has to stop. Everyone, I think, should be on board with that. And in fact, Zelenskyy even is walking into the room now saying, we're ready to work with you, President Trump, to stop this war. It is a killing field, Margaret. This is World War One trench warfare with literally a meat grinder of people running across these open fields in eastern Ukraine. But with World War Three escalation consequences. And it's expanding, with North Korea now sending in tens of thousands, South Korea very upset and talking about getting involved in some way. We- you know, this conflict needs to end, and President Trump has been very clear about that and is determined to do it.",

As the first junior officer, and I think this is really important, he wasn't in the headquarters when our policies drifted in the Middle East leading to decades of war. He was on the front lines. You know, the kind of dust on the boots, dirt under the fingernails type of junior officer that was saying, \"What the heck are we doing here? Where is this going? How does this end? What does victory look like?\" So I shared that experience with him, was proud to introduce him. And the point I made to the Senate was they have hearing after hearing- I do, too, in the House as a member of the Armed Services Committee, complaining about retention, readiness, industrial based problems, things that cost too much, take too long, deliver half as much as- as promised. And yet, some people are opposed to a disrupter, to a change agent. I'm glad he doesn't have a defense contractor background. I'm glad he wasn't a former general, because that hasn't worked. Enough is enough. It's time for change.",

He also didn't go to war with Iran. What's his position? Would he support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, which would require U.S. assistance and help and weaponry?",

Hamas decapitated in an amazing covert operation, the pager and walkie talkie operation. Everyone said taking out Hezbollah's leader Nasrallah would be too escalatory, too provocative, can't be done. You know what? They did it. And that has now led to a real moment of opportunity in Lebanon. It's led to the fall of Assad and his brutal dictatorship. It's led to Hamas being completely isolated. They always thought the cavalry was going to come from the north with Hezbollah. That's no longer the case, and I think a key reason they've now entered into a deal. And Iran's air defenses are destroyed. So this is a moment to make those key decisions, and we'll be doing that over the next month.",

      "Joe Biden's inauguration four years ago took place just two weeks after rioters stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification of his victory. When Biden's presidency began with his exhortation that \"democracy has prevailed,\" few imagined it would end like this: being succeeded by a man who, Biden warned, \"will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.\"",

      "Four years ago, most Americans were optimistic about a Biden presidency and evaluations of him started off on a positive note. His overall approval rating was in the 60s, lifted, in part, by optimism about getting the COVID pandemic under some control. But this was short-lived. After the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that summer, Mr.\u00a0Biden's approval rating declined\u00a0and dropped even further that fall amid public concerns about inflation. It never recovered.",

      "These low approval ratings extended to his management of specific issues. For most of his presidency, Mr. Biden received negative marks for his handling of key issues such as the economy and inflation \u2014 top concerns for Americans.",
      "As he embarked on his reelection campaign, voters repeatedly expressed doubts over whether Mr. Biden had the cognitive health to serve as president. Those doubts grew after a poor presidential debate performance. After that, most didn't think he should be running for president, including many in his own party.",
      "In July, President Biden stepped aside as the Democratic nominee, but that may have been too late for some. Today, more than half of Democrats think Kamala Harris would have won the presidential election if Mr. Biden had stepped aside sooner, but the public overall doesn't think the timing of his withdrawal from the race would have mattered.",

      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",

    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",

      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A fire in the aft section of SpaceX's Starship trigged the apparent explosion that destroyed the spacecraft, the company says.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",
      "Going into Thursday's test flight, SpaceX said 2025 \"will be transformational for Starship with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in 2027.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched by NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in lunar orbit and then descend to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",

      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "In a news release, SpaceX said that \"initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas.\"",
      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists.

      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Firefly's \"Blue Moon\" and ispace's \"Resilience\" are the latest in an ongoing push to gain private-sector experience exploring the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",
      "\"Knowing that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is a culmination of what the last Apollo astronaut to walk on the moon observed is a fitting tribute to their legacy,\" Kim said.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to issue an executive order on Monday to postpone the ban on TikTok from going into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok began restoring service to users in the United States following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to try to pause the ban by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",
      "STATEMENT FROM TIKTOK:In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170\u2026",
      "TikTok app owner ByteDance voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "The app was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the president-elect had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and \"they agreed to work together on this.\"",
      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to \"save\" TikTok, and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",

      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Top technology company CEOs, whose companies have collectively donated millions to Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee, are expected to have a conspicuous presence at the ceremony. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is\u00a0scheduled to attend, sources told CBS News this week; the online retailer was among the companies that donated $1 million to the fund.",
      "Other chief executives\u00a0set to attend Trump's inauguration include Google's Sundar Pichai; Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, whose company also contributed $1 million to the inauguration fund; and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, whose company could go dark in the U.S. as soon as Sunday after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law that could lead to a ban.",
      "Not surprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump has tapped along with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to explore ways to cut federal spending, will also appear at the inauguration, CBS News has confirmed. Musk said\u00a0on his social media platform, X, this week that he felt \"honored\" to sit alongside Bezos and \u00a0Zuckerberg on the inauguration dais, where Cabinet members, nominees and elected officials are placed.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "The cease-fire is in place. The prisoner swap is under way. Is this the beginning of the end of the devastating war in Gaza? Phase one of this fragile deal is unfolding just hours before America begins its own handover of presidential power.",
      "Change is coming to Washington. And despite the expected pomp and pageantry, the challenges facing our 47th president are numerous and sobering.",
      "We will talk about the immediate ones with the incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Tim Kaine will also join us.",
      "Is the cease-fire deal the beginning of a new way forward for peace in the Middle East? We will talk with a key Biden negotiator of the truce and explore the humanitarian crisis facing the youngest victims of the war in Gaza \u2013 just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning. As we come on the air, there is good news to report. We are awaiting official word that the first three hostages have safely crossed the border out of Gaza and are back home in Israel. But what you are seeing here now are the crowds awaiting their return.",
      "They are, and CBS can confirm, in the custody of the Red Cross.",
      "We begin today with our Elizabeth Palmer reporting from Jerusalem \u2013 Liz.",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: The day began with a tense delay, as Hamas failed to identify the hostages it was going to release and then Israel launched fresh attacks on Gaza.",
      "Then, suddenly, at 11:15 local time, the cease-fire fell into place.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER (voice-over): The first three hostages released by Hamas were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza to begin their journey home, Romi Gonen, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher, both seized from their kibbutz, Kfar Aza.",
      "That was 471 days ago, when, on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists abducted or killed more than 1,000 people in Southern Israel. Within hours, Israel's military was bombing Gaza. Fifteen months later, it's too soon to say the war has ended, but it is on pause.",
      "Hamas and some of its supporters were celebrating the cease-fire as a victory. As part of the deal, Israel is supposed to release almost 100 Palestinian prisoners from jail later today.",
      "Mohammad El-Halabi is expected to be one of them. His family in Gaza is waiting anxiously.",
      "(RIHAL SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: \"He was arrested when I was only 3 years old,\" says his daughter,\" Rihal (sp?), \"and I'm now 12.\"",
      "There are scars on both sides. Noa Argamani, a former hostage abducted at the Nova Festival, was rescued after eight terrifying months.",
      "NOA ARGAMANI (Former Hostage): I lived in a fear every single day. I didn't want the guarders to suddenly lose control and kill me. All the terrorists was armed with many weapons, knife and grenade. I lived in a war zone. Every second felt like the last second of my life.",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: So much could go wrong with this complex deal. For a start, it has to hold for months if all the hostages are to be freed. And it depends on two parties with internal rifts, Israel's government, whose right wing is fiercely opposed to the cease-fire, and Hamas, which has a weakened and divided leadership.",
      "GERSHON BASKIN (Israeli Hostage Negotiator): And there's no reason why they should trust each other.",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: Gershon Baskin is a former hostage negotiator.",
      "So there will be breaches?",
      "GERSHON BASKIN: Definitely.",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: Is there a mechanism to deal with the inevitable accusations and breaches and hiccups?",
      "GERSHON BASKIN: This time around, there is. It's called Donald Trump.",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER: Everyone who wants this deal to hold is pinning hopes on Washington's authority. That includes Gazans who are hungry and desperate for aid to arrive and the hostages' families, who want their loved ones back, alive or dead.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by Congressman Mike Waltz. He's the incoming national security adviser to president-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ (R-Florida) (Incoming U.S. National Security Adviser): Good to be with you. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand, just yesterday, you were meeting with the families of some of the hostages being held in Gaza, at least three Americans assessed to still be alive and in captivity.",
      "One of them might not be released until phase two, when male soldiers are released and Israeli troops withdraw. Will the Trump team see this through to completion?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, remember, the terms of the deal that we finally have come to was inherited in many ways from the Biden administration.",
      "So it was actually the Biden negotiators that were at the table, and the \u2013 the other side was dealing with them, but kind of looking to us, particularly Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "And one of the things that we inherited was this framework of women, the elderly and the sick coming out first. The \u2013 one of the Americans is an Israeli soldier. He \u2013 that means he'll come out in the second phase, but we will get him out, period.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Edan Alexander.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And I \u2013 Edan Alexander.",
      "And I am convinced, Margaret, that this deal would have never happened had President Trump not been elected, the Trump effect, so to speak. And the families believe that. They were effusive in their thanks for him and the - - the TRUTH that he put out that put Hamas on notice that there will be consequences if they don't let our people go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is also obviously the party Israel here\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that feels some pressure to get this done. One far right member of the Netanyahu government resigned. Another this morning said he will bring down the Netanyahu government if it does not return to fighting in a way that leads Israel to taking over the entire Gaza Strip.",
      "Does Mr. Trump support annexation of the West Bank and Gaza?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well \u2013 excuse me \u2013 very different things.",
      "What we're talking about here is making sure that Hamas is destroyed as a terrorist organization. Hamas is no different than ISIS or al Qaeda or any of the worst of the worst that has so brutalized the Middle East over the years.",
      "And what we have made clear to Bibi Netanyahu, to his government \u2013 and I want the Israeli people to hear me loud and clear \u2013 if Hamas reneges on this deal, if Hamas backs out, moves the goalposts, what have you, we will support Israel in doing what it has to do, number one, and, number two, Hamas will never govern Gaza.",
      "That is completely unacceptable, because they've made their intention clear, which is to destroy Israel and to have future October 7's. So I understand the concern. But, at the end of the day, Prime Minister Netanyahu supported this deal. He agreed we needed to get those hostages out.",
      "And within the next 24 hours, we will see \u2013 we will see three women coming out alive and hugging their families. And had we not entered this, these people would have died, Margaret. I mean, these conditions that they were in \u2013 by the way, they've been held now longer than the hostages in 1979 in the Iranian hostage crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: They were being brutalized, raped, tortured. It was horrific.",
      "But now we're going to have a Reagan moment. We are going to have President Trump being sworn in as hostages are coming out alive, and that's something we should all celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also said, though, that you want to build on this to eventually get peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, normalization.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The price of that is recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Does Mr. Trump support a two-state solution? Hamas doesn't want two states. The far right in Israel doesn't want two states.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump's plan in his first term, his plan for the Middle East and his plan for Israel and Palestine had a pathway to a two-state, with all kinds of very important qualifiers that had to be in place beforehand, stop radicalizing the next generation of Palestinian youth, very specifics \u2013 components of that plan in terms of how things would be divided up.",
      "But I do think we can get to the next round of the Abraham Accords. We \u2013 I do think we can expand it, and that will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which will be tremendous. That has been a main goal of the Netanyahu government now for years.",
      "And, Margaret, I can tell you, for President Trump, if \u2013 in a short amount of time, if we're talking about infrastructure projects, ports, rails, fiber, data center, if we're talking about all of those things, these historic animosities will become smaller and smaller and smaller, and that is the piece that he seeks and that only he can lead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Mr. Huckabee, the possible future ambassador to Israel, is wrong when he says that Mr. Trump does not believe in a two- state solution in the future?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I have spoken to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said that yesterday on FOX.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "No, I have spoken to him. And it's \u2013 it's, how do we eventually get there, right? And what we eventually want is the Abraham Accords and that next round, right? And there is a lot of room. Both can be true. We are going to protect Israel. We are going to make sure that they are defended.",
      "But, eventually, we're going to come to some accommodation that Saudi Arabia is comfortable in entering into that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To lead to a Palestinian state? That's what they're asking.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, we'll see exactly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A process.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 what that looks like. That process is going to \u2013 is going to be long.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And what \u2013 you know, what was so interesting about the first administration was that we shifted the dynamics.",
      "We brought Israel and the Arab states together because of their mutual concern about Iran and its hegemonic aggression, and what the ayatollahs intend \u2013 intended to do. We sat the Palestinian issue aside for a bit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And that is what \u2013 I think the framework we'll get back to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to.",
      "So I want to ask you what we should expect in terms of executive actions in these early days from Mr. Trump.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, well, look, we're going to have his campaign promises that he promised to the American people right out there on the table, in terms of border, in terms of energy, in terms of taking on this kind of DEI, woke culture that has infected so many parts of our federal government, including our military, returning us to a meritocracy.",
      "He's got a lot in front of him. I'm excited to be a part of it. I can't emphasize enough though, Margaret, on the border, the American people gave him a clear mandate, lock down our border, deport the worst of the worst, take on the cartels. We cannot have a situation where we have paramilitary gangs that are shooting down aircraft with heavy weapons, controlling 30 percent of our neighbor Mexico and controlling whole swathes of our border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about perhaps an executive order designating cartels as a terrorist group or designating in some way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: I don't want to get ahead of the announcements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: But we have to \u2013 we have to deal with them with what they are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: These are \u2013 these are paramilitary organizations with billions at their disposal, with armored vehicles, heavy machine guns that are fighting the Mexican army, not police, army, to a standstill.",
      "President Trump was clear on the campaign trail that we're going to take them on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And then we're going to use every resource that we need to defend the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are seeing in our polling that there is a lot of approval for the president-elect's plan to deport immigrants who are here illegally.",
      "But understanding how that works is something I want to ask you. Can you tell us anything about the scope and scale of the roundups that we should expect in these first few days?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think they're going to be \u2013 they're going to be quite aggressive, number one.",
      "Number two, they're going to go after these criminal gangs that are terrorizing our cities, particularly MS-13, and particularly Tren de Aragua. Our communities are asking for it. Our neighbors are asking for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where are you going to deport them to? Because one of those Tren de Ara \u2013 excuse me.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Aragua, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tren de Aragua is Venezuelan. You can't deport to Venezuela. So where are you going to send those people?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, we're in a number of conversations with a number of countries that will agree to take them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So that's a big diplomatic initiative you're a part of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes, that's right. That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: TikTok took itself offline at midnight because of this national security law that you signed on to as \u2013 as a congressman which recognizes that TikTok, owned by a Chinese firm, ByteDance, is a national security threat.",
      "But, on this notice, it says Donald Trump has promised to work with them. If Mr. Trump issues an executive order that bypasses a national security law, isn't this a risk? I mean, how are you going to prevent China from doing what you say they're doing already\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which is siphoning up and spying on Americans?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, I would \u2013 I would even point to the author of the law, former Representative Mike Gallagher, who has put out, you know, his goal was never to eliminate TikTok. It was to allow Americans to use it, but then to make it safe from Chinese Communist Party interference.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was to have an American owner of it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, right.",
      "So what we need between now and Monday is to buy the president some time to evaluate those deals. And, if it goes dark, that's going to be, obviously, extremely problematic. So both can be true. We can have an app that Americans can \u2013 Americans can enjoy, but at the same time that protects their data and protects them from outside influence and undue influence.",
      "And that's the time and space that the president is seeking. And as a dealmaker, I think we all should be confident that he can craft that kind of a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have TikTok and ByteDance told you that they're actually interested in selling?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, the president worked with \u2013 spoke with President Xi, again, very top-down, authoritarian system that he is in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think he is the ultimate decider?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And they \u2013 and they \u2013 and they agreed to work together on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Xi is acknowledging that he has control of ByteDance and TikTok?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Not explicitly, but I will tell you, every company in China has \u2013 in some way or some form has to report to or has a member of the Chinese Communist Party on its board.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And must share information, at the request of the Chinese Communist Party?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, that was the concern of a lot, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Tom \u2013 Tom Cotton is saying that just now, the Republican running the Intelligence Committee.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Sure. Sure.",
      "And, again, you know the \u2013 the author of the law is saying both can be true. We can have an app that protects Americans. And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you believe that an American owner will emerge and a deal will be done within 90 days?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: I don't want to get ahead of President Trump on the deal, but he is definitely wanting to have the time right now, which would mean an extension, to evaluate the deals that are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. The head of \u2013 the Republican head of the Intelligence Committee says the law wouldn't allow for that, because you need to show that there was significant progress.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: No, actually, the law says, if there's a viable deal on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, exactly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Right? I know of at least\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying there is a viable deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And I know of at least one from Kevin O'Leary that's been delivered to ByteDance, that the \u2013 the point is, what is a viable deal?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: The president needs the time with the Department of Justice to evaluate what viable means. And we can't do that if the thing is completely dark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'll be on the job starting at noon Monday?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Honor of my life. Thanks so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Waltz, thank you.",
      "We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn to Brett McGurk, White House National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "Good to have you here, Brett.",
      "BRETT MCGURK (White House National Security Council Coordinator For the Middle East and North Africa): Thanks, Margaret. Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're watching the breaking news. This is a deal you negotiated. What can you tell us about how these three women who have been transferred to the Red Cross are doing?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Well, I just confirmed with my Israeli counterparts that they're now in Israeli custody. So this has just happened.",
      "Look, I know they're alive. I'm sure they are in \u2013 that they've been held in deplorable conditions over 470 days, but the Israelis have a very good system to take them into their care, and they're going to get the care they need and be reunited with their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It appeared that, even up until this morning, it was in question whether Hamas was going to go through with this. The Israelis said they hadn't handed over the names of the captives.",
      "Do we \u2013 why? And do we know much about the well-being of the three Americans that are still being held?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Well, look, this deal was negotiated over a year, for good reason.",
      "It's a detailed, complex arrangement to leave nothing to chance. And even up to last night, I was up until 4:00 in the morning, when this finally went into place, to make sure that everything went according to the plan. Hamas owed the list of the three names. That had to happen for the cease- fire to go into effect.",
      "That was delayed a couple hours. It eventually happened, and now we have the news today. You have a full cease-fire in effect in Gaza. You have about 800 trucks of aid getting into Gaza today. And you have had\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eight hundred?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Eight hundred trucks of aid should reach Gaza today. And you've had the three girls now, again, reunited, hopefully with their families, and they're now in Israeli custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.N. says an average of 72 trucks per day went in, in December, and that's been the case in January. Is there even the capacity for the Israelis to search these trucks and allow in that food? Do you expect 800 trucks to make it into Gaza today?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: That's why \u2013 that's why I have been in the Middle East for the last month nonstop to make sure everything is ready to go. This was not put together in the last week. This has been put together really since May, when President Biden laid out this framework.",
      "He developed this framework with the emir of Qatar and with the president of Egypt, President Sisi. He announced it to the world in May. It was unanimously endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. We thought we were close in August, Margaret, and then we had six hostages killed in a tunnel underneath Rafah.",
      "I was just in your green room talking to the mother \u2013 or speaking with the mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed tragically in August. It was that incident in August, when Hamas killed those hostages, that we decided to flip the script. There was not a deal because Hamas would not agree to release hostages.",
      "We supported the Israelis in going after Hezbollah. They took out Hezbollah. That\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In Lebanon.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: In Lebanon.",
      "We have a cease-fire in Lebanon. We have a new government in Lebanon. That isolated Hamas. Iran is in the weakest position it's been in the Middle East in decades. So, when we went back to the table in December, Hamas, for the first time, for the first time, was ready to accept the May framework and begin to release hostages.",
      "It wasn't until early January that they actually approved the hostage list, and that's how we got to the result today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do we know, Keith Siegel, Sagui Chen, and Edan Alexander, how they're doing?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Keith will come out in phase one. Sagui will come out in phase one. Edan was a uniformed Israeli soldier. He is phase two. But we are committed.",
      "And I think you just heard this from Mike Waltz, and we've been working seamlessly with the incoming team. I think this is a testament to President Biden and to President Trump, allowing us to work together. I worked with Steve Witkoff over the last week, again, a partnership, I think historic, to help get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump's envoy.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "BRETT MCGURK: And we are committed \u2013 We are committed to getting Edan out as early as possible. I spoke with Adi Alexander, Edan's father, just last night.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu described this overnight as a temporary cease-fire. And he says he has permission to begin fighting as needed.",
      "Do you believe he sees this as just a strategic pause, or that he actually wants to end this war?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: The way the deal is structured, on day 16, the negotiations begin for phase two. Phase two will begin a negotiation for the exchange of soldiers to Palestinian prisoners.",
      "But, also, the conditions have to be set for phase two, and we support the Israelis in making sure those conditions are set, so Hamas can never come back to power in Gaza, Hamas can never again threaten Israel from Gaza.",
      "Those conditions have to be set. We in the Biden administration have been very clear. We want to see this \u2013 this deal reached, all three phases, every hostage come home. I think the Trump administration very much shares that objective. And the template, the road map, again, that the president set out in May, this was the road map ultimately to ending the war, getting everybody home, is the only way to do it.",
      "That road map is now in place. We have a cease-fire today in Gaza, and we have a good chance to get every hostage home, and we have got to do everything we can to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Hamas, according to Secretary Blinken, has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost over the course of this war. Blinken said that this week.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: Hamas has been significantly decimated. Its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed in October. Without that, we would not be at this deal.",
      "Hamas on October 7 was an organized military formation. It invaded Israel with 3,500 troops in military formations, combat brigades. It is now no longer able to do that. It does not have military capacity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that argues that Israel has done something that may backfire on them, in terms of the humanitarian situation that has allowed Hamas not to lose support, but to continue to recruit.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: To get the \u2013 I \u2013 I worked closely with my Israeli colleagues. I spent hours with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is a deal that he fully supports. They agree. There's a moral debt to these hostages. You have to get them out.",
      "And Israel is also going to make sure that it protects its national security. And we're going to make sure we do that. You know, Margaret, we got this deal without that wider Middle East war that everybody was predicting. Americans did not get drawn into a wider Middle East war.",
      "We defended Israel from Iranian missiles. We supported Israel going after Hezbollah. We supported Israel going after Hamas. We have defanged Iran's proxy networks around the region, and that led to the isolation of Hamas to actually get this deal today. That's how we got to this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "I have to take a break here, Brett, so don't mean to cut you off. But we will have more questions, but we have to take a quick break.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this just came in. President-elect Trump has just announced he plans to issue an executive order tomorrow to postpone the ban on TikTok.",
      "So, all you TikTok users could see it back online possibly very soon.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Brett McGurk of the National Security Council under President Biden.",
      "Brett, I just want to pick up where we left off.",
      "Just this past week President Biden gave one of his last interviews and he shared a private conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "Take a listen to it.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): And I said, but, Bibi, I said, you can't be carpet bombing these communities. And he said to me, well, you did it. You carpet bombed - not his exact words, but you carpet bombed Berlin. You dropped a nuclear weapon. You killed thousands of innocent people, because you had to in order to win a war.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, President Biden went on to say, that's why the entire U.N. and international order was created, to stop that from ever happening again.",
      "How much do you think Israel's standing in the world has been damaged by the conduct of its military?",
      "BRETT MCGURK: (White House National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa): Well, Margaret, that was a conversation early on when the debate was whether or not the Israelis should go in on the ground. And we had a debate with them about that. Ultimately, we supported them, and they were right because Hamas was living in 400 miles of tunnels underneath Gaza. There was no way to root out Hamas without going into Gaza. And, frankly, you can see -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he was talking about dropping bombs on buildings.",
      "BRETT MCGURK: But you can see Hamas - but I'm just going back to what the conversation was about. It was about how this was going to go. And look, we have worked very closely with the Israelis. Too many people have died in this war. That's why we're - we worked so hard to get to where we are today with a ceasefire. The ceasefire today, this framework, the roadmap the president laid out in May, was the only way to end the war. And the only way to end the war was, frankly, with massive pressure on Hamas and knocking out the other proxies that were supporting Hamas.",
      "I just have to emphasize this again, when Hezbollah was firing on Israel every single day, it was Hassan Nasrallah's position that they would not stop shooting on Israel and making northern Israel a no man's land until - until Israel accepted all of Hamas' terms in Gaza. Israel had to knock out Hezbollah to get this deal. That's what happened with a ceasefire at the end of November. That's what opened up the space to get this deal.",
      "It's been a brutal war, but to end it we get we had to get the ceasefire deal. And to do that, to do that, we had to support Israel and back them up, and we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if this ceasefire becomes an end to the war, and there's more diplomacy ahead.",
      "Brett McGurk, thank you for sharing the details.",
      "We're going to turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Seneca, South Carolina.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you are supportive of this ceasefire and Mike Waltz's pledge to see it through?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I very much appreciate what Brett and Steve Witkoff have done. Let me just say this, these people would not be coming out if Donald Trump had not demanded they'd be out. Everything Brett said about pressure on Hamas and Iran is true, but the game changer, when Trump said, I want them out or all hell will be to pay.",
      "Now, here's what I'm hoping, they come out, the deal holds, but what does the end of the war look like?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I want to reinforce something to you. This war will never end with Hamas in charge of Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Politically or militarily. Their days are numbered. And the next question for the world is, what do we do about the Iran nuclear program? That's where we're going to move to next.",
      "There's diplomacy, there's a one in a trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: There's a 90 percent chance you'll degrade it through military action by Israel, supported by the United States. So, the next topic I will be engaging in with President Trump is to take this moment in time to decimate the Iran nuclear program because they're so exposed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Help Israel deliver a knockout blow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It means giving Israel the capability -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? You're going to urge him to have Israel bomb Iran's facilities that are underground and would require U.S. military support to actually have - be effective?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm going to - I'm going to urge the decimation of the Iranian nuclear program. I don't think diplomacy works. Brett will tell you what they have done to Hezbollah and Hamas has been amazing. The proxies are incredibly weakened. Israel can go anywhere they want to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: This is a religious Nazi regime. They want to destroy the Jewish state. They want to purify Islam and drive us out of the Mideast.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well - well -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It would be like negotiating with Hitler.",
      "I am hoping there will be an effort by Israel to decimate the Iran nuclear program, supported by the United States. And if we don't do that, it will be a historical mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey Graham, I have a lot to get to on the domestic front, but that is quite a marker to lay down.",
      "I want to ask you about what you are working on domestically with Steven Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, on border security.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it's part of the massive Republican reconciliation bill that's being put together.",
      "Do you have a top line number yet on how much this is all going to cost?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, $100 billion for border security through reconciliation would be enough to hire ICE agents, create new detention beds, and finish the wall and put technology in place over four years. $200 billion will be given to the military to make it more capable of deterring China. $100 billion for border. $200 billion for the military.",
      "I met with Mike Johnson yesterday. He is a dear friend. I admire him greatly. He has a political problem in the House. He wants to - to do one big, beautiful bill. I have never been more worried about an attack on our homeland than I am now with the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan and wars all over the world. I think the number one priority for the Republican Party should be to secure that border. You need new money to do it. And if we don't, we're playing Russian roulette with our own national security.",
      "Border first, military funding first. Get the tax cuts and spending reductions put together later on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You need to secure that border like our life depended on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this bill is going to be bigger than the $300 billion you just laid out.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It's going to be a lot bigger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the timetable on that, because Johnson says Memorial Day.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I hope we can get there, but to those who want to reduce spending, I'm giving you an opportunity to come meet me next week. You've got to cut spending that's (ph) reconciliation compliant, and we've got enough votes to reduce spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, can we do $2.5 trillion over ten years? Let's give it a try.",
      "I want to do two things, cut spending and make the tax cuts permanent. The secretary of Treasury, Steve Bessent, said, if the tax cut expires, it will be a catastrophe for our economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't believe there's one Republican out there, if they were pushed, would let the tax cuts expire, because that's a $4.5 trillion tax increase. I want to cut spending, but my number one priority is to secure that border quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it - we will watch the politics of the possible with the very complicated caucus in the House.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the Senate, though, because you are on the Judiciary Committee. Kash Patel, the pick to run the FBI, doesn't even have a hearing scheduled yet. In his 2022 memoire, Bill Barr said of Kash Patel, \"he's someone with no background as an agent, would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau. He has virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency. The idea of moving him into a role like this showed a shocking detachment from reality.\"",
      "Was Attorney General Barr wrong then and wrong now?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I disagree with that. Yes, he was wrong then and he's wrong now. And I take my advice on Kash Patel from Trey Gowdy, dear friend from South Carolina, who worked with Kash. Kash was a public defender. He was a prosecutor. He worked with Trey Gowdy about the Russia hoax. So, I do think he has the experience. He has the trust of the president. And we'll see how this plays out. But Trey Gowdy is enthusiastically supporting Kash Patel, and that means a lot to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well - well, OK. But he's got a list he's published, Kash Patel has. He published it in a book of - of enemies. It includes people like the FBI director, Defense Secretary Austin, Bill Barr, former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, former CIA Director Gina Haskell, the head of CENTCOM.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, we're going to - well - yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, do you take him at his word here that - that these are an enemies list and you're going to put him in a law enforcement role to go after him?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I - I believe the hearing will expose him to be a very qualified man of the law. He wrote a book. He'll have to answer questions about what's in the book. But I'm ready to vote for him because I know him, too. See, he never asked me about the Russia hoax that he exposed. People on the right believe that he was part of the solution, not the problem.",
      "You asked a good question of Brett, has Israel suffered because of this war, they went too far, on the world stage? Here's what's happened on the world stage. The International Criminal Court is going to be sanctioned by the Congress -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's a -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Republicans and Democrats, because they're trying to prosecute the prime minister, defense minister of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey, this a - Lindsey Graham, this is a far cry from the question about Kash Patel. You took me all the way to Israel from Kash Patel.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, well, let's get back to Kash Patel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you - you're committing to vote for him no matter what?",
      "GRAHAM: Yes, we're not - I won't say no matter what, but I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are going to vote for Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I am ready to vote for Kash Patel because you will never ask me -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The role he played in exposing -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The darkest moment of the FBI -",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Since Edgar - J. Edgar Hoover. That's why I trust him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Ask him about going after journalists, which he's also said. I'm interested in the answer to that question.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Margaret, great to be with you. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the positions you hold on key committees that have a role in nominate - or in going through the confirmation process for some of Mr. Trump's picks.",
      "Senator Rubio is expected to be swiftly confirmed as secretary of state. You expect him in on day one?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do. He visited my office before the hearing. He did very well at the hearing. And I think we are likely to act on day one and he'll get a strong, bipartisan vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to some of the other picks, Democrats have very little say, frankly, because Republicans have this 53-seat majority, so they don't need Democratic votes. You sharply questioned Pete Hegseth this past week, who is the pick to run the Pentagon. You asked about his willingness to break oaths, having cheated on his second wife and the mother of a child born two months before when he had told police he was having consensual sex with a woman in Monterey, California, who filed a claim of sexual assault and he filed a financial settlement.",
      "Why did you choose to put that issue of character so front and center instead of asking him about policies?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: The - I - I believe he would be a very dangerous secretary of defense. And so my observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit. That's why Matt Gaetz withdrew, because the Senate Republicans felt, on both of those counts, he was a non-starter.",
      "I believe my questions of Pete Hegseth about his serial infidelity, about the allegation of sexual assault that he refused to disclose to President- elect Trump and the transition team and his own mother's allegation that he's a serial abuser of women. I think those are the kinds of things that might affect how Republicans view this. If not in the committee, possibly on the floor.",
      "We'll see. I think there's likely to be committee action as early as late tomorrow in the Armed Services Committee. We'll see when there's action on the floor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To actually confirm him.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, which is not liberal by any anyone's definition, said, \"Hegseth made noises about restoring U.S. military deterrents, that's something, but appears we're on track to have a secretary of defense whose real views are a mystery.\"",
      "Wasn't it also important to hear what his plans are for China and the like, because it looks like he is going to sail through if Republican leadership can keep Republicans in line and get them all to deliver the votes they need?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I - and, Margaret, I think they - if you look at the entire hearing, a number of his views were put on the table. I had seven minutes. It was so unusual to have a secretary of defense nominee refuse to even meet with any of the Democratic members of the committee, except for the chairman.",
      "RFK has met with Democratic members. The secretary of labor nominee, secretary of army, secretary of navy, secretary of state, they're all meeting with the Democratic members of the committee. But when he refused to meet with us, and you only have seven minutes, we divided up topics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I asked him about what I consider to be glaring faults of character. Other members of the committee asked him about positions on strategy, the role of women in combat, whether he is qualified to run an organization of the size of the Pentagon. I think overall in the hearing we put a lot of material on the table for folks to consider.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about immigration. You're a former governor. Incoming border czar Tom Homan has said that there will be massive deportation raids beginning as soon as Mr. Trump takes office. There are just about 300,000 undocumented individuals believed to be living in your state according to Pew Research. And I know your current governor, Youngkin, has pledged to fully support efforts through state law enforcement or the National Guard.",
      "How do you think this is going to work?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I don't exactly know how the administration is going to do it, but let me tell you, I'm hearing significant concerns from many sectors in the Virginia economy, agriculture, hospitality, health care, construction, that massive deportation raids would be an absolute gut punch to the Virginia and American economy. And if you add to that the Trump threat of massive tariffs, I think you're going to see a lot of pain for consumers and a lot of pain for employers if they carry through on mass deportation.",
      "Now, look, you've got a president who says a lot of things and then chooses not to do them. So, I don't know exactly what this is going to look like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: But I would say that the economy of Virginia and the economy of this country is going to suffer through deportation - mass deportations and tariffs if they go forward with what the president has said he will do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration prioritizes criminals in their roundups and deportations. The Trump administration says they're also going to target criminals. Do you think this is going to look different?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, it's - I do think the Biden administration prioritizes criminals who are a public safety risk, who pose a threat of violence. The Trump administration could go much broader than that. You know, looking at folks - I mean, for example, there's a bill that's pending on the - in the Senate right now that would deport people on the basis of an arrest, even if they've not been convicted of anything. A shoplifting arrest. Even if they've not been convicted of anything. A fundamental aspect of our society is that an arrest doesn't mean anything unless there's a conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Because people get arrested all the times for things that they didn't do. So, if the Trump administration says, look, an arrest leads to deportation even without a conviction, yes, it's going to look completely different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Completely different than what the policy has been during the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Tim Kaine, thank you for your time today.",

      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Not as of ten minutes ago, Margaret. We have 60 trucks waiting in that queue, all loaded up with warm clothing, shoes for kids, pallets with medicines, malnutrition treatment, which is sorely needed. We haven't as yet seen any go in. But that could have happen over the last couple of minutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's incredibly difficult just to get in through the security screenings. I think the peak has been 200 or so trucks per day. So, to scale up to 800 is pretty incredible, if they can pull that off.",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: It's massive. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I look at some of these statistics, they are just - just jaw-dropping, 1.1 million kids in Gaza -",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Half the population, need food. They're in urgent need. Surviving on one meal a day after 15 months of war.",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What state are these kids in?",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Oh, we - there's estimates that there's about 300,000 children in real acute need of malnutrition treatment. This is not just food, right, this is a medical treatment to make sure that they don't get real long-term consequences of their malnutrition, cognitive as well as physical. There are 150,000 pregnant and lactating women inside of Gaza who urgently need micro-nutrients as well to avoid those same consequences. So, the needs are enormous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I read, and this was particularly heartbreaking, that Save the Children is also going to try to connect more than 17,000 separated children to find family members.",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That's right. It's going to be a huge effort. You know, it's a real moment of hope and peril at the same time. We know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that?",
      "JANTI SOERIPTO: Well, what we'll do is to - we do family tracing. So, we're going to try to find extended family, even - even if no direct parents, extended families, aunts, uncles, nephews, neighbors sometimes, the community where they were, find members from that community, vet them, check backgrounds, and then the painstaking process of reuniting these children who - many of whom have been either displaced or lost or - and some even displaced outside of Gaza, help them reconnect to that community. A lot of mental health, psychosocial support, cash to make sure that that family's also able to - to care for them, in already a situation of where they've - most of them will have lost everything.",

We have 250 - a workforce of 250 Palestinians in Gaza who have been at it for 15 months. They are exhausted. They - they also need to get back to their - whatever is left of their homes. We urgently need to be able to surge in adequate capacity and specialism.",

      "JANTI SOERIPTO: That is going to be problematic. The operational infrastructure from UNRWA is - is massive. We've said that now for 15 months. All of us are humanitarian agencies cannot replace UNRWA just like that. If ever. Thirteen thousand UNRWA staff inside of Gaza where -",

Garvey was a Black nationalist who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s, and his sentence was commuted in 1927 by President Calvin Coolidge.

But his selection may be considered among the most contentious.",
      "Patel, 44, served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. The staunch Trump loyalist rose to prominence for his role in fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and later as key ally of Trump's as he tried to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "Former Attorney General William Barr, who worked under the Trump administration, wrote about the possible nomination of Patel for the FBI post in his memoir, saying Patel \"has virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency\" and that the \"idea of moving Patel into a rule like this showed a shocking detachment from reality.\"",
      "Graham said he disagreed with Barr's sentiment, saying he was \"wrong then and he's wrong now.\"",

      "Graham said he takes his advice on Patel from former Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who worked with Patel.",
      "\"Trey Gowdy is enthusiastically supporting Kash Patel, and that means a lot to me,\" Graham said.",
      "Patel, who has been critical of current federal officials, has sparked controversy for including in his book a list known as the \"Executive Branch Deep State,\" which some have referred to as an enemies list that he could seek to prosecute as FBI director. Barr is on the list, as are Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Biden, among many others.",
      "Graham said Patel will have to answer questions during his confirmation hearing about what's in the book, but he said that \"I believe the hearing will expose him to be a very qualified man of the law.\"",
      "FBI director Christopher Wray announced last month that he will resign at the end of the Biden administration, though his term was set to end in 2027. Even prior to Wray's announcement, Trump had announced his intention to install Patel at the helm of the FBI.",
      "Although Graham wouldn't commit to backing Patel \"no matter what,\" he said he is ready to vote for him \"because you will never ask me the role he played in exposing the darkest moment of the FBI since J. Edgar Hoover.\"",
      "In response, Brennan said Graham should ask Patel about \"going after journalists, which he's also said.\" Graham answered \"I'm sure our Democratic friends will ask him.\"",

    "summary": "Experts discuss the increased intensity we can expect from destructive weather events due to climate change, while an amateur meteorologist explains how he helped sound the alarm as wildfires spread towards the L.A. County community of Altadena.",
    "story": [
      "The monster that roared through L.A. County last week is still alive \u2013 but firefighters seem to have it cornered. People have started returning to their homes, or what's left of them. Insurance, if they had it, is a whole other battle.",
      "The focus now is turning from what happened to why it happened, and what in the world is next? \u00a0 This disaster is as bad as just about anybody here can remember \u2026 but is it really just the new normal?",
      "John Vaillant, author of \"Fire Weather: On the Front Lines of a Burning World,\" said, \"Nature is telling us, 'I can't take this anymore. I cannot support you if you keep treating me this way.'\"",
      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",
      "And so, he says, we get more intense fires \u2026 stronger hurricanes \u2026 and hotter heatwaves.",

      "\"So, for a few years I wanted to move to some place a little bit less fiery,\" he told us this week. \"But I want to make it clear, I don't think there's any place safe from climate change.\"",
      "Kalmus learned that firsthand last year, when North Carolina was trashed by Hurricane Helene. And the California fires were a disaster for him as well; his old house in Altadena, and his friends' homes, all burned to the ground. He said, \"I am hopeful that, if there's a silver lining to this tragedy, it's that, you know, the public will wake up and get angry and say, 'We need to do something about this. Enough is enough.'\"",

      "Climate chaos: Extreme heat, wildfires and record-setting storms suggest a frightening future is already here",
      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",
      "Jenn Siebert, an Altadena mother of two, didn't need to hear that twice. \"I think he, well, he definitely saved my family's lives,\" she said. \"We all listened to him. We were like, 'This kid knows what he's talking about!'\"",
      "Her own house somehow survived; her neighbors weren't so lucky. \"My best friends, like, they've lost everything,\" Siebert said. \"They're alive, because, probably because of Edgar, I would imagine. Everybody in the Beautiful Altadena group is alive because of Edgar, right now.\"",
      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",
      "I asked Vaillant, \"Have we just pushed Nature too far?\"",
      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "summary": "Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley looks at the considerable, often heroic achievements of Joe Biden, and at the mistakes that may color historians' view of his presidency, as the man Biden warned is a threat to democracy re-enters the White House.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of President Joe Biden's departure from the White House, we've asked historian Douglas Brinkley for his assessment of our 46th president:",
      "When President Richard Nixon died in 1994, most Americans thought instantly of one word: Watergate. They didn't think of the EPA, the vital government agency Nixon created. Nor did they think of China, the country he visited as president and strengthened diplomatic ties with. No, the country remembered him, above all, for his foulest political blunder.",
      "Whether the same fate will befall Joe Biden remains to be seen.",
      "His achievements are tangible and numerous. Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act has nearly doubled from four years ago. Biden got more federal judges confirmed than any president in a single term (save Jimmy Carter). His steadfast support for Ukraine and NATO expansion, at a time of creeping autocracy in Europe, was heroic.",
      "But Biden's mistakes cost him, and his country, dearly. He appointed an attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose painstaking scrupulousness delayed, and ultimately doomed, the DOJ's prosecution of Donald Trump. Furthermore, Biden undermined his own credibility by pardoning his son after repeatedly vowing not to.",
      "Another broken promise proved far more consequential. Biden's implicit campaign pledge in 2020 that his presidency would serve as a \"bridge\" to a new generation of leaders rang hollow when he ran for re-election four years later. When he reluctantly handed the reins to his vice president, Kamala Harris, he put her in an inauspicious position from which she didn't recover.",
      "Biden's mistaken conviction that he, and he alone, could defeat the man he considered a threat to the democratic order is the very reason that man will place his hand on the Bible tomorrow.",
      "Over his 50 years of public service, Joe Biden has proved himself a patriot. But for all his basic decency, history may come to remember him for another trait: hubris.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:46:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Socialite Perle Mesta used her fortune to host inclusive dinner parties in Washington, D.C., becoming one of the most famous women in the world \u2013 \"The Hostess with the Mostes' on the Ball.\"",
    "story": [
      "In \"Call Me Madam,\" the 1953 movie version of Irving Berlin's hit musical, it was no secret that Ethel Merman was channeling a real person \u2013 a wealthy widow by the name of Perle Mesta, who, in the 1940s and '50s, was one of the best-known women in America.",
      "\"I was astonished,\" said biographer Meryl Gordon. \"There were four or five thousand newspaper stories about her a year.\"",
      "Astonishing, says Gordon, because Mesta was known mainly as a hostess who gave dazzling parties in the nation's capital, mixing power brokers from both sides of the political aisle, with Hollywood and Broadway stars, and even members of the Supreme Court.",
      "As Merman sang:",
      "I'm the chosen party giver for the White House clienteleAnd they know that I deliver what it takes to make 'em jellAnd in Washington I'm known by one and allAs the hostess with the mostes' on the ball",
      "Gordon says, in the 1940s and '50s, Perle Mesta was \"the woman who knew everyone\" (the title of her new book). She said Mesta bought her way into society in Washington: \"But she was also smart about it. Perle figured out how to make friends with the right people. 'I'm having a couple senators over, maybe you'd like to join us?'",
      "\"She made herself very popular.\"",
      "She was born Pearl Skirvan. Her father, an oil man and real estate developer, made and lost several fortunes in Oklahoma. Perle moved to Pittsburgh after marrying George Mesta, a steel magnate, and when he died in 1925, he left Perle (then in her mid-thirties) a fortune that today would be worth more than $260 million.",
      "She spent that fortune to Washington, D.C., making herself famous, says Marie Ridder, a conservationist and retired journalist. \"She was known as the social queen of Washington.\"",
      "Ridder was 20 years old when she attended her first Perle Mesta party. \"She invited me to a party because she wanted press coverage,\" Ridder said. \"No other reason, not 'cause she thought I was charming or anything. No, it was the press badge she cared about.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did she want reporters there?\"",
      "\"She wanted to be known. Come on!\" laughed Ridder.",
      "Sally Quinn, who covered events like Mesta's as a style section reporter for the Washington Post, called her a phenomenon. \"I've never met anybody like Perle Mesta, and I've never heard of anybody like her,\" she said.",
      "Quinn says Mesta instinctively knew that work in Washington wasn't just conducted in the halls of Congress: \"You sit next to somebody at dinner, you know that, if you've been trying to get them on the phone \u2013 if they're at the White House, or the journalist trying to get them on the phone \u2013 [and] you can't, the next day, you'll be able to call and get them on the phone.\"",
      "By the late '40s, Mesta had become as famous as many of her guests. She inspired a \"Playhouse 90\" production, \"The Hostess with the Mostes',\" with Shirley Booth in the lead role. Mesta was even featured on the cover of Time Magazine.",
      "The coverage, however, wasn't always kind, describing her in ways (such as her \"more than ample bulk\") that would never be used for a male. \"It was surprisingly cruel, and I'm not really sure why,\" said Gordon. \"It was almost like people were trying to take her down a notch.\"",
      "But what made Mesta such a power in Washington was her uncanny ability to recognize political talent before others did: Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson were all early guests at her home. \"She had a real nose for who was going to be powerful,\" said Quinn. \"She was all over them long before they were who they were.\"",
      "In 1949, after Harry Truman was elected president, he rewarded Mesta by naming her envoy to Luxembourg. That's how \"Madame Mesta\" inspired the hit musical. But the appointment didn't go down as well at the State Department. \"She was belittled; she was cut out of meetings,\" said Gordon.",
      "Mesta described the difficulties she faced on an interview program that aired on CBS at the time. Asked \"Have you found being a woman a handicap in performing your ministerial duties?,\" Mesta replied, \"To a certain extent it's a handicap, because we have to prove ourselves. And we have to prove that we can do a job. I think maybe we have to work just a little bit harder than the men do.\"",
      "Still, Mesta thrived in the post, continuing to give parties, including a monthly event for American GIs based in Europe. \"This went on for four years,\" said Gordon. \"She estimated that 25,000 people, soldiers came to her parties.\"",
      "Gordon says that, only when researching her new biography, did she realize what the hostess managed to accomplish behind the scenes. Perle Mesta, a staunch feminist and believer in civil rights, broke barriers in 1949 by insisting that Truman's inaugural balls be integrated. \"She made an enormous effort to be inclusive at her parties, at parties she organized for Democrats, at a period which many people weren't comfortable having Black folks to their homes,\" Gordon said. \"And she did that. And it was leading by example. She wasn't a civil rights crusader. It's just that these were her friends, and she wanted them to be part of her life.\"",
      "Mesta's star began to fade during the Kennedy years. Ridder said, \"I guess many people took her seriously. I think my age group didn't.\"",
      "She died in 1975 at 92 years old. No one since, says Quinn, has taken her place. \"I don't think Washington could handle a Perle Mesta today,\" she said.",
      "Quinn doubts that, in the current environment, anyone could pull off what Mesta once did so brilliantly: getting Democrats and Republicans to sit down at a dinner table and see eye-to-eye. Are we missing out on something, not having that? \"Oh, terribly,\" said Quinn. \"It's just awful. It's awful that people can't get together and talk.\"",

      "The family of the doctor broke into tears, saying they were \"shocked\" at the sentence and had hoped her murderer would be hanged. But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not \"the rarest of the rare cases,\" and ordered that Roy must spend his life behind bars.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital's seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
      "Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime.",
      "The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim.",
      "Indian doctors in government hospitals across several states also staged a strike to protest the rape and murder.",

Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "The nationwide outrage and protests were similar to those seen after the\u00a02012 gang-rape and murder\u00a0of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus. That vicious attack prompted India to enact tougher laws against sexual violence, but according to the latest available government data, as recently as 2022 authorities were still registering about 90 rapes on average per day.",

    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

      "According to a list provided by the Palestinian Authority's Commission for Prisoners' Affairs, all of those released are women or teens, the youngest 15.

      "\"I know they're alive,\" McGurk said. \"They've been held in deplorable conditions over 470 days, but the Israelis have a very good system to take them into their care, and they're going to get the care they need and be reunited with their families.\"",
      "The ceasefire officially began earlier Sunday after a last-minute delay of almost three hours. The fighting continued past the initially provisioned 8:30 a.m. local (1:30 a.m. Eastern) deadline as the Israeli military said Hamas had failed to provide the names of the first three hostages due to be released, per the terms of the agreement.",

      "\"It's a detailed, complex arrangement to leave nothing to chance,\" McGurk said. \"And even up to last night, I was up until 4 o'clock in the morning, when this finally went into place to make sure that everything went according to the plan.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, who will serve as national security adviser in the incoming Trump administration, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that \"this deal would have never happened had President Trump not been elected.\"",

Hamas would start releasing hostages on the first day, initially returning three to Israel, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages every seven days, starting with the living, and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During each exchange, Palestinian prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely.",
      "Mr. Biden said Wednesday that Americans would be among the hostages released in the first phase of the agreement, but he did not specify any names or how soon they would be freed.",
      "In phase one, Israel will release at least 1,700 Palestinian prisoners, including 1,167 Gaza residents who were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that sparked the war. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase.",
      "The remainder of the hostages in Gaza, including male Israeli soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "When does fighting stop",

      "In the interim between 8:30 a.m. and when the ceasefire took hold, Israeli fire killed at least 26 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

      "On the first day of the deal, three hostages were to be released by Hamas. On the seventh day, four hostages were to be released. After that, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",

      "\"Catatumbo needs help,\" Villamizar said in a public address on Saturday. \"Boys, girls, young people, teenagers, entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.\"",

      "The plan says that during phase one, some 1,900 Palestinian prisoners will be released, in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages, both alive and dead. Among the prisoners, 1,167 are residents of Gaza who were held by Israel but were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase.",

      "There were also continued Israeli strikes into Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed in the previous day.",
      "Also, during the first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza, along its borders with Israel.",
      "That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza.

      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended on Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country's most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",

They clashed with police, who detained around 40 protesters, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon's arrest.",
      "Yoon's lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody. The lawyers did not share his specific comments.",
      "The judge is expected to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday. Yoon's motorcade was seen leaving the court Saturday evening for the detention center, where Yoon will await the decision.",

      "It hadn't been clear until Saturday morning whether Yoon would choose to attend the hearing.",
      "Defense lawyers met Yoon at the detention center and he accepted his legal team's advice to appear personally before the judge, said Yoon Kab-keun, one of the president's lawyers. The lawyer said the president was to argue that his decree was a legitimate exercise of his powers and that accusations of rebellion would not hold up before a criminal court or the Constitutional Court, which is reviewing whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Nine people, including Yoon's defense minister, police chief, and several top military commanders, have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "If Yoon is formally arrested, it could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",

      "The trial in the case was fast-tracked through India's notoriously sluggish legal system and arguments began in November. It also highlighted once again the chronic issue of violence against women in the country.",
      "After the incident, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding justice and better security for them. Thousands of women across the country also protested on the streets, demanding justice for the victim as they participated in \"Reclaim The Night\" marches.

Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "Still, the number of recorded rape cases in the country has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.",
      "In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.",

      "\"One of the things that I've learned, especially about politics, is you're not going to agree with somebody about everything, and it's OK,\" she said.",
      "\"We've learned to talk through it. Talk it out. Listen to each other. Sometimes, agree to disagree or say, 'Oh, I'm going to think about that and I hear what you're saying,' or 'I don't like the way you're saying it. I wish you'd say it in a different way.'",

      "\"Continued reductions in cancer mortality because of drops in smoking, better treatment and earlier detection is certainly great news,\" said lead author Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director of surveillance research at the ACS in Georgia, in a press release.",
      "\"However, this progress is tempered by rising incidences in young and middle-aged women, who are often the family caregivers, and a shifting cancer burden from men to women, harkening back to the early 1900s, when cancer was more common in women.\"",

      "Cancer death rates dropped 34% between 1991 and 2022, according to the ACS report.",

      "Despite overall declines in mortality, the report revealed that death rates are rising for cancers of the oral cavity, pancreas, uterine corpus and liver (for females).",
      "Some common cancers have also seen an increase in diagnoses, including breast (female), prostate, pancreatic, uterine corpus, melanoma (female), liver (female) and oral cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, the report stated.",

      "Top members of the three branches of government will come together in a rare display of national unity and tradition when the presidential and vice-presidential oaths of office are delivered at Monday's inauguration. A swear-in rookie, and perhaps funny hats, will be indispensable parts of the ceremonies.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh will continue a nearly 240-year-old tradition of administering the oaths to President-elect Trump and his No. 2, JD Vance. The other seven members of the high court are expected to attend the event in the Capitol Rotunda, all in their judicial robes.",
      "Whatever political differences exist, they surely will not be on display at this most cordial and dignified of ceremonies. After all, the first person the president thanks will likely be the chief justice. But an undercurrent of tension remains.",
      "During his first run for high office in 2016, candidate Trump took the unusual step of attacking a member of the federal judiciary, labeling Roberts \"an absolute disaster\" among other personal insults. This will be the \"Chief's\" fifth presidential swearing-in, his second with Trump.",

      "President-elect Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday. (Evan Vucci/AP)",
      "The choice of Kavanaugh is no surprise: incoming second lady Usha Vance clerked for Kavanaugh when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.",
      "She then went on to a prestigious law clerkship at the Supreme Court with Roberts. Sources say Kavanaugh gave an especially strong job recommendation for Usha Vance to his now bench colleague.",
      "In an August interview with \"Fox and Friends,\" Usha Vance said Kavanaugh was \"such a good boss\" and \"decent person\" who \"hired people from all over the political spectrum.\"",
      "\"My experience working for him was overwhelmingly positive,\" she added.",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas are among recent justices who have performed similar vice-presidential swear-in honors.",
      "While chief justices have normally sworn in the president, a broader mix of officials have handled the vice-presidential duties. Then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert swore in Vice President Dick Cheney in 2005.",
      "Thomas did the honors when Mike Pence was sworn in 2017 as vice president for Trump's first term.",
      "TRUMP SWEARING-IN TO MOVE INDOORS DUE TO COLD WEATHER, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS",
      "Article VI of the Constitution requires executive officers, including the president, as well as members of Congress and federal judges, to \"be bound by oath or affirmation,\" but nothing mandates that a Supreme Court justice administer it. When it comes to the presidential inauguration, they just have, most of the time.",
      "There was no Supreme Court yet formed when George Washington took the first oath of office in 1789, so New York's highest ranking judge did the honors at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Four years later, Associate Justice William Cushing swore in Washington for a second term, beginning the Supreme Court tradition.",
      "Early swear-ins were usually conducted in the House or Senate chamber. The 1817 inaugural was held outdoors for the first time when James Monroe took the oath in front of the Old Brick Capitol, where the legislature met temporarily after the original Capitol was burned by invading British troops in the War of 1812. The Monroe swear-in site is now occupied by the Supreme Court, which opened its building in 1935.",
      "The man who handled the duties more than 200 years ago was John Marshall, widely acknowledged as the most influential chief justice in U.S. history. He participated in a record nine swear-ins, from Thomas Jefferson to Andrew Jackson. For Roberts, this will be his fifth.",
      "The Constitution lays out the exact language to be used in the 34-word oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "Many judges have tacked on four little words, \"so help me God.\" It is not legally or constitutionally required, unlike other federal oaths that invoke the words as standard procedure. Historians have been at odds over whether President Washington established precedent by adding the phrase on his own during his first acceptance, but contemporary accounts mention no such ad-libbing.",
      "Abraham Lincoln was reported to have said it spontaneously in 1861, and other presidents over the years have followed suit. A Bible is traditionally used, with the president placing one hand on it while raising the other during the oath of office.",
      "The 16th president and Chief Justice Roger Taney shared a mutual animosity. When the oath was administered just days before the Civil War erupted, many attending the ceremony noticed the frosty demeanor both men showed each other, befitting the late winter chill. Several historians have said Lincoln later that year secretly issued an arrest warrant for Taney, who tried to block the president's suspension of habeas corpus during the conflict. The warrant was never served.",
      "President Barack Obama used Lincoln's Bible for his two swear-ins.",
      "Trump is expected to again use the Lincoln Bible and a family Bible.",

      "TRUMP, VANCE OFFICIAL PORTRAITS RELEASED AHEAD OF INAUGURATION",
      "Roberts, administering his first presidential oath in 2009, strayed slightly from the text, which prompted its re-administration for protective purposes the following day, in a private White House ceremony.",
      "Those Jan. 20 ceremonies at the Capitol also ran long, so that the presidential oath was not completed until five minutes past noon. Nonetheless, Obama under the 20th Amendment had officially assumed the presidency at noon.",
      "At the time, a California atheist, Michael Newdow, objected and went to federal court to prevent Roberts from prompting Obama to repeat the \"so help me God\" phrase. Newdow, along with several non-religious groups, argued the words violated the constitutional ban on government \"endorsement\" of religion.",
      "The high court ultimately rejected the lawsuit, and no such legal challenges are expected this time.",
      "Four years later, Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore in Biden for a second term as vice president in 2013. She was asked by Vice President Harris to do the honors again, with the first female vice president citing the fact both women once served as government prosecutors.",
      "Pence used the family Bible of the late President Ronald Reagan, telling Fox News at the time, \"It's just very humbling for me. We are approaching it with prayer, but with deep, deep gratitude to the president-elect for his confidence and deep gratitude to the American people.\"",
      "Trump also broke tradition by not attending the swear-in of his successor four years ago.",
      "Lyndon Johnson's swear-in from 1965 marked a change from tradition. His wife Claudia \u2013 known as Lady Bird \u2013 held the Bible, a job previously managed by the high court's clerk. Spouses have since had the honor, and Melania Trump and Usha Vance are expected to continue that role.",
      "Hopefully, nerves won't result in a repeat of the 1941 goof, when then-clerk Elmore Cropley dropped the Bible just after Franklin Roosevelt took the oath to begin his third presidential term.",
      "GET TO KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET: WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PICKED SO FAR?",
      "It usually is not hard at the inauguration to spot the justices, who are normally shielded from broad public view in the camera-barred court. They are announced as a group, arrive wearing their black robes \u2013 usually covering bulky winter coats \u2013 and are given prominent seats on the specially built platform on the West Front of the Capitol.",
      "Before Marshall took over the court in 1801, the justices wore red robes with fur trim and white wigs in all public settings. His practice of a simple black silk robe without wig remains the American judicial standard.",
      "And if there is any doubt about their identities, look for some unusual-looking headgear several justices may be sporting. The large black \"skullcaps\" have no brims and can be made of wool, silk or even nylon. Perhaps to keep them from looking like a Jewish yarmulke, the hats are usually pleated upward, which one federal judge privately told Fox News made him look like he was wearing a dirty napkin.",
      "Given the inauguration ceremony is indoors this year because of expected frigid weather, the skullcaps may be an afterthought.",
      "Donald Trump takes the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts on Jan. 20, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",
      "They have been around in British courts since the 16th century, and at least a century in the United States. Only judges wear them, and only at formal ceremonies, not in court.",
      "Official records are hazy on the hats, but Chief Justice Edward White proudly wore one in 1913 when Woodrow Wilson became president. The \"age of the skullcap\" peaked in 1961 when seven of the nine justices wore them at the bitterly cold inauguration of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "The last time around, only now-retired Justice Stephen Breyer was brave enough to sport one, though Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, and the late Antonin Scalia had worn them previously. None of the six current or former women justices ever used them.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Scalia told an audience a few years ago why he favored skullcaps. \"If you've ever seen an inauguration, you will see me wearing the old hats judges used to wear. It's a ridiculous-looking hat, but it's a tradition. Yes, it's silly looking.\"",
      "Scalia's headgear was a replica of one worn by St. Thomas More, a gift from the St. Thomas More Society of Richmond, Virginia",
      "The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist also sported them, not surprising, given his role as an unofficial historian of court procedure and tradition.",
      "He made one of the most dramatic appearances in inaugural history while suffering from thyroid cancer in 2005. There was speculation he would be too ill to attend, but he assured officials he would be there, and he kept his word.",
      "After three months away from the public eye while he received chemotherapy, the ailing 81-year-old chief was introduced to the audience just before President George W. Bush was to take the oath. Using a cane, Rehnquist walked slowly to the podium without assistance \u2013 wearing a dark baseball cap \u2013 and did the honors. His voice was clear but raspy, because of a trachea tube in his throat, which was hidden by a scarf.",
      "Afterward, Rehnquist wished Bush good luck, then was quickly escorted out of the cold.",
      "Rehnquist also swore in President Bill Clinton eight years earlier. Unbeknownst to Clinton or the public, the justices days earlier had taken a private vote in Clinton v. Jones. Their ruling said the president could not refuse to testify in an ongoing civil lawsuit against him by Paula Jones, who alleged sexual harassment. That triggered a series of events leading to Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, presided over by Rehnquist himself, without the skullcap.",

      "President Biden issued five more pardons on Sunday on his last full day in office, including for political activist and Black nationalist Marcus Garvey.",
      "\"America is a country built on the promise of second chances,\" Biden said in a statement. \"As President, I have used my clemency power to make that promise a reality by issuing more individual pardons and commutations than any other President in U.S. history. Today, I am exercising my clemency power to pardon 5 individuals and commute the sentences of 2 individuals who have demonstrated remorse, rehabilitation, and redemption. These clemency recipients have each made significant contributions to improving their communities.\"",
      "In addition to Garvey, the clemency recipients are Darryl Chambers, Ravidath \"Ravi\" Ragbir, Don Leonard Scott, Jr., and Kemba Smith Pradia. Garvey was granted the pardon posthumously.",

      "The Biden White House described Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X, as \"a renowned civil rights and human rights leader who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\"",
      "Former President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927. \"Notably, Mr. Garvey created the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as \u2018the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement\u2019,\" the White House said. \"Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction.\"",

      "Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey. Supporters long argued that Garvey's conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride.",
      "Biden also pardoned Ragbir, an immigrant rights activist, and Smith Pradia, an advocate for criminal justice reform. Ragbir was convicted of a nonviolent offense in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison. Smith Pradia is an advocate convicted of a drug offense in 1994 when she was sentenced to 24 years behind bars. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000.",
      "Biden also announced he is commuting the sentences of 2 additional individuals \u2013 Michelle West and Robin Peoples \u2013 so that their sentences expire\u00a0on Feb.18, 2025.",
      "West was convicted in the '90s on charges that included conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, drug-related homicide and aiding and abetting in drug-related homicide, court records show.",

      "The White House said West \"is currently serving a life sentence for crimes she committed between 1987 and 1993.\"",
      "\"During her three decades of incarceration, Ms. West has demonstrated extraordinary rehabilitation and personal transformation,\" the Biden White House argued. \"Ms. West\u2019s clemency petition has received overwhelming support from the civil rights community, women\u2019s rights advocates, former fellow inmates, and lawmakers. Supporters describe Ms. West as a role model who has built a 31-year record of rehabilitation and redemption.\"",
      "Meanwhile, court records show Peoples was convicted of bank robbery and other associated offenses.",

      "Peoples \"is currently serving a 111-year sentence for crimes he committed in the late 1990s,\" the White House said in their announcement. \"Mr. Peoples would likely face a significantly lower sentence under current law and policy. While in custody, he has demonstrated remarkable rehabilitation and courage. Mr. Peoples\u2019s clemency petition has received overwhelming support from the civil rights community, government officials, friends, and family members. Mr. Peoples\u2019s supporters describe him as a model inmate, an inspiring mentor, and someone deserving of a second chance.\"",
      "It's still not clear whether Biden will use his last full day in office to give pardons to people who have been criticized by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Biden had floated the idea of issuing preemptive pardons for possible offenses by Trump\u2019s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming administration. Doing so would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested ways.",

      "Scammers are taking advantage of this. They have come up with a new trick where they pretend to be recruiters to spread crypto miners on people\u2019s devices.",
      "It starts with an email inviting the person to schedule an interview for a job. But when they click the link, it installs a malicious app that secretly mines cryptocurrency.\u00a0This app hijacks your PC\u2019s resources, like the CPU and GPU, which slows down its performance significantly.",

      "What you need to know",
      "This malicious campaign begins with an email that tricks victims into thinking it is part of a recruitment process, as reported by\u00a0Dark Reading. In most cases, these emails are pretending to be from recruiters at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "The fraudulent email contains a link claiming to take the recipient to a site where they can schedule an interview. However, in reality, it redirects the victim to a malicious website that offers a download for a supposed \"CRM application.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The site provides download options for both Windows and macOS. Regardless of which option the victim selects, the download will be a Windows executable written in Rust. This executable then downloads the XMRig cryptominer.",
      "The executable performs several environmental checks to analyze the device and avoid detection. It scans running processes, checks the CPU and more. If the device passes these checks, the executable will display a fake error message while secretly downloading additional payloads needed to run the XMRig miner.",

      "How does a cryptominer affect your PC?",
      "A cryptomining app can significantly impact your PC\u2019s performance. Once installed, it hijacks your computer's resources, including the CPU and GPU, to secretly mine cryptocurrency. This process requires a lot of computational power, which can cause your system to slow down drastically. You might notice your computer becoming unresponsive, running hotter than usual, or consuming more power.",
      "In some cases, prolonged use of cryptominers can also lead to hardware damage due to the increased strain on your components. Additionally, these miners often run in the background without your knowledge, making it harder to detect the issue until the damage is already done.",
      "CrowdStrike is aware of the scam and advises individuals to stay vigilant.\u00a0\"This campaign highlights the importance of vigilance against phishing scams, particularly those targeting job seekers. Individuals in the recruitment process should verify the authenticity of CrowdStrike communications and avoid downloading unsolicited files,\" the\u00a0company said in a blog post.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from job interview scams",
      "1. Check if you applied for the job: If you receive an unsolicited interview invitation, think back to whether you actually applied for that job or company. Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Cybercriminals always manage to come up with new ways to exploit people. While this particular scam is more focused on using your computer\u2019s resources than stealing data, it is still very dangerous. It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data. Always verify the emails you receive, and try not to download anything you don\u2019t trust.",

Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches.

      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that hackers stole data from Gravy Analytics, a major seller of smartphone location data to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",
      "The hackers are threatening to make the stolen data public. The files contain precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the phone and the time at which the phone was there. Some even indicate what country the data has been collected from.",
      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access.

      "What this breach means for people",
      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",
      "The FTC's recent crackdown on Gravy, announced in December, underscores their negligence. The proposed order will prohibit these companies from selling or using location data, except in specific cases like national security or law enforcement. The implications are worrying. Sensitive locations like schools and workplaces could become easy targets for those with malicious intent.",

      "The Gravy Analytics breach serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerabilities in the digital age. While it\u2019s impossible to control how every company handles data, you can take steps to minimize your exposure and protect your privacy. Here are five actionable tips to stay safe.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough. We need real accountability to deter negligence and protect individual privacy rights.",

      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A lawsuit filed this week accuses Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency of using baseless allegations about a pregnant woman's mental health to secretly investigate her and win custody of her daughter before the baby's birth.",
      "The ACLU of Vermont and Pregnancy Justice, a national advocacy group, filed the lawsuit on Wednesday against the Vermont Department for Children and Families, a counseling center and the hospital where the woman gave birth in February 2022.",
      "In the lawsuit, the state also faces accusations that it routinely tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable to be mothers.",
      "The lawsuit asks for unspecified monetary damages for the woman, who is identified only by her initials, A.V., and an end to what it describes as an illegal surveillance program.",
      "PREGNANT WOMAN AND BABY SAVED AFTER DOCTORS FIND GRAPEFRUIT-SIZED TUMOR: 'EXTREMELY RARE'",
      "A copy of the lawsuit seen against the the Vermont Department for Children and Families.\u00a0 (Google Maps; Vermont Superior Court)",
      "The director of a homeless shelter where A.V. stayed in January 2022 told the child welfare agency that she appeared to have untreated paranoia, dissociative behaviors and PTSD, according to the lawsuit. The state began investigating and eventually spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and a hospital social worker without her knowledge, even though it had no jurisdiction over fetuses.",
      "The woman remained unaware of the probe until she gave birth and her daughter was immediately taken away, according to ACLU senior staff attorney Harrison Stark.",
      "A.V. had no knowledge that hospital officials were giving updates to the state while she was in labor, including details of her cervix dilation, and that she had lost temporary custody of her baby. The state even sought a court order forcing the woman to undergo a cesarean section, although it was rendered moot because she agreed to the surgery.",
      "The woman was not able to win full custody of her child until seven months later.",
      "\"It\u2019s a horrific set of circumstances for our client,\" Stark said. \"It\u2019s also clear from what has happened that this is not the first time the agency has done this. We have learned from several confidential sources that DCF has a pattern and practice of looking into folks like our client who are pregnant, who are of interest to the agency based on a set of unofficial criteria and who the agency is tracking on what is called a 'high risk pregnancy docket' or 'high risk pregnancy calendar.'\"",
      "Department for Children and Families commissioner Chris Winter said the agency will not comment until officials have reviewed the lawsuit and investigated its accusations.",
      "\"We take our mission of protecting children and supporting families seriously and work hard to balance the safety and well-being of children with the rights of parents,\" he said.",
      "Officials at Lund counseling center, which was named as a defendant, said they learned of the allegations from news reports.",
      "The ACLU of Vermont and Pregnancy Justice filed the lawsuit on Wednesday against the Vermont Department for Children and Families, a counseling center and the hospital where the woman gave birth. (Getty Images\u00a0)",
      "\"We take these matters very seriously and we are actively working to gather more information to understand the situation fully,\" interim CEO Ken Schatz said.",
      "Copley Hospital has not commented on the lawsuit.",
      "Several states across the country allow the civil commitment of pregnant women to take custody of a newborn, Pregnancy Justice senior staff attorney Kulsoom Ijaz said. However, it is unclear how common these situations are in the U.S.",
      "Ijaz said what happened to A.V. shows how pregnancy is increasingly used as a justification to block people\u2019s rights.",
      "The organization released a report in September detailing an increase in women being charged with pregnancy-related crimes in the year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws regarding abortion. Most of those cases, in which the baby was listed as the victim, included women charged with child abuse, neglect or endangerment over allegations of substance use during pregnancy.",

      "\"What DCF did here is incredibly cruel,\" Ijaz said. \"It\u2019s discriminatory. Its state sanctioned surveillance and stalking, and it violates Vermont\u2019s newly enshrined right to reproductive autonomy in its state constitution. This is an opportunity for Vermont to signal to other states, as a leader, and say that these rights don\u2019t just exist on paper. They exist in practice, too.\"",
      "Stark said the allegations in Vermont are particularly troubling since the state has described itself as a haven for reproductive rights.",
      "\"To discover evidence that a state agency is essentially colluding with certain medical providers to collect information without folks\u2019 knowledge or consent and expanding its jurisdiction unlawfully to investigate folks based on what are essentially decisions about their own reproductive health is incredibly alarming,\" he said.",

      "Starmer said that the landmark century-long agreement commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war.

    "title": "In an improbable comeback, Trump set to be inaugurated as the 47th president",
    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump will complete his improbable comeback Monday, becoming the first former president to lose and return to power four years later since Glover Cleveland in 1893.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two centuries\u2019 worth of political experience suggests Donald Trump should be sitting behind the lectern Monday watching someone else be sworn in rather than taking the oath himself.",
      "He left the White House after leading a botched attempt to retain power despite his defeat in the 2020 election. Later, he was indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts in a New York criminal case that involved hush money payments to a porn star before the 2016 election.",
      "When he announced three years ago that he would make one more run for the presidency, a normally friendly newspaper, the New York Post, dismissed his latest foray with the cheeky headline, \u201cFlorida Man Makes Announcement\u201d; the story ran on page 26.",
      "That was then.",
      "Trump, 78, will complete his improbable comeback at noon, becoming the first former president to lose re-election and return to power four years later since Glover Cleveland in 1893.",
      "That he\u2019s getting a second term \u2014 and a second chance \u2014 attests to his singular blend of political instinct and perseverance, coupled with the nation\u2019s deep polarization. His loyal base never gave up on him, even when fellow Republican politicians had seen quite enough.",
      "Capitalizing on voters\u2019 frustration with high prices, Trump persuaded them that he \u2014 the billionaire celebrity with the private jet and palatial homes \u2014 was the one candidate who wouldn\u2019t forget them when he regained power.",
      "He swept all seven swing states and, on top of that, won the popular vote. Driving his candidacy were the same character traits that many Democrats found so objectionable: his willingness to flout convention, shatter norms and shake up a federal bureaucracy that seemed unmoored from Americans\u2019 day-to-day concerns.",
      "Millions of voters wanted someone who wouldn\u2019t play nice, and in the often belligerent, foul-mouthed Trump they saw their impolitic champion.",
      "\u201cTrump remained popular because the Republican base still wants to see a pugilist in that role,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \u201cAll odds would have pointed to the Republican Party cutting ties with Trump. But his ability to rally the base \u2014 and keep his finger on the pulse of where most committed Republicans were \u2014 led him to a second term.\u201d",
      "Luck played a part, too. Because he turned his head to peer at a chart at just the right moment, an assassin\u2019s bullet bloodied his ear rather than piercing his skull during a campaign rally last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "Trump faced weak opposition in both the 2016 and \u201924 races. An aged and infirm President Joe Biden abruptly abandoned his campaign in July, leaving his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, just four months to mount a viable candidacy.",
      "\u201cTrump may be the luckiest politician in my lifetime,\u201d Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said. \u201cThe guy is just incredibly lucky!\u201d",
      "Trump will enter office with abundant political capital to spend as he chooses. His party controls both the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., owes his position to Trump. So do many Republican lawmakers who received Trump\u2019s coveted endorsement.",
      "For their part, Democrats are in despair and disarray, with Biden\u2019s approval rating languishing in the 30s and his historical legacy tarnished by his party\u2019s stinging defeat.",
      "\u201cWe became a party that\u2019s out of touch \u2014 that listens and talks to elites,\u201d said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist. \u201cUntil we start actually listening to working- and middle-class Americans about their problems \u2014 and focus on bread-and-butter issues and start talking in a normal way about those issues \u2014 we\u2019re going to face continuing political blowback.\u201d",
      "With Biden bowing out, Trump filled the power vacuum in the interregnum that followed the Nov. 5 election, making pronouncements from his oceanfront resort in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He said he wanted the U.S. to acquire Greenland.",
      "And Canada.",
      "And the Panama Canal.",
      "Hitting the caps lock key on his social media platform, he warned there would be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY\u201d if the hostages held by Hamas weren\u2019t released. He dispatched his Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, to help reach the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that was announced last week.",
      "Watching from foreign capitals, world leaders were back in the posture of deciphering what Trump really meant and planned to do. Were his threats real or merely bluster? The question first posed nine years ago gained renewed urgency: Should Trump be taken seriously, literally or both? A Canadian official surmised that Trump\u2019s call to make Canada the 51st state was a joke \u2014 and a bad one at that.",
      "\u201cWe see this as positioning,\u201d the official said in an interview. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is a businessman and a negotiator, and a lot of the threats have been linked to things around the border that he wants to see changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not become a 51st state. That\u2019s a nonstarter,\u201d the official continued. \u201cAt first, this was seen as a joke. We don\u2019t really see it as funny anymore. The joke has run its expiry date.\u201d",
      "The hardest part begins midday, when the 45th president becomes the 47th. Trump set the bar high for himself, promising a plethora of changes from Day 1.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker on Saturday, Trump said he planned to sign a \u201crecord-setting\u201d number of executive actions upon taking office.",
      "He has vowed to deport massive numbers of immigrants living illegally in the U.S. He said he would bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine within \u201c24 hours\u201d of his inauguration, if not sooner.",
      "When Welker asked him last month if he still planned to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office, Trump said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d",
      "None of this will be easy. Trump\u2019s foreign policy team has not yet laid out a peace proposal to Ukraine\u2019s leadership, sources close to Ukraine\u2019s government told NBC News.",
      "Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment and can\u2019t be undone either by law or executive order, legal experts say.",
      "\u201cOf course it\u2019s not legally permissible to end birthright citizenship either by executive order or by an act of Congress,\u201d said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor emeritus at Harvard University. \u201cOnly a constitutional amendment changing the language of the 14th Amendment could make that fundamental alteration in our national legal and political system.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Trump\u2019s most politically consequential challenge may be  lowering prices. Cumulative inflation under Biden topped 20%, compared to less than 8% in Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 one reason a hopeful electorate put him back in charge.",
      "If Trump can\u2019t give Americans some relief at the gas pump and grocery store, he could face a backlash in the midterm elections in 2026.",
      "Resetting expectations, Trump told Time magazine in an interview a couple of weeks after his victory, \u201cI\u2019d like to bring them [grocery prices] down. It\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up. You know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d",
      "The midterms in 2026 will prove to be a reckoning for Trump. Democrats are hopeful the elections will mark the start of their revival. If they regain control of the House and Senate, they\u2019ll be in a position to thwart Trump\u2019s judicial nominations and legislative agenda. Further, they\u2019d enjoy subpoena power, enabling them to launch investigations into Trump\u2019s dealings. Worried about that prospect, the Republican National Committee is already thinking ahead to the looming elections.",
      "\u201cIf we let Democrats seize back control of the House and the Senate, everything changes,\u201d RNC Chairman Michael Whatley told members at the party\u2019s winter meeting on Friday. \u201cThe radical left will waste no time putting the brakes on President Trump\u2019s agenda. They will resurrect the worst excesses of lawfare that we have dealt with for the last eight years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would see headlines about impeachment proceedings and useless Democrat political stunts,\u201d Whatley added. \u201cWe cannot let that happen again.\u201d",
      "Whatever happens, Trump has already carved a unique place in the long arc of America\u2019s experiment in self-government. Had he lost in November, his first term might have been perceived as a one-off, a reaction to the cautious centrism that his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, symbolized.",
      "His return demonstrated that Trumpism was a genuine and powerful movement. Whether it endures when Trump finally leaves the stage is another question.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s face it. Donald Trump is sui generis,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one out there like him. No one with his mix of bravado, charisma, political instincts and entertainment value on the horizon in either party. It\u2019s hard to imagine Trumpism without Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Hard for Trump to imagine, either. At a campaign stop in Michigan toward the end of the race, he speculated about who might succeed him in 2028.",
      "\u201cIn four years, somebody will come down, and that person\u2019s going to be hot as a pistol,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know what? They\u2019re going to draw about 300 people.\u201d"

      "Trump, who is scheduled to take the oath of office inside the Capitol at noon, intends to sign several of the orders in front of a crowd at an event in Capital One Arena in Washington later in the afternoon. The inauguration-related events were moved to indoor locales because of inclement weather in the nation's capital.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "The first wave of Trump's executive orders, some of which may be rolled out later in the week, are expected to include a mix of campaign trail promises, reversals of outgoing President Joe Biden's policies and a restructuring of the federal workforce.",
      "The most highly anticipated action for many in Trump's MAGA political base is an order declaring a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a broader effort to crack down on illegal immigration and other cross-border crimes.",
      "\"You\u2019re going to see executive orders that are going to make [you] extremely happy, lots of them. ... We have to set our country on the proper course,\" Trump said Sunday at a rally at Capital One Arena. \"By the time the sun sets tomorrow evening, the invasion of our borders will have come to a halt, and all the illegal border trespassers will in some form or another, be on their way back home.\"",
      "During his first term, Trump declared a national emergency to try to redirect Defense Department funding to building a border wall after Congress refused to give him the money he sought for the project. A federal court blocked his plan, which Biden rescinded before the Supreme Court ruled on it.",
      "Trump, who laid out the broad strokes of his plans Sunday at a breakfast with several Republican senators, is also expected to cut off funding for climate-related provisions of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 a move that could test the power of a president to unilaterally withhold congressionally approved funding.",

      "In a phone interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker on Saturday, Trump said he would be signing \"a record-setting number of documents\" after his inauguration speech."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With his political standing at an all-time high, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Monday in the midst of a growing feud among congressional Republicans over how to deliver on his policy agenda.",
      "GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say they will advance Trump\u2019s sweeping plans for immigration, domestic energy and the tax code on party lines. That means squeezing them through the party's wafer-thin House majority and complying with the arcane Senate budget process, in which cutting out Democrats and bypassing filibusters will require limiting the policies to spending and taxes.",
      "\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll begin the largest deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump said Sunday at a victory rally in Washington, where he alluded to the GOP's narrow House majority. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to end the Biden war on energy.\u201d",
      "While Trump promised to begin issuing a flurry of executive orders on day one, they will be constrained by the law and the courts. Making good on many of his promises will depend on action from Congress.",
      "But Republicans are still at odds over how to navigate the thicket of issues they will encounter, including how quickly to pass border funding and complicated questions about tax policy, slashing clean energy grants, lifting the debt ceiling and limiting new red ink.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in an interview.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is determined to move the entire agenda in one massive bill, telling NBC News last week that he plans to pass it through the House by April. But the hard-right House Freedom Caucus disagrees and prefers to split it up into two bills.",
      "Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, plan to pursue a two-track strategy: one smaller bill to boost border security funding and another later in the year for the more complicated pursuits, like extending the expiring Trump tax cuts.",
      "Republican senators say the House could surprise them and succeed by passing one bill. But they doubt it, and if it fails to do so by April, they\u2019ll pressure House Republicans to break up the package and send Trump the low-hanging fruit quickly.",
      "The process debate is just the beginning.",
      "Republicans have to secure virtually unanimous support within their ranks to pass any bill, with their 220-215 House majority set to shrink, at least temporarily, with three expected vacant seats during Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re expecting quite a few battles on immigration,\u201d Durbin said.",

      "The House is \u201cjust a little concerned they can get both of them done in the same year,\u201d he said, referring to the one-bill strategy. \u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019re a little nervous about the border. We\u2019ve got to get something done.\u201d",
      "Tuberville also noted that Republicans will need to figure out how to handle a potential expansion of the federal deductions for state and local taxes (or SALT) \u2014 an issue that has split GOP lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey from most of the party in red-leaning areas \u2014 as well as the debt ceiling.",

    "story": [
      "The last four years\u2019 stunning rebound from the pandemic wasn\u2019t enough to keep a Democrat in the White House. Now Donald Trump is moving back in with many economic winds at his back and a pocketbook-focused electorate watching to see what he\u2019ll do with them.",
      "The economy the president-elect inherits isn\u2019t perfect, but he has eagerly positioned himself as the solution to its flaws.",
      "Unavoidable expenses like housing, child care, health care and more remain punishingly high for countless households, whose frustrations Trump successfully channeled during the campaign \u2014 when he hosted rallies under enormous \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d signs. He has promised to slash energy costs in half within his first year and free up more housing by ejecting millions of immigrants from the country.",
      "However, the costs of many daily goods and services have already slowed sharply while workers\u2019 incomes, on average, have more than made up for the hikes. Since inflation peaked in June 2022 at 9.1%, the annual pace of consumer price increases is now less than 3%, where it has hovered for months just above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target rate.",
      "But December\u2019s 2.9% reading is the latest sign that the last mile of the inflation road can be bumpy.",
      "Price increases have accelerated in the Biden administration\u2019s final months after having touched 2.4% in September, the lowest level since February 2021. Food costs have risen every month since August, stalling after dramatic improvement earlier last year. Indeed, having relentlessly highlighted grocery prices on the stump, Trump said after the election that bringing them down further would be \u201cvery hard.\u201d",
      "A surge in energy prices fueled 40% of inflation\u2019s gains last month, though they\u2019re still a bit cheaper than a year ago. The uptick was driven mainly by gasoline and fuel oil in a season when utility bills are expected to jump nearly 9% from steeper home heating costs.",
      "It\u2019s ironic, meanwhile, that efforts to lower inflation could be hampered by the underlying strength in the labor market and the economy overall.",
      "Looking to cement its record, the Biden administration released a Treasury Department analysis last week emphasizing that \u201clabor market, household, and business indicators are all at levels typical of economic booms, with some \u2014 including the prime-age (ages 25 to 54) labor force participation rate, median household wealth, and business applications \u2014 at or near historic highs.\u201d",
      "Monetary policymakers at the Fed, who are doubtless watching those measures closely, have historically trimmed interest rates to goose a flagging economy. But with things broadly humming along, they\u2019re keenly aware that goosing it too soon, or by too much, could undo hard-won progress and send prices higher again.",
      "What happens next also depends on the policies Trump implements shortly after he takes the oath of office for a second time.",
      "He has indicated his tax and immigration crackdown proposals are top priorities. Business executives are eager for the former, especially plans to pair a lower corporate tax rate with deregulation. Economists say Trump\u2019s vow to detain and deport millions of undocumented people could send tremors through major industries that rely heavily on immigrant laborers, especially agriculture, health care and construction.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff plans are another wild card that threatens to ratchet up diplomatic tensions with allies and rivals alike and raise costs for businesses from tech startups to craft breweries and bicycle makers. Given such unknowns, market experts are dialing back expectations for the pace of further interest rate cuts by the Fed.",
      "\u201cWe believe the resiliency of the U.S. labor market, stickiness in inflation and uncertainty emanating from federal economic policy will keep the FOMC on hold for the next several months,\u201d Wells Fargo economists wrote recently in a note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Economists at BNP Paribas even see the Fed on hold for the rest of the year. \u201cWe continue to expect no cuts in 2025 based on an inflationary upsurge from the new administration\u2019s policies,\u201d they wrote to clients. That would keep borrowing costs uncomfortably high for credit cards, car loans and a variety of other rates tied to the Fed\u2019s benchmark. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, on which mortgage rates are based, has been rising, too.",
      "And then there\u2019s simply the national mood. Trump earned most voters\u2019 trust to handle the economy better than his predecessor. But he\u2019ll have his work cut out for him turning around a persistently sour outlook shared by millions of people, despite long-running partisan gaps on the matter.",
      "\u201cInflation is improving, but most people don\u2019t agree,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments. He added that there\u2019s also the potential for conflict between Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has said he won\u2019t try to remove from atop the central bank before Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026.",
      "\u201cTrump undoubtedly thought he would get a few interest rate cuts in 2025, but he may not get any \u2014 or just one or two,\u201d Valliere said. \u201cHe and Powell have a history of feuds, and that may re-erupt if the Fed refuses to cut rates.\u201d",
      "Still, context is critical. Inflation clocked in at 2.9% on average over last year as a whole, slower than 2023\u2019s full-year rate of 3.3% and below the long-term average of 3.5%, according to Charles Schwab investment strategist Kevin Gordon.",
      "That\u2019s a favorable trend, but it can be difficult for people to see unfolding in the worlds where they live, work, shop and vote \u2014\u00a0or for politicians to continue after having swept into office promising change."

      "TikTok said Sunday that it would be restoring service to U.S. users after blocking it the evening before.",
      "In a statement, TikTok said its video platform was coming back online after President-elect Donald Trump provided the necessary assurances to the company\u2019s service providers.",
      "\u201cIn agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,\u201d TikTok said in a post on X. \u201cWe thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States,\u201d the company added.",
      "Just hours before TikTok blocked service to Americans, Trump posted to Truth Social calling for it to remain available.",
      "Trump indicated that he wanted it to be available to broadcast his inauguration on Monday.",
      "\u201cI will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Follow along for live updates.",
      "TikTok\u2019s availability came back in spurts Sunday afternoon, with access to its content first becoming available through web browsers. Later in the day, it became usable for some, and it welcomed users back with the message \"Welcome back! Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.! You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok.\"",
      "The app was still unavailable for download from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores.",
      "The law banning TikTok, which was scheduled to go into effect Sunday, allows the president to grant a 90-day extension before the ban is enforced, provided certain criteria are met.",
      "Under a law that President Joe Biden signed in April, TikTok would be banned unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sold the company to a non-Chinese buyer.",
      "Prior to the ban\u2019s implementation, both Biden and the incoming Trump administration appeared to reverse their earlier positions on TikTok.",
      "During his campaign, Trump, who had advocated for a ban during his first term as president, came out in support of TikTok, saying he\u2019d save it.",
      "After the Supreme Court greenlit the law on Friday, the Biden administration issued a statement saying it would not enforce the ban, leaving that responsibility to Trump.",
      "On Saturday evening, the app was removed from app stores and service for American users was suspended.",
      "TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. is still up in the air.",
      "After TikTok came back online, some Republicans appeared to contradict Trump on how things might play out. House Speaker Mike, R-La., Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, \"I think we will enforce the law,\u201d adding, \"When President Trump issued the Truth [Social] post and said, \u2018Save TikTok,\u2019 the way we read that is that he\u2019s going to try to force along a true divestiture, changing of hands, the ownership.\u201d",
      "Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., also issued a statement celebrating the ban, and saying they don't see a basis for an extension like Trump has proposed.",
      "\"Now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of \u2018extension\u2019 of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law\u2019s qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China,\u201d the statement said in part.",
      "Even if TikTok is given an extension, as Trump has vowed to do in an executive order Monday, the law still forces ByteDance to eventually sell it to a non-Chinese owner \u2014\u00a0which the parent company has shown no interest in doing.",
      "TikTok said in its latest statement that it \u201cwill work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture for TikTok, with the U.S. owning 50%, but even that idea faces a potential hurdle. The law includes a 20% cap for \u201cforeign adversary\u201d owners, so it\u2019s not immediately clear whether ByteDance could exceed that ownership share without a change in the law.",
      "The law defines \u201ccontrolled by a foreign adversary\u201d in several different ways, but one definition is: \u201can entity with respect to which a foreign person or combination of foreign persons ... directly or indirectly own at least a 20 percent stake.\u201d",
      "Congress, of course, could change the law."

    "summary": "Notre Dame and Ohio State will play for the national championship on Monday. And both used the transfer portal to find their starting quarterbacks.",
    "story": [
      "ATLANTA \u2014 Four years ago, as Riley Leonard entered his senior season of high school football in Fairhope, Ala., he received such little recruiting interest that the deeply religious 6-foot-4 quarterback began to consult a higher power in his search for a college scholarship.",
      "\u201cI remember sitting in my room and praying at night like, 'Jesus, Lord, would you please just give me something, give me an offer?\u201d Leonard said.",
      "Duke University eventually answered that prayer and a few years later, Leonard attended a famed summertime academy for quarterbacks in Louisiana run by Archie Manning, the former NFL quarterback and father of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Peyton and Eli. At the academy, Leonard roomed with Will Howard, the starting quarterback at Kansas State who, like Leonard, shared a similar backstory. Each was a three-star high school prospect out of a possible five who, passed over by the country\u2019s most tradition-rich schools, had instead proved himself as a starter at a middle-tier program.",
      "At the camp, Leonard and Howard stayed up late talking.",
      "\u201cLife, and who we are as people and families and our goals in the future and things like that,\u201d Leonard recalled. \u201cSo it was just a genuine conversation. We were both kind of underdogs at the time.\u201d",
      "No longer. One year after Leonard transferred from Duke to Notre Dame and Howard left Kansas State in favor of Ohio State, one of the quarterbacks will leave Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium  as a national champion when the College Football Playoff ends Monday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy now looking back at it, when we first met to where we are now, it\u2019s cool,\u201d Howard said.",
      "Quarterbacks in the national title game traditionally reached that vaunted stage as either a former top recruit, or by waiting their turn as a backup, learning a school\u2019s system for a season or two before taking over, and sometimes both. One-season superstars like Cam Newton, who led Auburn to the 2010 national title in his only season at the school, were the outliers.",
      "Leonard and Howard, however, are the faces of a new era of college football \u2014 one in which winning a national championship has never been more accessible to a wider range of quarterbacks.",
      "Aided by relaxed rules that now allow athletes who transfer between schools to play immediately and the landmark shift in 2021 that allowed athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, quarterbacks who prove their ability at smaller programs are now quickly snapped up at major powerhouses who, rather than entrust their success to an unproven, young starter, often opt to find their new QB in the transfer market.",
      "Notre Dame and Ohio State\u2019s coaches said the backbone of their rosters remains signing top high schoolers, but when it came time to find a new starter at their most important position last winter, both opted for a transfer neither would have likely recruited out of high school.",
      "\u201cThe foundation of our football program will be from high school recruiting, and we\u2019ll minor in the transfer portal for specific needs,\u201d Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said.",
      "Leonard landed at Notre Dame two months after he suffered a season-ending injury against the Irish.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with Notre Dame after that game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cShoot, here we are. It\u2019s a crazy story.\u201d",

      "The Lions and Commanders put on a slugfest for the ages. Here are the wildest highlights.",
      "Howard and Leonard aren\u2019t outliers. In this year\u2019s 12-team College Football Playoff, the top seed, Oregon, was quarterbacked by Dillon Gabriel, a former three-star prospect from Hawaii whose production at Central Florida in the pre-NIL era led to a transfer to Oklahoma in 2023, and then Oregon this season.",
      "Such transfers to top programs can expect a lucrative NIL package. Nebraska coach Matt Rhule estimated\u00a0in 2023\u00a0that a \u201cgood\u201d transfer quarterback could command between $1 million and $2 million in NIL. Those figures are likely conservative; this fall, the nation\u2019s top quarterback in the 2025 recruiting class\u00a0reportedly agreed\u00a0to an eight-figure deal to commit to Michigan.",
      "\u201cYeah, the NIL is nice,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice add-on, but it wasn\u2019t why I came here.\u201d",
      "The move also includes a learning curve, however. Transfers arrive with talent, but lack trust.",
      "\u201cI hated being in the transfer portal,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt was honestly a very uncomfortable situation for me. I like to think of myself as a loyal person, but whenever I had to choose to leave Duke, I understood the repercussions that came with that.\u201c",
      "But whenever I got here, these guys just welcomed me in because I came here on crutches my first day here. I was actually on a scooter and crutches, and these guys welcomed me with open arms. So it wasn\u2019t really me trusting them, it was more them trusting me because it\u2019s hard to have a big-time transfer quarterback come in and he has three surgeries since the time he gets there, like that\u2019s hard to trust.\u201d",
      "Said Howard: \u201cComing from a place where you\u2019re there for four years and you\u2019re very comfortable and you know everyone, coming into a new system where you have to kind of -- I didn\u2019t know anyone\u2019s name. I\u2019m just learning everybody\u2019s name when I first got here.\u201d",
      "Few college football fans knew either quarterback\u2019s name when they left high school. But on Monday, as the era of player movement continues across college sports, one will be known as a national champion."

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:13:17 GMT",
    "summary": "An insurance pool created by officials in California to help residents in wildfire-prone areas could frustrate victims of the L.A. wildfire.",
    "story": [
      "When a massive wildfire tore through Sarah Mapel\u2019s Northern California neighborhood in the late summer of 2020, she considered herself lucky. Firefighters saved her historic home, built in 1898, using water from a nearby creek.",
      "But making her ash- and toxin-filled home safe to live in again turned into an epic, yearslong legal battle with her insurer: the California FAIR Plan Association. An insurance pool created by state officials in 1968, the plan offers coverage to residents and business owners in wildfire-prone and other vulnerable areas who cannot obtain coverage from private insurers.",
      "Mapel\u2019s problems with FAIR Plan began when her insurer sent her a $1,151 check for a repair estimate on her home that exceeded $50,000, documents show. For months, other challenges and frustrations followed.",
      "Thousands of victims of the costliest wildfires in Los Angeles\u2019 history could soon face the same maddening process and meager coverage. More than 3,600 policyholders in Altadena, Pacific Palisades and other parts of greater Los Angeles have submitted claims to the FAIR Plan to try to recover some of what they\u2019ve lost, it said in a Friday update. Mapel has some advice for them: Get ready for a fight.",
      "In addition, all FAIR Plan policyholders may have to pay fees to the participating insurers thanks to a policy change issued last July by Ricardo Lara, California\u2019s insurance commissioner. Under a deal struck by Lara and the insurance companies that run FAIR, insurers will be able to collect money from policyholders to recoup half of any assessed losses up to $2 billion as a way to \u201cmodernize\u201d and \u201cstabilize\u201d the operation.",
      "The new rule was part of a package designed to safeguard the FAIR Plan\u2019s financial stability, itself part of a broader initiative Lara calls the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, said Michael Soller, a spokesman for the state Insurance Department, in a statement. But it means all FAIR Plan policyholders, not just those affected by the recent wildfires, will likely pay some of the damage costs they assumed the insurer would shoulder.",
      "Property owners have long expressed frustration with how private insurance companies handle damage claims made after fires, hurricanes or other catastrophes. But many consumers dealing with the California FAIR Plan have experienced significant problems simply getting paid for losses, an NBC News investigation found.",
      "The plan also discloses little information about its operations to the public or even the state\u2019s Department of Insurance. And a 2022 assessment by the department shows that in recent decades the plan appears to have been profitable for the insurance companies running it, a situation that frustrated policyholders find galling.",
      "Launched with good intentions",
      "California is the largest insurance market in the country, but wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters have generated losses for some property and casualty insurance companies there. In recent years, some insurers have dropped customers in high-risk areas or stopped doing business in the state altogether, forcing residents to rely increasingly on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The plan provides coverage for those who can\u2019t obtain insurance from private insurance companies and only covers losses caused by fire or lightning, internal explosion and smoke. It caps residential policies at $3 million.",
      "Like some other states\u2019 FAIR plans, California\u2019s was created by the governor and state Legislature in 1968 when urban areas were on fire amid civil unrest. As insurers fled these neighborhoods, states set up what they called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plans to guarantee that residents in areas abandoned by private insurers could protect their properties.",
      "There are 33 FAIR plans across the U.S., according to the\u00a0National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\u00a0The plans are funded by private insurance companies doing business in the states, and those companies share in FAIR Plan profits, losses and expenses in amounts proportional to their market shares in the states."

      "\u201cI think people are scared right now for what is to come with the new administration,\u201d the Rev. Tanya Lozano Washington said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to explore every single option to continue to protect our community members that are vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials\u00a0were planning a major enforcement operation\u00a0that would target immigrants for several days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to a document reviewed by NBC News and a person familiar with the planning. Tom Homan, the incoming border czar,\u00a0said Saturday\u00a0that the administration hadn\u2019t \u201cmade a decision yet\u201d after news of the planned operation began to leak.",
      "Chicago will not be the first city to see mass deportations begin, two sources with knowledge of the plans told NBC News Sunday night, after the operation in the city was postponed (but not canceled) due to media leaks.",
      "Still, the fight over illegal immigration in Chicago has the potential to be among the fiercest nationwide during the initial weeks of Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 and it could be a microcosm of an unprecedented ramp-up of immigration enforcement, one of the major themes of Trump's 2024 campaign.",

Last week, a debate exploded at the City Council over a proposal to water down Chicago\u2019s sanctuary city ordinance protecting undocumented immigrants. It voted 39-11 to prevent a vote on an amendment proposed by Aldermen Raymond Lopez and Silvana Tabares, which would have allowed the Chicago Police Department to work with federal immigration authorities in cases in which undocumented immigrants have been arrested or convicted of certain crimes.",
      "\u201cThe left is coming after folks like myself who are trying to find a middle ground,\u201d Lopez, a Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not trying to make Donald Trump the enemy for the next four years to win my re-election. I\u2019m trying to protect people in the community.\u201d",
      "Under the Welcoming City Ordinance, Chicago police aren\u2019t allowed to ask people about their immigration status or cooperate in any federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "After the proposal to chip away at the policy failed, Mayor Brandon Johnson lamented \u201cthe fear that has found its way in the city of Chicago because of the threats that are coming from the incoming administration. People of Chicago can rest assured that the full force of government will do everything in its power to protect the residents of the city.\u201d",
      "Critics of Lopez\u2019s proposal said that it\u2019s unclear how the certain crimes would be specifically defined and that the proposal would raise due process concerns.",
      "\u201cThey are lying to the public for their own political agenda,\u201d he said.",
      "Lopez drew the ire of Democrats to his political left by meeting with Homan, the incoming border czar.",
      "\u201cI think that we are on the same page: that if he has the opportunity just to focus on the criminals, that is more than enough to keep him busy for the next four years,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Homan has repeatedly\u00a0blasted Chicago leaders as a war of words has escalated after Trump\u2019s re-election, arguing Democrats are the reason Chicago\u00a0is in \u201ctrouble.\u201d",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker responded to Homan\u2019s threats at a news conference last month.",
      "\u201cWe have laws that protect undocumented immigrants, and we\u2019re going to follow the law. I\u2019m concerned that the Trump administration and his lackeys aren\u2019t,\u201d Pritzker said, though he did add that \u201cviolent criminals who are undocumented and convicted of violent crime should be deported.\u201d",
      "Since Trump was last in office, Illinois has gone even further in its efforts to protect people who are there without legal status by strengthening\u00a0the TRUST Act, which instituted extensive guidelines restricting law enforcement agencies statewide from assisting in matters related to federal civil immigration law.",
      "Morrison, the Republican county commissioner, argued that sanctuary policies break federal law and undermine the sovereignty of the nation.",
      "\u201cI do think that there will be a showdown here,\u201d he said."

    "title": "Wine sales drying up as Americans turn elsewhere",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "U.S. wine sales continued a multiyear decline in 2024, which experts attribute to shifting demographics, health concerns, new competition and economic forces.",
    "story": [
      "The losses keep stacking up for the U.S. wine industry.",
      "Wine sales in the U.S. last year tumbled approximately 6% from 2023, according to data from the industry data group SipSource. The drop is the latest in a long-term decline in wine demand in restaurants, bars and stores that some are calling an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the industry.",
      "Wine isn\u2019t the only alcoholic drink that\u2019s fallen on hard times; data from NIQ shows sales for beer, cider and spirits have also decreased. But wine\u2019s fall is steeper, and the whole industry is aware of the shift.",
      "\u201cWines have been surging, surging, surging all these years, but the last few years they have dropped off,\u201d said Larry Duke, who has owned and operated Schumer\u2019s Wine and Liquor in Manhattan since 1978.",
      "The wine industry got a boost in 2020 when Covid-fueled lockdowns and stay-at-home orders juiced demand. But that spike has proved to be fleeting.",
      "Wine industry scholar Mike Veseth, author of several books and The Wine Economist newsletter, pointed to generational trends to explain the drop in wine consumption.",
      "\u201cThe baby boom generation embraced wine,\u201d Veseth said. \u201cWe imagined that the generations that followed would keep doing that, but they haven\u2019t.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Gallup poll backed up that theory, showing that younger Americans drank less than previous generations.",
      "The drop in demand comes as a second Gallup poll, from August, shows that more than 4 in 10 Americans now think alcohol is unhealthy. The U.S. surgeon general issued a report on Jan. 3 warning that alcoholic drinks should carry cancer warning labels.",
      "Experts say when younger consumers do indulge, they are choosing premixed, ready-to-drink options. In fact, premixed beverages are one of few areas in the alcohol industry to see growth.",
      "Wine, which comes in a large bottle and may require a corkscrew or extra glasses, is at a disadvantage compared to the convenience of premixed drinks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that they dislike wine,\u201d said Christian Miller, research director for the Wine Market Council, a research-focused nonprofit. \u201cIt\u2019s that they are drinking a much wider variety of other things.\u201d",
      "Gary Decker, owner of Vinomania in Syracuse, New York, said legal marijuana has also drawn away demand for wine.",
      "\u201cPot is taking a big chunk out of it because it\u2019s just another part of the party puzzle,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIt\u2019s one other thing that people can do.\u201d",
      "Adding to the list of obstacles: nonalcoholic beers and spirits. Industry data shows a marked recent uptick in sales in the sector.",
      "Nonalcoholic beverages are advantageous not just for those who are wary of the health risks of alcohol, but also for the businesses serving them.",
      "\u201cRetailers love them,\u201d said Bump Williams, who runs an alcoholic beverage industry consulting business and has worked in the industry for at least three decades. \u201cIf a retailer sees one of their patrons that has had too much to drink, they can give them a water and they don\u2019t make any money on that. Instead, they can give them a nonalcoholic mixed cocktail.\u201d",
      "Nonalcoholic wines have yet to catch up.",
      "\u201cDe-alcoholized beer is booming, and the quality of the best de-alcoholized beer is excellent,\u201d Veseth said. \u201cWine is lagging.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you replicate the taste?\u201d asked Dale Stratton, an industry veteran who is a managing director at a consultancy that focuses on the wine business. \u201cI just haven\u2019t seen a solution in the wine category that effectively does that.\u201d",
      "Wine is one of the most expensive choices of alcohol and has been getting more expensive. Since the start of the century, the average cost per liter of wine has increased from $10 to $14.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s budgets are just really tight these days,\u201d Veseth said. \u201cSo wine is feeling the crunch.\u201d",
      "These factors signal hard times for the wine industry, though experts are split on how bad the trouble will be.",
      "\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Veseth said. \u201cIt\u2019s an existential problem. Although the industry will continue, there are big adjustments needed for that to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cWine has been here forever,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cThe wine category is going to continue to be here. And while there\u2019s some challenges that we\u2019re facing right now, the wine category has been here forever and will continue to be.\u201d",
      "While the industry may be slow to adjust to these challenges, winemakers aren\u2019t ready to give in.",
      "\u201cIs it really time to retire an 8,000-year-old human beverage?\u201d said California winemaker Martha Stoumen, who owns Martha Stoumen Wines. \u201cReally? Are we gonna let it go extinct? That seems like we might want to think about that as a culture.\u201d"

      "But, capitalizing on a weak opposition, the nation\u2019s polarization and voters\u2019 frustration with high prices, Trump persuaded them that he \u2014 the billionaire celebrity\u00a0\u2014 was the one candidate who wouldn\u2019t forget them when he regained power. He swept all seven swing states and, on top of that, won the popular vote.

      "\u201cI have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,\u201d Debra Tice said. \u201cHis people have already reached out to me. I haven\u2019t experienced that for the last four years.\u201d",
      "Austin Tice, now 43, was one of the first American journalists to report on the Syrian civil war that began in 2011 before his disappearance in 2012. The State Department\u00a0contended he was being held by the Syrian government. Former President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government vehemently\u00a0denied the accusation.",
      "Debra Tice last visited Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with the Syrian authorities, who never confirmed if her son was in their custody before they stopped granting her visas.",
      "In December, U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens traveled to Lebanon to seek more information on Austin Tice\u2019s whereabouts, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge who spoke to NBC News. \u201cWe think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,\u201d Biden told reporters.",
      "At the time, Tice's mother told \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d that she had received intel just before the Assad government\u2019s collapse that her son was alive and being well taken care of, adding that it was only a matter of time until the family would be reunited.",
      "There has been no clarity on Austin\u2019s whereabouts since then, but the journalist's mother on Monday told reporters that the Trump administration had already reached out to her to help.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working closely with his new team, including national security advisor Mike Waltz and Special Presidential Envoy Adam Boehler,\u201d she said.",
      "Tice's media conference came a day after she met with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of Syria's new government and the rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad last month. She expressed that the new authorities can help uncover more information about Austin.",
      "\u201cDuring my time in Damascus, I have been privileged to meet with the new leadership of Syria. It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined to bring home my son,\u201d she said on Monday.",
      "\u201cHe came here as a journalist to tell the story of the Syrian people to the world, and in the process, fell in love with his beautiful country,\u201d Tice said, adding, \u201cI have fallen in love with this beautiful country.\u201d",
      "While Tice's visit coincided with the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, about whom she had warm words, she has expressed contrasting opinions on the outgoing Biden administration in recent months for not negotiating hard enough for her son\u2019s release.",
      "Tice, who returns to the U.S. Tuesday, said she would \u201cwait and pray and let the dust settle from all these page turns\u201d for now."

      "WEF says this year\u2019s event \u2014 the 55th annual forum, which runs from Monday to Thursday \u2014 will convene close to 3,000 leaders from over 130 countries, with the gathering \u201cdemonstrating the critical need for dialogue in an increasingly uncertain era.\u201d It notes that 350 government leaders, including 60 heads of state and governments, \u201cwill gather in Davos-Klosters to address pressing challenges and shape emerging opportunities.\u201d",

Russia has not been welcomed for some years now, Keir Starmer is not going to be there. Macron\u2019s not going to be there,\u201d Jan\u00a0Aart\u00a0Scholte, professor of global transformations and governance challenges at Leiden University, told CNBC Thursday.",
      "\u201cTrue, the prime minister of Spain is going to be there and there are a couple of others, but the general picture of the heads of state, of government that are there is that it\u2019s not the big players. I think if you went through a list of the G20, it\u2019s going to be a small minority [who are attending],\u201d he said.",
      "Collective effort",
      "There is often no official reason given for a lack of participation in WEF, but pressing domestic problems \u2014 ranging from slowing economic growth to political crises \u2014 are known to keep heads of government at home.",
      "In recent years, there has also been some ambivalence over attending an event that has been accused of being elite and out-of-touch.",
      "The forum has repeatedly stated that it provides a space where stakeholders from across business, government, academia, civil society, media and the arts can \u201cmeet on a global, impartial, not-for-profit platform.\u201d",
      "These people, it says, \u201ccome together to find common ground and seize opportunities for positive change on large global issues.\u201d",

      "The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will likewise attend, as will the leaders of global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization.",
      "Sven Smit, a senior partner at strategic WEF partner\u00a0McKinsey\u00a0& Company, said in online comments that it would be a priority for participants to \u201cunderstand what is on the mind of the leaders who are at Davos.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully predict it, there are themes out there that people suggest, they range from growth to sustainability, but what distils as a Davos theme is not fully predictable and that\u2019s the interesting part,\u201d Smit said.",
      "However, many of the Western institutions in attendance have, in recent years, found themselves on the wrong side of a push against globalization by populist leaders like Trump, and countries like Russia and China.",
      "WEF, too, has fallen foul of this anti-establishment trend, Scholte noted, and while the presence of leaders like Trump might not have been sought out in the past, there is now an acceptance that the world has changed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that the promoters of a liberal, open world economy speak with quite as much disdain, let\u2019s say, of contrary forces and views as they might have done, say, before the global financial crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bit more modesty that, no, it sometimes doesn\u2019t fully work. And no, we haven\u2019t always taken sufficient account of those who feel excluded from this.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he stressed that WEF was still a draw for many business and political leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are various indicators that a site like the World Economic Forum isn\u2019t as strong a magnet as it might have been a couple of decades ago,\u201d Scholte said. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s no longer a magnet, and the idea that it also doesn\u2019t have certain areas within world economic governance where it can still be very strong, I think that would be wrong.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With his political standing at an all-time high, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Monday in the midst of a growing feud among congressional Republicans over how to deliver on his policy agenda.",
      "GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say they will advance Trump\u2019s sweeping plans for immigration, domestic energy and the tax code on party lines. That means squeezing them through the party's wafer-thin House majority and complying with the arcane Senate budget process, in which cutting out Democrats and bypassing filibusters will require limiting the policies to spending and taxes.",
      "\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll begin the largest deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump said Sunday at a victory rally in Washington, where he alluded to the GOP's narrow House majority. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to end the Biden war on energy.\u201d",
      "While Trump promised to begin issuing a flurry of executive orders on day one, they will be constrained by the law and the courts. Making good on many of his promises will depend on action from Congress.",
      "But Republicans are still at odds over how to navigate the thicket of issues they will encounter, including how quickly to pass border funding and complicated questions about tax policy, slashing clean energy grants, lifting the debt ceiling and limiting new red ink.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in an interview.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is determined to move the entire agenda in one massive bill, telling NBC News last week that he plans to pass it through the House by April. But the hard-right House Freedom Caucus disagrees and prefers to split it up into two bills.",
      "Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, plan to pursue a two-track strategy: one smaller bill to boost border security funding and another later in the year for the more complicated pursuits, like extending the expiring Trump tax cuts.",
      "Republican senators say the House could surprise them and succeed by passing one bill. But they doubt it, and if it fails to do so by April, they\u2019ll pressure House Republicans to break up the package and send Trump the low-hanging fruit quickly.",
      "The process debate is just the beginning.",
      "Republicans have to secure virtually unanimous support within their ranks to pass any bill, with their 220-215 House majority set to shrink, at least temporarily, with three expected vacant seats during Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",
      "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, whose committee will write the border security and immigration enforcement section, said he expects it to cost about $80 billion to $100 billion.",

      "She didn\u2019t have an estimate of the cost or savings Republicans will find on energy, describing the numbers as \u201call over the board.\u201d",

      "The House is \u201cjust a little concerned they can get both of them done in the same year,\u201d he said, referring to the one-bill strategy. \u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019re a little nervous about the border. We\u2019ve got to get something done.\u201d",
      "Tuberville also noted that Republicans will need to figure out how to handle a potential expansion of the federal deductions for state and local taxes (or SALT) \u2014 an issue that has split GOP lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey from most of the party in red-leaning areas \u2014 as well as the debt ceiling.",

Because what they tell us depends on what we can do. So I can\u2019t do anything until they pass their budget resolution.\u201d"

The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "The statement concluded by saying \"the strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\"",

      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement to TODAY.com that the lawsuit was \"a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team\u2019s duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth,\" he said.",
      "\"Ms. Lively will never again be allowed to continue to exploit actual victims of real harassment solely for her personal reputation gain at the expense of those without power,\" he continued. \"Let\u2019s not forget, Ms. Lively and her team attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons through their own dangerous manipulation of the media before even taking any actual legal action. We know the truth, and now the public does too. Justin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what Baldoni accuses Lively of in the complaint related to allegations of \u201cbreach of contract, extortion, defamation and further wrongdoing.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively insisted on oversight of her character\u2019s costume",
      "Lively, who was hired as an actor to play Lily Bloom in the film, allegedly insisted on control over her character's costume before filming even began, according to the complaint.",
      "Baldoni alleges that Lively's actions led the costume designer to re-shop her wardrobe, \"far exceeding the allocated budget and diverting time and resources, while also preparing wardrobes for the rest of the cast,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively spoke about her involvement with the costumes during the press tour for the film, including with TODAY's Sheinelle Jones.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cTo me, fashion and costume design is storytelling.\u201d",
      "Lively wrote a draft of the rooftop scene, then said Reynolds wrote it at the film's premiere, lawsuit says",
      "During production, Lively asked Baldoni if she could \"take a pass\" at writing one of the scenes in the film, where Lily and Baldoni's character, Ryle, meet on the rooftop of his apartment building, the complaint states.",
      "Baldoni alleges the draft of the scene Lively wrote significantly differed from the original version, and that he thanked her for her passion and said that the final scene would likely end up being somewhere between her version and the original version.",
      "Lively did not respond and went silent for multiple days afterward, according to the complaint.",
      "In text messages, Lively referred to a meeting she called at her penthouse, in which Reynolds greeted Baldoni and gave his wife praise for her version of the scene, the complaint says.",
      "\"Hours later, as the meeting was ending, a famous, and famously close, friend of Reynolds and Lively, walked into the room and similarly began praising Lively\u2019s script,\" the complaint says. \"Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively\u2019s direction for the script.\"",
      "In one of the messages, Baldoni refers to the friend as \"Taylor,\" but the name is redacted in other messages. (Baldoni's team confirmed this was a reference to Taylor Swift; the pop star has not commented.)",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint did not have details on this specific alleged meeting.",
      "Later, during a red carpet interview, Lively said her husband had written the scene, according to the complaint.",
      "\"This was also the first time that Plaintiffs learned that Reynolds \u2014 who had no formal role whatsoever in the Film\u2019s production \u2014 had made unauthorized changes to the script in secret,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "Baldoni explains why he asked for Lively's weight",
      "Lively introduced Baldoni to the person who would become his personal trainer, according to the complaint.",
      "During production, Baldoni privately reached out to the trainer to ask what Lively's weight was so that he could properly prepare his back muscles for a scene in which he had to lift her up, according to the complaint. (Baldoni has suffered from lifelong back injuries, according to the complaint.)",
      "The next day, Lively asked Baldoni to come to her penthouse, where he was greeted by Reynolds, who swore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cHow dare you f------- ask about my wife\u2019s weight?\" Reynolds asked Baldoni, according to the complaint. \"What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d",
      "Baldoni offered what are described in the lawsuit as \u201crepeated (and completely unwarranted)\u201d apologies, and Reynolds demanded that the scene be removed entirely, according to his complaint. Lively allegedly refused to perform the scene, even after it was rehearsed with a stunt double, according to the complaint.",
      "In Lively\u2019s original complaint, she alleges that weeks after she gave birth to her fourth child, Baldoni \u201csecretly called her fitness trainer without her knowledge or permission and implied that he wanted her to lose weight in two weeks\u201d because he was concerned about picking her up in a scene. She said in her complaint that \"there was no such scene.\"",
      "Later, according to Baldoni's complaint, Lively delivered an ultimatum: \"If Baldoni could not get on board with her work methods, he had two weeks to recast her.\"",
      "Baldoni's attorneys say a 17-point document brought by Lively was 'essentially signed under duress'",
      "After filming was paused due to multiple strikes, production was set to begin again once the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, according to the complaint.",
      "\"The same day that the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, Baldoni, the studios, and producers were eager to resume production. Instead, they were met with an email from Lively\u2019s lawyer, who sent Wayfarer an unsettling and unexpected 17-point list of non-negotiable conditions that must be met before Lively would return to work,\" the complaint states.",
      "\"The stunning list was drafted for the apparent purpose of insinuating or outright claiming that Baldoni, Heath, and others had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct during filming,\" the complaint continues.",
      "In Lively\u2019s complaint, she also includes details on the meeting, saying it was to discuss \u201cthe inappropriate conduct that Ms. Lively, her employees and other cast and crew experienced at the hands of Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.\u201d Her complaint included the list\u00a0she says was reviewed at the meeting.",
      "In the list, Lively suggested that there wasn't an intimacy coordinator on set, but attorneys for Baldoni write that there was one assigned to the film.",
      "The complaint alleges that Lively didn't meet with the intimacy coordinator, leading Baldoni to work on scenes with the coordinator and relay any changes to Lively.",
      "Baldoni accuses Lively of unchoreographed kissing during scenes, while one of the 17 points on Lively's list was \"no spontaneous improvisation\" during intimate scenes.",
      "Before returning to production, Lively allegedly had more notes and script changes that Baldoni eventually mostly agreed to, out of fear the film would be taken from him by \"threats and coercion,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write that the document was \u201cessentially signed under duress,\u201d and in an email to his team, Baldoni wrote that he was \u201cwaiving the white flag and submitting\u201d and that he would give Lively \u201c98% of what she wants.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively refused to promote the film if she didn\u2019t get her own cuts, replaced film editors with her own",
      "In April and May 2024, Lively was granted her own cut of the film after Sony told Wayfarer that Lively would refuse to promote the film unless her demands were met, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cUltimately, Lively replaced the Film\u2019s editors with her own choice: an editor often used by Reynolds, and the Film\u2019s editors had to be let go,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "As there were two versions of the film, Lively's cut and Baldoni's cut, the studio agreed to do an official audience test of both versions, according to the complaint. Baldoni's version \"scored significantly higher with key audience demographics,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively then said Hoover would not promote the film unless her version was released, and Sony later told Wayfarer that neither Lively nor any of the film's cast would promote the film unless her cut was used.",
      "As noted previously, Lively specified in her response to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit that \u201cSony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",
      "\"Baldoni was forced to choose between killing the film and his own career by insisting on his own creative vision and rights, or putting out a version of the Film that Baldoni knew could still be so important to domestic violence survivors, even if it differed greatly from what it could have been,\" the complaint states. \"Baldoni reluctantly chose the latter, and stood down, allowing Lively\u2019s version of the Film to be released and promoted.\"",
      "The film went on to bring in over $148 million at the box office throughout its theatrical run.",
      "Baldoni alleges he was kept apart from Lively at the film's premiere",
      "The lawsuit contends that Lively communicated that she would not promote the movie if she was not given a producer credit.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege they sent a letter to the Producers Guild of America \"under duress\" asking for Lively to be given a \"coveted\" p.g.a. designation on her producer's credit even though they didn't believe she deserved it.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write in the lawsuit that he was in Sweden for his wife's birthday when he was informed that Lively and a \"majority of the cast\" would boycott the \"It Ends with Us\" premiere if Baldoni attended it.",
      "A compromise was reached in which \"Wayfarer persuaded Lively to 'permit' Baldoni and the Wayfarer team, along with their friends and family, to attend\" the premiere, according to court documents. Baldoni and his family and friends then attended under \"demeaning and humiliating conditions,\" per the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Baldoni had to cut his time on the red carpet short at the event and was \"instructed to stop immediately\" because Lively was on her way.",
      "The court documents include photos of Baldoni with friends and family on folding chairs and surrounded by pallets of soda bottles. Baldoni's attorneys say the photos are from the basement of the venue, where Baldoni and his entourage were allegedly moved to be separate from the remainder of the cast at the premiere.",
      "The group was then escorted out of the building by security to \"avoid even a chance of interaction with Lively or her guests,\" his complaint says.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege that they had to organize and pay for a separate after-party for \"himself and the Wayfarer team\" because he was excluded from the official after-party attended by Lively and the cast. He alleges Wayfarer paid for both parties.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys also allege that he was not invited to any events involving cast members, such as photo shoots, screenings and promotional events, according to court documents.",
      "Baldoni alleges the cast was 'induced' by Lively to shun him, unfollow him on social media",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Lively \"induced\" other cast members to avoid Baldoni \"in an early attempt to give fans the impression that Baldoni had committed an egregious sin, something so egregious that no one wanted to even take photos with him or have him around.\u201d Lively\u2019s response to his lawsuit says that \u201ccast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer.\u201d",
      "His attorneys also write that Lively told Sony that she and the cast would not take part in any promotion of the film with Baldoni present, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges she ordered him to be removed from all artwork promoting the film, including the posters.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys allege that Lively used tactics like unfollowing him on social media as \"crumbs,\" to give fans \"just enough to allow them to come to their own conclusions\" about him, according to court documents.",
      "The court documents include alleged screenshots of a friendly and complimentary text message exchange between Baldoni and actor Isabela Ferrer, who plays a younger version of Lively's character in the movie. The lawsuit asserts that Lively then turned Ferrer against him.",
      "\u201cIt was not until Ferrer spent substantial time with Lively during film promotions that Ferrer felt compelled to shun Baldoni in repudiation of her warm words,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "Ryan Reynolds allegedly told an executive at Baldoni's agency to 'drop' him",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer allege in the lawsuit that Reynolds told an executive at William Morris Endeavor to get rid of Baldoni as a client.",

      "Reynolds allegedly approached a WME executive and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a 'sexual predator'\" and, at a later date, \"demanded that the agent 'drop' Baldoni,\" court documents say.",

      "The\u00a0New York Times story\u00a0published on Dec. 21 includes text messages and emails between public relations experts working for Baldoni that allegedly suggest Lively was the target of a smear campaign. Baldoni's attorneys contend it was the opposite \u2014 Lively started a push to smear him.",

      "In Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively, he alleges that she and her team worked in \"close coordination\" with The New York Times, \"likely over a matter of months.\" He alleges that she provided the newspaper with a copy of her sexual harassment complaint \"long before filing it.\"",

      "Her reaction to the negative press was to shift blame to Baldoni, his attorneys allege in the lawsuit.",

Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\"",
      "What will happen in 'Onyx Storm'?",
      "It's unclear where \"Onyx Storm\" will pick up after the events of \"Iron Flame.\"",
      "Yarros teased what the book will hold in an interview with Elle, revealing that \"fans can expect to see Violet with one singular motivation, which is to save Xaden.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to follow the implications of what\u2019s been revealed in\u00a0'Iron Flame,' and you\u2019re going to see Andarna very curious about where she comes from,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s the biggest thing I can tease before a publisher jumps out and tackles me to the floor.\"",
      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",
      "They need an army. They need power. They need\u00a0magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find\u2014the truth.",
      "But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath."

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker had the kind of career stat line that would be sad if it wasn\u2019t so funny. But funny is what would ultimately cement his legacy.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90, was a career .200 hitter across six seasons in Major League Baseball. He ultimately embraced his own ineptitude, often mocking himself for his lack of ability on the diamond.",
      "Uecker took his schtick and ran with it, all the way to Hollywood. Nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball,\u201d he was a frequent, gut-busting guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d for years after he retired. He appeared in several well-known Miller Lite commercials, in which he poked fun at himself when he declared, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d after an usher at a game informs him that he\u2019s in the wrong seats. He parlayed those efforts into a starring role on the small screen, playing George Owens on the ABC sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere,\u201d which ran for six seasons from 1985 until 1990.",
      "But all of that may have just been a prologue for what seems like a casting job that was as natural as a tailor-made 4-6-3 double play. In the hit 1989 movie \u201cMajor League,\u201d Uecker played Cleveland play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle, whose wit would often serve as cover for how awful the team was, only for him to get caught up in the fervor when the team begins winning.",
      "(There's profanity in the clip below.)",
      "\u201cJuuuust a bit outside,\u201d he casually says early in the movie, stretching out the word \u201cjust\u201d when Charlie Sheen\u2019s Rick \u201cWild Thing\u201d Vaughn throws a pitch more than a few feet off home plate during the team\u2019s first game.

      "\u201cUecker\u2019s irreverence enlivened a character \u2014 the play-by-play announcer \u2014 that had long been taken for granted in baseball films,\u201d Noah Gittell wrote in the 2024 book \u201cBaseball: The Movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, their role was to set the scene for the film\u2019s climactic game with flowery prose or ... act as foil to the players or manager. (Director and writer David S.) Ward and Uecker collaborated on a true innovation of the genre by turning this archetype into a comic Greek chorus punctuating the clownish action on the field with perfectly delivered zingers. It was a breath of fresh air for the baseball film, which had perhaps become overly solemn in the \u201880s with \u2018The Natural,\u2019 \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018Eight Men Out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Uecker, who spent 54 seasons as the radio play-by-play man for the Milwaukee Brewers, reprised the role in \u201cMajor League II.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just a perfect fit as Harry Doyle, though. He also provided a template for those who came after him.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a play-by-play announcer in the game who hasn\u2019t once paid homage to the film by impersonating Uecker\u2019s delivery of that line,\u201d Gittell added about how Uecker said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t only announcers, either. If you ever played Wiffle ball in your backyard, turned on a baseball game or, heck, even tried archery and missed a target by 10 feet, you\u2019ve probably said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",

      "Season 3 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d has finally arrived after months of anticipation, and it's exceeding expectations. The first four episodes have delivered plenty of twists and jaw-dropping moments as several cast members\u2019 dreams of winning the $250,000 ended quickly.",
      "The latest season premiered on Peacock Jan. 9 and introduced fans to the initial 21 cast members tasked with adding as much money to the prize pot while avoiding being banished or murdered by their fellow contestants.",
      "Among the cast, which TODAY exclusively announced in June, were \u201cBig Brother\u201d legends Danielle Reyes and Britney Haynes, deceptive \u201cSurvivor\u201d winners Tony Vlachos and Jeremy Collins and reality television favorites Chrishell Stause and Gabby Windey.",
      "After host Alan Cumming made his grand entrance on horseback and welcomed the cast to the show\u2019s Scottish castle, the game immediately began.",
      "\u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob \"Boston Rob\" Mariano, who was previously revealed as a cast member, was unveiled as a masked member of Cumming\u2019s entourage. The rest of the contestants then had to choose if they wanted Rob to be exiled or join them and oust someone else.",
      "They opted to not accept him. Their consequence: Mariano and \"The Challenge\" vet Wes Bergmann and \"Big Brother\" Season 16 winner Derrick Levasseur later joined the game. The decision was the first of many ruthless choices made in Episodes 1 through 4 by both Faithfuls and Traitors.",
      "By the end of Episode 4, one contestant spent their final night in a coffin and another was betrayed by their closest allies. A teaser for Episode 5 shows the fallout after one of the show's most deceitful and astonishing moves yet.",
      "So, who has been eliminated from Season 3 of \"The Traitors\" so far? Find out below. Then, check back every week as the episodes are released at 9 p.m. ET/ 6 p.m. PT each Thursday to see who else was booted from the show \u2014 and if they were a Faithful or Traitor.",
      "\u2018The Traitors\u2019 Season 3 eliminated contestants",
      "Dorinda Medley",
      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",
      "Wells Adams",
      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

      "Chanel Ayan seemed, admittedly, unprepared for the duplicity she would face on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d Like Dorinda, she erroneously chose to get off the boat in Episode 1. Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor."

      "At a news conference this month, President-elect Donald Trump bragged, \u201cWe defeated ISIS.\u201d",
      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "Tice's media conference came a day after she met with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of Syria's new government and the rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad last month. She expressed that the new authorities can help uncover more information about Austin.",
      "\u201cDuring my time in Damascus, I have been privileged to meet with the new leadership of Syria. It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined to bring home my son,\u201d she said on Monday.",

      "While Tice's visit coincided with the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, about whom she had warm words, she has expressed contrasting opinions on the outgoing Biden administration in recent months for not negotiating hard enough for her son\u2019s release.",
      "Tice, who returns to the U.S. Tuesday, said she would \u201cwait and pray and let the dust settle from all these page turns\u201d for now."

    "summary": "A number of leaders are skipping this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s that time of year when the great and the good gather for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "A slew of heads of state, politicians and business moguls are set to attend the four-day event in the Alpine resort \u2014 but what might be more telling is which leaders are sidestepping the forum.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "Chinese investment in the U.S. isn\u2019t likely to pick up under TrumpA weakening yuan is testing Beijing\u2019s resolve as Trump\u2019s return fuels tariff worriesChina keeps lending rates unchanged as it contends with a weakening yuan",

      "A weakening yuan is testing Beijing\u2019s resolve as Trump\u2019s return fuels tariff worries",
      "China keeps lending rates unchanged as it contends with a weakening yuan",
      "While Donald Trump, who is being inaugurated as U.S. president on Monday, is expected to address the forum via live video link on Thursday, a number of key leaders will be completely absent from the event.",
      "These include Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations \u2014 which includes the U.S., Europe\u2019s biggest economies, Canada and Japan \u2014 the only head of state attending the summit in person is outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "WEF says this year\u2019s event \u2014 the 55th annual forum, which runs from Monday to Thursday \u2014 will convene close to 3,000 leaders from over 130 countries, with the gathering \u201cdemonstrating the critical need for dialogue in an increasingly uncertain era.\u201d It notes that 350 government leaders, including 60 heads of state and governments, \u201cwill gather in Davos-Klosters to address pressing challenges and shape emerging opportunities.\u201d",
      "The theme of the event is \u201cCollaboration for the Intelligent Age,\u201d with the agenda focusing on five key areas: reimagining growth, industries in the intelligent age, investing in people, safeguarding the planet and rebuilding trust.",
      "Not all world leaders will be there to discuss these issues, however.",
      "\u201cThe leaders of Brazil, of China, of India, who gave the keynote speeches 10 years ago, are not there now. Russia has not been welcomed for some years now, Keir Starmer is not going to be there. Macron\u2019s not going to be there,\u201d Jan\u00a0Aart\u00a0Scholte, professor of global transformations and governance challenges at Leiden University, told CNBC Thursday.",
      "\u201cTrue, the prime minister of Spain is going to be there and there are a couple of others, but the general picture of the heads of state, of government that are there is that it\u2019s not the big players. I think if you went through a list of the G20, it\u2019s going to be a small minority [who are attending],\u201d he said.",
      "Collective effort",
      "There is often no official reason given for a lack of participation in WEF, but pressing domestic problems \u2014 ranging from slowing economic growth to political crises \u2014 are known to keep heads of government at home.",
      "In recent years, there has also been some ambivalence over attending an event that has been accused of being elite and out-of-touch.",
      "The forum has repeatedly stated that it provides a space where stakeholders from across business, government, academia, civil society, media and the arts can \u201cmeet on a global, impartial, not-for-profit platform.\u201d",
      "These people, it says, \u201ccome together to find common ground and seize opportunities for positive change on large global issues.\u201d",
      "In a statement to CNBC on Monday, WEF said that\u00a0while it always values the presence of key global leaders,\u00a0\u201cthe Annual Meeting\u2019s impact and ability to drive meaningful dialogue, and action is defined by the collective efforts of a broad and representative community.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s program, the forum continued, \u201cis designed to address the most pressing global challenges, including economic fragmentation, technological transformation, and climate action.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe recognize that global leaders face a wide range of commitments and responsibilities, and their absence does not diminish our ongoing engagement with their respective governments and institutions throughout the year,\u201d\u00a0WEF\u00a0added.",
      "Who will be there",
      "A number of big names will still join this year\u2019s summit \u2014 an event that began  in 1971 under the aegis of Klaus Schwab, who remained executive chairman of the event until the start of this year.",
      "Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are all due to make speeches in Davos this week.",
      "The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will likewise attend, as will the leaders of global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization.",
      "Sven Smit, a senior partner at strategic WEF partner\u00a0McKinsey\u00a0& Company, said in online comments that it would be a priority for participants to \u201cunderstand what is on the mind of the leaders who are at Davos.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully predict it, there are themes out there that people suggest, they range from growth to sustainability, but what distils as a Davos theme is not fully predictable and that\u2019s the interesting part,\u201d Smit said.",
      "However, many of the Western institutions in attendance have, in recent years, found themselves on the wrong side of a push against globalization by populist leaders like Trump, and countries like Russia and China.",
      "WEF, too, has fallen foul of this anti-establishment trend, Scholte noted, and while the presence of leaders like Trump might not have been sought out in the past, there is now an acceptance that the world has changed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that the promoters of a liberal, open world economy speak with quite as much disdain, let\u2019s say, of contrary forces and views as they might have done, say, before the global financial crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bit more modesty that, no, it sometimes doesn\u2019t fully work. And no, we haven\u2019t always taken sufficient account of those who feel excluded from this.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he stressed that WEF was still a draw for many business and political leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are various indicators that a site like the World Economic Forum isn\u2019t as strong a magnet as it might have been a couple of decades ago,\u201d Scholte said. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s no longer a magnet, and the idea that it also doesn\u2019t have certain areas within world economic governance where it can still be very strong, I think that would be wrong.\u201d"

      "Authorities said security was being beefed up at the Seoul Detention Center where\u00a0Yoon\u00a0is being held as a pre-trial inmate and at the Constitutional Court, which is holding an impeachment trial to decide whether to permanently remove him from office.",
      "Yoon\u00a0became the first incumbent South\u00a0Korean president to be arrested last week over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3.",
      "On Sunday, he was formally\u00a0processed for detention, including having his mugshot taken, after a court approved a warrant, citing concern the suspect could destroy evidence.",
      "Following the midnight ruling, angry\u00a0Yoon\u00a0supporters stormed the Seoul Western District Court building early on Sunday, destroying property and clashing with police officers who were at times overpowered by a mob wielding broken barricades to attack them.",
      "Police are planning to arrest 66 people for trespass, obstruction of official duty and assaulting police officers, Yonhap News Agency reported.",
      "Other offenders were still being identified and the police will also take legal action against them, acting Justice Minister Kim Seok-woo told a parliament judiciary committee.",
      "Acting President Choi Sang-mok expressed deep regret over the \u201cillegal violence\u201d at the court building and also urged police to enforce the law strictly to prevent a repeat of what happened on Sunday.",
      "Hundreds of protesters, some blasting fire extinguishers at lines of police officers, broke through a cordon to enter the court building soon after the 3 a.m. ruling on Sunday to approve the detention of\u00a0Yoon.",
      "Some of them were seen in video footage roaming halls where the offices of judges were located, calling out the name of the judge who approved the warrant.",
      "At least one judge\u2019s chamber was broken into by force, said Chun Dae-yup, the head of the National Court Administration.",
      "Several of those involved livestreamed the intrusion on YouTube, with footage showing protesters trashing the court and chanting\u00a0Yoon\u2019s name. Some streamers were caught by police during their broadcasts.",
      "Yoon\u2019s refusal to appear for questioning on Monday at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the criminal investigation, comes after he has repeatedly refused to cooperate with the inquiry.",
      "His lawyers have argued that his arrest on Wednesday and the warrant issued for his detention are illegal because they were backed by a court that is in the wrong jurisdiction and the CIO itself has no legal authority to conduct the investigation.",
      "Insurrection, the crime that\u00a0Yoon\u00a0may be charged with, is one of the few that a South\u00a0Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death. South\u00a0Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.",
      "Yoon\u00a0said through his lawyers that he found Sunday\u2019s rampage at the court \u201cshocking and unfortunate,\u201d calling on people to express their opinions peacefully. In the statement,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0also said he understood many were feeling \u201crage and unfairness,\u201d asking the police to take a tolerant position."

      "Also in November, 21-year-old Xu Jiajin killed eight people and injured 17 others in a stabbing attack at his vocational school in the eastern city of Wuxi. Police said Wu had failed his examinations and could not graduate, and was dissatisfied about his pay at an internship. He was also executed on Monday, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV.",

      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",
      "He has known Trump for decades, is a Republican donor and served on one of Trump\u2019s Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",

      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was formally arrested early on Sunday, days after being apprehended at his presidential compound in Seoul.",
      "Yoon\u2019s arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody, lasting months or more. He faces possible imprisonment over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month.",
      "The decision to arrest Yoon triggered unrest at the Seoul Western District Court, where dozens of his supporters broke in and rioted, destroying the main door and windows. They used plastic chairs, metal beams and police shields that they managed to wrestle away from officers. Some were seen throwing objects and using fire extinguishers, destroying furniture and glass doors. They shouted demands to see the judge who had issued the warrant, but she had already left.",
      "Hundreds of police officers were deployed and nearly 90 protesters were arrested. Some injured police officers were seen being treated at ambulance vans. The court said it was trying to confirm whether any staff members were injured and assess the damage to its facilities.",
      "A court deliberated for 8 hours",
      "Following eight hours of deliberation, the court granted law enforcement\u2019s request for an arrest warrant for Yoon, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court and argued for his release.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country\u2019s most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "While South Korean presidents have wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, can now extend Yoon\u2019s detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court\u2019s arrest warrant.",
      "Yoon\u2019s appearance in court triggered chaotic scenes in nearby streets, where thousands of his fervent supporters rallied for hours calling for his release. Even before the court issued the warrant for Yoon\u2019s arrest, protesters repeatedly clashed with police who detained dozens of them, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing Saturday. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyer decries his arrest",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "His political fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which is deliberating whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, called the court\u2019s decision to issue the warrant \u201cthe epitome of anti-constitutionalism and anti-rule of law,\u201d maintaining Yoon\u2019s claim that his martial law decree was a legitimate act of governance. He pointed to the chaos at the Seoul Western Court and said Yoon\u2019s arrest would inspire more anger from his supporters.",
      "Yoon\u2019s People Power Party regretted his arrest but also pleaded for his supporters to refrain from further violence.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative effort to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14, said his arrest would be a \u201ccornerstone for restoring the collapsed constitutional order.\u201d Kim Sung-hoi, a party lawmaker and spokesperson, called for stern punishment of Yoon\u2019s supporters who stormed the court.",
      "\u201cI urge police to firmly enforce the law so that forces supporting rebellion will never even think of causing turmoil again,\u201d he said.",
      "The country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, expressed \u201cstrong regret\u201d about the violence at the court, saying it \u201cdirectly undermines democracy and the rule of law.\u201d He asked for heightened security at the sites related to Yoon\u2019s case and measures to ensure order during protests.",
      "Yoon was transported to the court from a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul, in a blue Justice Ministry van escorted by police and the presidential security service, to attend the hearing at the court ahead of its warrant decision.",
      "The motorcade entered the court\u2019s basement parking space as thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters gathered in nearby streets amid a heavy police presence. Following the hearing, Yoon was transported back to the detention center, where he awaited the decision. He did not speak to reporters.",
      "After its investigators were attacked by protesters later on Saturday, the anti-corruption agency asked media companies to obscure the faces of its members attending the hearing.",
      "Yoon insists his martial law decree was legitimate",
      "Yoon and his lawyers have claimed that the martial law declaration was intended as a temporary and \u201cpeaceful\u201d warning to the liberal opposition, which he accuses of obstructing his agenda with its legislative majority. Yoon says the troops sent to the National Election Commission offices were to investigate election fraud allegations, which remains unsubstantiated in South Korea.",
      "Yoon has stressed he had no intention of stopping the functioning of the legislature. He stated that the troops were sent there to maintain order, not prevent lawmakers from entering and voting to lift martial law. He denied allegations that he ordered the arrests of key politicians and election officials.",
      "Military commanders, however, have described a deliberate attempt to seize the legislature that was thwarted by hundreds of civilians and legislative staff who helped lawmakers enter the assembly, and by the troops\u2019 reluctance or refusal to follow Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",
      "If the first court convicts him and issues a prison term, Yoon would serve that sentence as the case possibly moves up to the Seoul High Court and Supreme Court. Under South Korean law, orchestrating a rebellion is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty."

    "summary": "A man fatally shot two prominent hard-line judges in Iran\u2019s capital Saturday, officials said, both of whom allegedly took part in the mass execution of dissidents in 1988.",
    "story": [
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 A man fatally shot two prominent hard-line judges in Iran\u2019s capital Saturday, officials said, both of whom allegedly took part in the\u00a0mass execution of dissidents\u00a0in 1988.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shootings of the judges, clerics Mohammad Mogheiseh and Ali Razini. However, Razini\u2019s involvement in the 1988 executions had likely made him a target in the past, including an assassination attempt in 1999.",
      "Their killings, a rare attack targeting the judiciary, also come as Iran faces economic turmoil,\u00a0the mauling of its Mideast allies\u00a0by Israel and the return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday.",
      "Both clerics served on Iran\u2019s Supreme Court, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. A bodyguard for one of the judges also was wounded in the attack at the Palace of Justice in Tehran, which also serves as the headquarters of the country\u2019s judiciary and typically has tight security.",
      "The attacker, who was armed with a handgun, killed himself, IRNA said.",
      "\u201cAccording to initial investigations, the person in question did not have a case in the Supreme Court nor was he a client of the branches of the court,\u201d the judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency said. \u201cCurrently, investigations have been launched to identify and arrest the perpetrators of this terrorist act.\u201d",
      "Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s judiciary, separately told Iranian state television that the shooter had been an \u201cinfiltrator,\u201d suggesting he had worked at the courthouse where the killings took place.",
      "Unlike the U.S. Supreme Court, the Iranian Supreme Court has many branches spread across the country. It is the highest court in Iran and can hear appeals on decisions made by lower courts.",
      "Razini had been targeted previously. In January 1999, attackers on motorcycles hurled an explosive at his vehicle, wounding him as he left work as the head of the judiciary in Tehran.",
      "Mogheiseh had been under sanctions from the U.S. Treasury since 2019. At the time, the Treasury described him as having \u201coverseen countless unfair trials, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is notorious for sentencing scores of journalists and internet users to lengthy prison terms,\u201d the Treasury said. Mogheiseh had pressed charges against members of Iran\u2019s Baha\u2019i minority \u201cafter they reportedly held prayer and worship ceremonies with other members,\u201d the Treasury said.",
      "Both men had been named by activists and exiles as taking part in the 1988 executions, which came at the end of Iran\u2019s long war with Iraq. After Iran\u2019s then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini accepted a U.N.-brokered ceasefire, members of the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, heavily armed by Saddam Hussein, stormed across the Iranian border in a surprise attack.",
      "Iran ultimately blunted their assault, but the attack set the stage for the sham retrials of political prisoners, militants and others that would become known as \u201cdeath commissions.\u201d",
      "International rights groups estimate that as many as 5,000 people were executed, while the MEK puts the number at 30,000. Iran has never fully acknowledged the executions, apparently carried out on Khomeini\u2019s orders, though some argue that other top officials were effectively in charge in the months before his 1989 death.",
      "The MEK declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press.",
      "While Mogheiseh never addressed the accusation he took part in the 1988 \u201cdeath commissions,\u201d Razini gave a 2017 interview published by Iran\u2019s Shargh newspaper in which he defended the panels as \u201cfair and completely in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur friends and I who are among the 20 judges in the country, we did our best to ensure the security of that time and the years after and from then, we guaranteed that the hypocrites (the MEK) could never become powerful in this country,\u201d he reportedly said."

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas has been reached after 15 months of devastating war that has seen tens of thousands of people killed in the Gaza Strip, left scores of Israeli hostages in painful limbo and changed the face of the Middle East.",
      "The truce, initially announced Wednesday, is expected to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 46,500 people and caused a devastating humanitarian crisis, according to local health officials. It will also see the phased release of dozens of hostages captured during the Oct. 7 2023, terror attack who are still being held in Gaza, as well as the release of hundreds of Palestinians detained by Israel.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump didn\u2019t hide his disdain for the State Department in his first term, dismissing it as the \"Deep State Department,\" a nickname that implied a cabal of career diplomats were subverting his foreign policy goals.",

      "The arrangement jibes with Trump\u2019s larger goal of stocking important government jobs with people he deems loyal to his agenda.",
      "But the fast-growing latticework of special envoys, ambassadors and foreign policy professionals creates the potential for duplication that may confuse foreign capitals about who\u2019s really running things, critics contend.",

      "There's Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state and onetime political rival; Warren Stephens, the billionaire investment banker nominated to be the ambassador; and Mark Burnett, the incoming special envoy who produced \"The Apprentice,\" the television show that amped up Trump\u2019s celebrity.",
      "\"I'm mystified by the notion that you would have an ambassador to the United Kingdom and a special envoy to the United Kingdom.

      "As Trump described it, their mission is to bring movies to foreign countries and thus improve Hollywood\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Not all of the envoys have Trump\u2019s confidence. He named Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as a deputy to Witkoff, but he wrote in the announcement that he was doing so to appease fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cEarly on, Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating. (Ortagus said on Fox News in 2016 that she disagreed with Trump\u2019s \u201cisolationist approach to foreign policy.\u201d)",
      "Many presidents have seen value in bringing in special envoys to tackle thorny problems abroad. It\u2019s a way of reassuring Americans that the White House is focusing attention on particular trouble spots.",

      "\u201cA special envoy can pull away responsibility from the bureaus and senior [foreign service officers], with the predictable effect on morale and the [State Department\u2019s] ability to function effectively,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition, the secretary does not have the capacity to supervise them all.\u201d",
      "That report came out 11 years ago. A spokesman for the association said that \u201cour position has not changed\u201d since then."
