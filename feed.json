    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "Country singer Parker McCollum will release his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",
      "He thought, \u201cThat song is going to be cut at some point or another in my career. Might as well make it now.\u201d",
      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a (expletive) anymore. Whatever it is that I do sound like, you know, that\u2019s what I wanna do.\u201d",
      "As long as the songs \u201cmake you feel something.\u201d",
      "That's something fans have long connected to, since the release of his debut, \u201cThe Limestone Kid,\u201d a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt really eats at me to put out music that hits you where music hits me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really enjoy that chase and that journey of, \u2018Am I going to write songs that are good enough?\u2019 ... I\u2019m trying to find those answers.\u201d",

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, heralding the start of Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle",
      "PARIS -- The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019 Pompidou Center Tuesday, clearing the way for a different kind of flight: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z swept into the front row.",
      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Bad Company's 1975 follow-up, \u201cStraight Shooter,\u201d was also a hit, going to No. 3 on album charts in both the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and the UK Albums Chart.",
      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",
      "The band's statement says Ralphs is survived by \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d his wife Susie Chavasse, along with two children, three step-children and \u201cbeloved bandmates\u201d Rodgers and Kirke.",
      "\u201cOur last conversation a few days ago we shared a laugh,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",
      "Nickelodeon is celebrating Dora\u2019s 25th anniversary with the feature-length live-action movie \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d a third season of the rebooted animated series \u201cDora,\u201d the podcast Dora\u2019s Mermaid Adventures, an album of songs and plenty of toys and apparel.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d led to what Herles laughingly calls the \u201cDora-verse\u201d \u2014 the spinoff series \u201cGo, Diego, Go!,\u201d a sequel series \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d and the 2019 live-action feature film \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced, Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",
      "Valdes and Gifford originally had the idea for a show about a little girl who was a problem solver. Like \u201cBlue's Clues,\u201d it would reward kids for figuring out answers posed by the host.",
      "\u201cPreschoolers are the least powerful people in our world,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cThey're not able to button their sweater and not able to tie their shoes, but if they\u2019re able to help Dora get to the City of Lost Toys and really feel like they helped, that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy tackles some serious topics like how to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma",
      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "Pomodoro died at home in Milan on Sunday, the eve of his 99th birthday, according to a statement from Carlotta Montebello, director general of the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation.",
      "Pomodoro\u2019s massive spheres are instantly recognizable: shiny, smooth bronze globes with clawed out interiors that Pomodoro has said referred to the superficial perfection of exteriors and the troubled complexity of interiors.",

      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",
      "After its strong start last weekend with $12 million, A24\u2019s \u201cMaterialists\u201d held well with $5.8 million in its second weekend. The romantic drama by writer-director Celine Song and starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans has collected $24 million so far.",
      "Next weekend should also be a competitive one in movie theaters, with both \u201cF1,\u201d from Apple and Warner Bros., and Universal\u2019s \u201cMegan 2.0\u201d launching in cinemas.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "A judge has denied singer R. Kelly\u2019s request for furlough from prison after the convicted sex offender accused federal prison officials of plotting to murder him",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",
      "Pacold noted that Kelly offers no evidence to back up his claims. Government lawyers suggested Kelly had spun a \u201cfanciful conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence.

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "CDC nominee Susan Monarez says she values vaccines and rigorous scientific evidence but has largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F",
      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",
      "Monarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy's decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of medical liability lawsuits by injured athletes who claim a poor outcome caused them to lose future earnings",
      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "A West Virginia woman has filed a lawsuit seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",

      "An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America in a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit heat that hasn\u2019t been seen in some places in more than a decade",
      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",
      "\u201cIt will be a shock to the system,\u201d she said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",

      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "The top U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong has criticized policies by China and Hong Kong for eroding freedoms",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's top American diplomat said on Thursday that the policies of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have curtailed freedoms, pointing to the cases of jailed prominent activist Jimmy Lai and what he called \u201ctransnational regression.\"",
      "At a reception for the U.S. Independence Day, U.S. Consul General Gregory May, who will join the U.S. Embassy in Beijing next month after a three-year term in Hong Kong, told reporters he is a \u201cbig fan\u201c of Hong Kong, and that its people and spirit made the city a good place.",
      "\u201cHong Kong is a great city. What is not great is the policies of the mainland Chinese government, the Hong Kong government, that have eroded freedom,\u201d he said.",
      "Following the 2019 anti-government movement that filled Hong Kong\u2019s streets with protesters, Beijing imposed a national security law that it deemed necessary for the city's stability. Under the law, Lai and many other leading activists were prosecuted.",
      "May said U.S. President Donald Trump was very concerned about the fate of Lai, who is fighting national security charges that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Before he was elected Trump said he would \u201c100%\u201d get Lai out of jail.",
      "May said Washington is also concerned about others, jailed for the peaceful expression of political views.",
      "\u201cThe other friction point in my term here has been transnational repression, and it's very disappointing to see over my three years here, attempts by Hong Kong authorities to enforce the national security law within the borders of the United States against U.S. persons,\u201d he said.",
      "He was referring to accusations by Hong Kong authorities against some overseas-based activists claiming they violated the security law and offering rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,000) for information leading to each of their arrests.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. Consulate condemned the Hong Kong government for what it called repression of 4th of July celebrations after city education authorities reportedly cautioned teachers and students not to attend events marking the day and organized by American diplomats.",
      "May said he was disappointed over the move and that it was \u201cpretty perplexing.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, the city\u2019s education bureau responded to media queries, saying schools have the responsibility to be good gatekeepers and to enhance the sensitivity of teachers and students to national security at that time.",

      "Online maps show that Miyun No. 1 Elementary School is just north of the intersection. Miyun is about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of central Beijing.",

      "Cambodia\u2019s powerful former leader Hun Sen and Thailand\u2019s prime minister have made separate visits to border areas",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia's powerful former leader Hun Sen and Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, on Thursday made separate visits to border areas as the two countries remain locked in an ongoing dispute that has resulted in strict land crossing restrictions and several economic boycotts.",
      "Hun Sun and Paetongtarn didn't meet. Relations between the neighboring nations have deteriorated following an armed confrontation on May 28 in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in contested territory along their border.",
      "While the two sides have agreed to de-escalate their dispute, they have continued to implement or threaten measures that have kept tensions high.",
      "Hun Sen posted on his social media after the visit that more troops and weapons have been mobilized to several border areas between Cambodia and Thailand after the clash. He said that soldiers \u201care constantly prepared to defend the territory in case of any invasion by the Thai army.\u201d",
      "He did not elaborate on when exactly the reinforcement happened, or how many soldiers and what kinds of weapons were deployed. But days after the dispute erupted, several videos of tanks and armed forces were filmed and posted on social media as they moved past Phnom Penh.",
      "Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for nearly four decades, was seen wearing a military uniform, shaking hands with military commanders and government officials who waited to greet him as he got off a military helicopter. It was the first time that he paid a visit to the border since the latest conflict was triggered. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet visited the troops and civilians at the border on Monday.",
      "Hun Sen remains powerful although he stepped down as Cambodia's prime minister in August 2023 and handed over power to Hun Manet, his oldest son. Hun Sen continues to hold several major positions in the country, including Senate president.",
      "Thai regional army commander Boonsin Padklang, who's in charge of the area where the clash happened, told reporters earlier this week that he was aware of Cambodia's reinforcements along the border, and that the Thai forces were also ready to secure the border situation if necessary. He didn't say whether Thailand had also deployed more troops and weapons to the border.",
      "The Thai army this week imposed heightened restrictions at border checkpoints with Cambodia following an order from Paetongtarn to allow only students, medical patients and others with essential needs to enter or leave Thailand. That also makes it impossible for thousands of tourists to cross between the two countries.",
      "Paetongtarn on Thursday made a visit to the border town of Aranyaprathet, a major trade hub between Thailand and Cambodia that has felt much of the impact from retaliatory measures from both sides. She met with troops and local authorities, and visited a school to discuss the effects of the new restrictions",
      "Cambodia's government has accused Thailand of escalating tensions with new land crossing restrictions. Cambodia has boycotted some Thai internet services, banned Thai fruits and vegetables, and blocked electricity and fuel supplies from Thailand in response to the border dispute. Prior to the boycott, Cambodia imported 30% of its gasoline and other fuel from Thailand.",
      "Last week, a leaked phone call between Paetongtarn and Hun Sen set off political turmoil in Thailand, shattering Paetongtarn's already fragile coalition government and triggering a string of investigations that could lead to her removal.",
      "There is a long history of territorial disputes between the two countries. Thailand is still rattled by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011. The ruling from the U.N. court was reaffirmed in 2013.",
      "Cambodia said that it's seeking a ruling for several border dispute areas again from the ICJ. Thailand has said that it doesn\u2019t accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ and called for Cambodia to resolve the conflict through existing bilateral mechanisms.",
      "Officials from the two countries have scheduled a joint committee meeting for September to resolve the border tensions. Both sides met earlier this month, but failed to achieve any major breakthrough.",

      "The destroyed drugs included opium, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, ketamine and the stimulant known as ice, or crystal meth, Yangon Police Brig. Gen. Sein Lwin said in a speech at a drug-burning ceremony.",
      "The drug burnings came nearly a month after U.N. experts warned of unprecedented levels of methamphetamine production and trafficking from Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle region, where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet, and Myanmar\u2019s eastern Shan State in particular.",
      "The production of opium and heroin historically flourished there, largely because of the lawlessness in border areas where Myanmar\u2019s central government has been able to exercise only minimum control over various ethnic minority militias, some of them partners in the drug trade.",
      "The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in a May report that the political crisis across the country after the military takeover in 2021 \u2014 which led to a civil war \u2014 has turbocharged growth of the methamphetamine trade.",
      "In the country\u2019s biggest city, Yangon, a massive pile of drugs worth more than $117 million went up in a blaze, Sein Lwin said.",
      "Similar events to mark the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking also occurred in the country\u2019s second-largest city of Mandalay, and in Taunggyi, the capital of eastern Myanmar\u2019s Shan state, all areas close to where the drugs are produced.",
      "A police official from the capital Naypyitaw told The Associated Press that the substances burned in three locations were worth $297.95 million. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not yet been publicly announced.",
      "Myanmar has a long history of drug production linked to political and economic insecurity caused by decades of armed conflict. It has been a major source of illegal drugs destined for East and Southeast Asia, despite repeated efforts to crack down.",
      "That has led the flow of drugs to surge \u201cacross not only East and Southeast Asia, but also increasingly into South Asia, in particular Northeast India,\u201d the UN said last month.

      "Sydney\u2019s harbor becomes a humpback highway in winter as the whales migrate from feeding grounds in Antarctica to breeding areas off Australia\u2019s coast",
      "PORT STEPHENS, Australia -- The ferry was late, but not because of the usual traffic. Sydney commuters watched from an idling boat this month as humpback whales the size of buses surfaced nearby, halting the vessel\u2019s passage across the harbor. The curious mammals seemed to be watching them back.",
      "In June and July, it\u2019s not uncommon for whales to stop water traffic in Sydney. Winter heralds the opening of the so-called humpback highway, a migratory corridor along Australia's east coast used by about 40,000 of the massive creatures as they travel from feeding grounds in freezing Antarctica to tropical breeding areas off Queensland state.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s blubber to blubber,\u201d said Dr. Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney and author of the book \u201cHumpback Highway.\u201d During peak traffic periods the bustling coastal city of 5.5 million people becomes one of the world\u2019s few urban centers where you might see a breaching whale on your morning walk, while buying a coffee, or waiting at a bus stop \u2013 anyplace you can see the ocean.",
      "The reason humpbacks on the highway are so visible is due to their size \u2013 adults can be 16-17 meters (52-56 feet) in length, and weigh 40 tonnes \u2013 and their proximity to people. On their 10,000km (6,000 mile) journey from icy to balmy waters, one of the world\u2019s longest mammal migrations, the creatures stay close to shore.",
      "\u201cThey are incredibly curious,\u201d said Pirotta. \u201cThere\u2019s been times where there\u2019s been whales in the harbor this year where they\u2019ve literally halted traffic.\u201d",
      "Australians get so close to the creatures that some have attracted fans. Among them are Migaloo, an all-white humpback whose sightings spanned 1991 to 2020, and Blade Runner, named for her tussle with a boat propeller that created her long, distinctive scars.",
      "Some keen whale watchers seek a closer look. On a recent morning, Ben Armstrong, a veteran skipper of a whale-watching boat in Port Stephens, a scenic harbor north of Sydney, slowed the engine as two humpbacks breached nearby.",
      "He encouraged passengers to put down their phones and enjoy the spectacle. Armstrong keeps his tourist boat at distances mandated by Australia\u2019s state laws, but inquisitive whales often go off-script.",
      "Once, the skipper let his boat drift for an hour while four or five humpbacks treated the vessel \u201clike a bath toy,\" playfully preventing it from moving forward or back. In another episode, a whale peeled away from its pod and rushed to the boat, \u201clike a dog greeting its master at the gate,\u201d he said.",
      "It lounged for 40 minutes in the water, rubbing its massive fins against the vessel. \u201cIt was like, \u2019Oh, there\u2019s that boat I really like,\u201d said Armstrong.",
      "Vincent Kelly, who travelled from Geelong, Victoria, to witness the migration was a recent passenger. Over two hours, he watched half a dozen humpbacks perform breathtaking aerial maneuvers.",
      "\u201cIt was unbelievable to me,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to actually see a whale. But they were everywhere.\u201d",
      "The humpback gridlock marks a sharp reversal of fortune for the whales. They were once hunted for meat and oil, and numbers dwindled to a few hundred before humpbacks became a protected species in the Southern Hemisphere in 1963.",
      "The humpback boom to about 40,000 since has brought the creatures into more frequent contact with people than before. That means more entanglements with fishing nets or run-ins with watercraft.",
      "Where and when they appear has become less predictable too, with whales in recent years giving birth to calves the size of small cars in unexpected places. Harvesting of krill, which humpbacks eat in bulk, and heating seas due to climate change could be altering their migratory patterns, Pirotta said.",
      "The population is still growing steadily, amplifying concerns about how humans and giants of the sea can safely share the coastline. But it also puts millions of Australians a short walk and a little luck away from encountering one of the largest mammals on the planet.",
      "\u201cIt grounds you, I think,\u201d said Armstrong, the boat skipper. \u201cIt makes you realize there\u2019s a lot more out there than what we think there is in nature.\u201d",

      "Jakarta\u2019s main roads are notorious for nail traps",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Clad in reflective vests and waving traffic control sticks, a spirited crew on a main road in central Jakarta cheerfully waved to people as they cleared hidden hazards with iron bars and circle magnets tied to ropes.",
      "The volunteer team covered half a kilometer (0.3 miles) and scooped up a haul of sharp metal including nails, threaded bolts and scraps of umbrella frames during what they considered a good Saturday morning\u2019s work making the streets of Indonesia's capital safer from \u201cnail traps.\u201d",
      "Jakarta\u2019s main roads are notorious for the patches of sharp metal pieces that are believed to be spread by vandals intent on damaging the tires of cars and motorbikes, usually on main roads where traffic moves fast.",
      "Siswanto, a West Jakarta resident, began collecting metal from the streets in 2010. Inspired by his efforts and fueled by their own bad experiences with the pesky tire traps, more Jakarta road users joined in. The effort soon grew into a community known as the Sapu Bersih, also known as the Clean Sweep or Saber community.",
      "\u201cFrom 2010 to 2016, we collected 4 tons of the nail traps from Jakarta and other areas, like Bekasi. We collected them from the volunteers,\u201d said Siswanto, now 51, who used a rope tied to a magnet to collect sharp pieces as he patrolled a roadside with a fellow volunteer.",
      "After 15 years, the community members are still trying to clean the streets. They take turns before they go to their workplaces in the morning or before returning home in the evening. At least 250 grams (8.8 ounces) of metal pieces are collected every morning from several locations, Siswanto said.",
      "Jakarta Traffic Police Chief Komarudin lauded the efforts of the street sweepers who are trying to reduce the traps.",
      "\u201cIn addition to identifying the purpose and combing the locations, the communities, such as SABER, has also volunteered to clean the roads, which deserves our appreciation,\u201d he said.",
      "When bikers hit the patches of accumulated metal pieces, tires deflate relatively quickly.",
      "\u201cThe nail trap is harmful. It particularly can damage tubeless tires. If it\u2019s a small hole that can still be patched. If it\u2019s a big one, it has to be replaced if not given another inner tube,\u201d said Yoga Fajri Pratama, who does repairs.",
      "Although his shop is not close to some of the usual nail trap locations, Pratama said many bikers come to him to have tires fixed. He explained a trap does not have to be a nail, but could also be a piece of iron with a hole in the middle, like an umbrella frame cut into small pieces.",
      "Many believe the nail traps do not accumulate accidentally. There is a suspicion that troublemakers deliberately spread the tire-shredding hazards, with motorbikes a prime target.",
      "\u201cIt is also sad to hear that someone is spreading them. That means they intentionally damage other people\u2019s tires,\u201d Pratama said.",
      "According to one rumor circulating among Jakarta residents, nail traps could be connected to tire repair shops trying to create more business.",
      "\u201cIt is suspicious after hitting a nail trap, 100 meters from where we hit there was a tire patcher. That is suspicious. But I am not accusing, no,\u201d said Pandu Dewanata, a 29-year-old motorbike taxi driver who has had at least three tire punctures caused by metal fragments in the past year.",
      "Police investigating the traps have found nuts or bolts that could accidentally fall from passing vehicles, but also nails and other objects that are deliberately bent.",
      "Komarudin, the traffic police chief, suspects the sharp debris also is intended to force bikers to the side of a road with a flat and turn them into easy targets for more serious crimes such as robbery.",
      "Dian Anggraeni, 33, a taxi driver from Jakarta, joined the Clean Sweep community in 2018 when she was working as a motorbike driver.",
      "Her experience of having flat tires up to three times a day, or several days in a row, prompted her to seek a way to prevent possible accidents or repair costs caused by nail traps.",
      "Years later, she continues to feel the urge to remove the dangerous objects that keep coming back.",
      "\u201cWhen I finished sweeping nails on the road, I felt that it is enough, I had enough, and can minimize the casualties. Even after I finished it, I can find more in five or 10 minutes later,\u201d Anggraeni said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit annoying too, so I want this to end. It seems like it\u2019s already over, no nail trap, but they are moving locations again. That\u2019s what makes us never finish,\u201d Anggraeni said.",

      "Honduras President Xiomara Castro and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem discuss immigration and border security during their first meeting",
      "TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Honduras President Xiomara Castro and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem discussed immigration and border security in their first meeting Wednesday, after Castro had previously rejected President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for ramped up deportations.",
      "Noem was the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Honduras.",
      "The two leaders did not make comments to the press after their meeting. But Honduras Foreign Affairs Minister Javier B\u00fa Soto later said that Honduras signed a letter of intent toward reaching an agreement on sharing biometric data from people transiting the country with the U.S. government. The U.S. has signed similar agreements with other governments across the region.",
      "The two governments also signed an agreement related to migrants seeking protection in Honduras, he said, though he did not explain what it entailed.",
      "\u201cWe are going to continue mutually collaborating on issues of migration security, border security and the fight against drug trafficking,\u201d B\u00fa Soto said.",
      "Noem was headed next to Guatemala where she was scheduled to meet with President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo on Thursday.",
      "Relations between the U.S. and Castro\u2019s administration had been tense since she ordered the end of the longstanding extradition treaty last year. It was under that treaty that Castro sent her predecessor ex-President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez to the United States to be tried on drug trafficking charges.",
      "The U.S. ambassador at the time had angered Castro by criticizing the visit of Honduran officials to Venezuela to meet with that country\u2019s longtime defense minister, Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by the U.S.",
      "Then in January, Castro raised the possibility of ending Honduras\u2019 cooperation with the U.S. military if Trump followed through on his promised mass deportations.",
      "The main U.S. military presence in Honduras is at Soto Cano Air Base outside the capital. While it is a Honduran base, the U.S. has maintained a significant presence there since 1983 and it has become a key U.S. launching point for humanitarian and anti-drug missions in Central America.",
      "Castro eventually reversed course earlier this year on the extradition treaty and restored the agreement after negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "But Honduras was notably left off U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s trip through the region in February.",
      "Honduran international affairs analyst Graco P\u00e9rez the two governments discussed likely discussed more than they announced.",
      "\u201cThat is the official version, we don\u2019t know the other part,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.",
      "He also questioned comments made by Castro\u2019s son and Presidential Minister Hector Zelaya after the meeting emphasizing the strength of the countries' relationship and coordination.",
      "\u201cFor three and a half years they were confronting (the U.S.) and now, in the last six months, they want to give the impression that relations are very cordial,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that.\u201d",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Noem met with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves in San Jose. They signed a letter reaffirming the U.S. support for Costa Rica\u2019s bid to join the Global Entry program. That is a program run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which allows certain passengers who applied to the program and are prescreened to get expedited entry into the U.S.",
      "Noem also said the U.S. would help Chaves advance toward his goal of scanning all people and goods entering Costa Rica. The U.S. has been signing agreements across the region for governments to collect and share biometric data on people entering their countries.",
      "\u201c(Costa Rica) will give us the most advanced information that we need to know on people who could come into our countries that could do us harm, but also how to prevent them from spreading their criminality and their evil across the world,\u201d Noem said.",
      "Noem visited Panama on Tuesday, where she met with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino. The U.S. government has designated $14 million for a repatriation program where Panama flies migrants back to their countries.",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- A fugitive drug trafficker wanted by authorities in Ecuador and the United States was recaptured more than a year after he escaped from prison in the Andean nation, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced Wednesday.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas, alias \u201cFito,\u201d who led a gang called \u201cLos Choneros\" in Ecuador and has been indicted in New York City on charges he imported thousands of pounds of cocaine into the United States, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials in Ecuador said.",
      "Interpol had issued an arrest warrant for Macias after hi s mysterious prison escape in early 2024 from the Guayaquil Regional Prison, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking. Ecuadorian authorities have yet to explain how he escaped. They only learned of his escape when a military contingent arrived to transfer him to another maximum-security prison but didn't find him in his cell.",
      "The Ecuadorian army confirmed Macias' recapture in what appeared to be the basement of a house. A video provided by the army showed the moment of the arrest, with a uniformed officer aiming a gun at the head of the drug trafficker, who gave his full name. The officers had found him hiding in a small hole beneath what appeared to be a kitchen counter.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement of his arrest comes in the same week that Federico G\u00f3mez, alias \u201cFede,\u201d the leader of another gang called Las Aguilas, was confirmed to have escaped from an Ecuadorian prison.",
      "Last year, U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a news release that Macias led Los Choneros and its \u201cnetwork of assassins and drug and weapon traffickers\u201d since at least 2020.",
      "With an extensive criminal record including charges of murder and organized crime, Mac\u00edas has cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public in his home country.",
      "While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to \u201cthe Ecuadorian people\u201d while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches.",
      "The seven-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Mac\u00edas and an unidentified co-defendant with international cocaine distribution, conspiracy and weapons counts, including smuggling firearms from the United States.",
      "Los Choneros employed people to buy firearms, components and ammunition in the United States and smuggle them into Ecuador, according to the indictment. Cocaine would flow into the United States with the help of Mexican cartels.",
      "\u201cLos Choneros operated a vast network responsible for the shipment and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States and elsewhere,\u201d the indictment says.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Authorities in Ecuador have classified the gang as a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, the Ecuadorian government announced the reward for the capture of Mac\u00edas would be increased to $1 million.",

      "NATO\u2019s summit in the Netherlands has been described as \u201ctransformational\u201d and \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- NATO\u2019s summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday has been described as \u201ctransformational\u201d and \u201chistoric.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing the birth of a new NATO,\" Finland\u2019s President Alexander Stubb said.",
      "The 32 members of the world\u2019s biggest security organization endorsed a plan to massively ramp up defense spending, \u201cback to the defense expenditure levels of the Cold War,\u201d as Stubb put it, driven by U.S. President Donald Trump and fears of the security threat posed by Russia.",
      "Here are some of the takeaways from the two-day meeting in The Hague.",
      "The nonbinding spending agreement means a steep budget hike for NATO's European members and Canada that will cost them tens of billions of dollars.",
      "It\u2019s a major revamp of the way NATO calculates defense spending. Until now, the allies had set a target of 2% of gross domestic product for their defense budgets. Now they\u2019ll be aiming for 3.5% by 2035.",
      "They\u2019ll now be able to include weapons and ammunition they supply to Ukraine in the equation, making the new target slightly easier to reach, but still difficult for Canada and a number of European countries with economic troubles.",
      "On top of that, the allies will dedicate 1.5% of their GDP to upgrading infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, ports and airfields \u2014 needed to deploy armies to the front. Money spent on protecting networks or preparing societies for future conflict can be included.",
      "Progress will be reviewed in 2029, after the next U.S. presidential election.",
      "Not everyone is on board. Spain officially refused the agreement. Slovakia had reservations. Belgium, France and Italy will struggle to meet the new target.",
      "The leaders reaffirmed their \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to NATO\u2019s collective defense clause, Article 5. In recent years, Trump had sowed seeds of doubt about whether the U.S. \u2014 NATO\u2019s most powerful member \u2014 would come to the aid of any ally under attack.",
      "Trump had appeared to condition that support on higher defense spending. With NATO\u2019s new spending pledge in the bag, he told reporters that \u201cI left there saying that these people really love their countries. It\u2019s not a ripoff. And we\u2019re here to help them protect their country.\"",
      "He added that \u201cthey want to protect their country, and they need the United States, and without the United States, it\u2019s not going to be the same.\"",
      "After Russia invaded Ukraine by launching the biggest land conflict since World War II in 2022, NATO summits have largely focused on providing support to Kyiv. This summit was different.",
      "Previously, the emphasis was on Ukraine\u2019s membership prospects and on bringing it closer to NATO without actually joining. But the final summit statement this time made no such mention.",
      "Instead, the leaders underlined \u201ctheir enduring sovereign commitments to provide support to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was at the venue. He dined with other leaders at the Dutch king\u2019s residence, held talks with several leaders and spent half an hour or so with Trump.",
      "NATO\u2019s plan was to focus the meeting only on Trump\u2019s pet cause, defense spending. Foreign ministers did meet on the sidelines with their Ukrainian counterpart in an official NATO-Ukraine Council.",
      "In a minor win for Ukraine, and for allies needing to persuade citizens that their governments must spend more on defense, Russia was identified as the standout of the \u201cprofound security threats and challenges\u201d facing NATO.",
      "If there were doubts that the United States runs NATO, the summit removed them. A very shortened summit and one-page statement were prepared to keep the U.S. president happy and focused.",
      "As Trump flew to the Netherlands, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte sent a text message gushing about him being on the verge of a great achievement and saying, \u201cEurope is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win.\"",
      "Trump posted the message on social media. Rutte said he wasn\u2019t embarrassed and that it was all true.",
      "After the meeting, Trump said he came to the summit seeing it as a political chore, but he was leaving convinced that the assembled leaders love the alliance, their own countries and, mostly importantly, the United States.",
      "He called NATO leaders a \u201cnice group of people\u201d and said that \u201calmost every one of them said \u2018Thank God for the United States.\u2019\u201d",

      "Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, a major figure in the influential Apostolic Church, was arrested by Armenia's Investigative Committee, which accused him of planning to carry out bombings and arson attacks to disrupt power supplies and stage accidents on major roads to paralyze traffic. His lawyer described the charges as \u201cfiction.\u201d",
      "Galstanyan leads the Sacred Struggle opposition movement and has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who was the focus of protests last year by tens of thousands of demonstrators after Armenia agreed to hand over control of several border villages to bitter rival Azerbaijan and to normalize relations between the neighbors.",
      "Galstanyan leads the Tavush Diocese in northeastern Armenia and spearheaded a movement that opposed the handover of the villages in the country, which was once part of the Soviet Union. Although the territorial concession was the movement\u2019s core issue, it has expanded to a wide array of complaints about Pashinyan, who came to power in 2018.",
      "The decision to turn over the villages followed a lightning military campaign in September 2023, in which Azerbaijan\u2019s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate.",
      "Pashinyan wrote on social media that the security services had foiled a plot by \u201cthe criminal oligarch clergy to destabilize Armenia and take power.\u201d",
      "Officials said 13 others also were detained amid raids by police on the homes of dozens of opposition activists. The Investigative Committee said it carried out over 90 searches and recovered evidence that included firearms and ammunition.",
      "In addition to disputing the charges, Galstanyan\u2019s lawyer, Sergei Harutyunyan, said police searched the cleric's residence for six hours but found only smoke bombs that are commonly used at protests in Armenia.",
      "\u201cThey spent time studying every room, every closet, every letter; they recorded everything,\u201d Harutyunyan said.",
      "Attempts to impeach Pashinyan were unsuccessful, but the relationship between him and the Apostolic Church has deteriorated.",
      "On June 8, Pashinyan called for church leader Catholicos Karekin II to resign after accusing him of fathering a child despite a vow of celibacy. The church released a statement at the time accusing Pashinyan of undermining Armenia\u2019s \u201cspiritual unity\u201d but did not address the claim about the child.",
      "Pashinyan\u2019s claim sparked fresh anger among the church\u2019s followers, including Russian-Armenian billionaire Samvel Karapetyan, who appeared in a video saying that the religious institution was under attack.",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Youth-led protests against police brutality and poor governance have erupted across Kenya again on Wednesday, with thousands making their way to the central business district in the capital, Nairobi.",
      "The protests, which coincided with the first anniversary of demonstrations opposing tax hikes that left 60 people dead and 20 others missing, followed last week's rallies that demanded answers for the unexplained death of a Kenyan blogger while in police custody.",
      "Frustration is growing, especially among Generation Z, over police violence, economic struggles, and government mismanagement.",
      "The Communications Authority of Kenya has directed local media to stop all live broadcasts of the protests halfway through the day as President William Ruto warned that violence wouldn\u2019t be tolerated.",
      "Many turned to social media to share updates and remember slain protesters. Others posted anti-government messages and memes. On the streets, some could be seen offering protesters water.",
      "Here\u2019s why unrest is gripping Kenya:",
      "Calls for accountability have grown louder in Kenya after a street hawker was killed during last week's protests. A Kenyan court has given detectives 15 days to complete investigations into two police officers suspected of the shooting.",
      "This came as young people flooded social media platforms throughout the week with commemorations of protesters killed last year. At the time, Ruto apologized and vowed to end police brutality as the top police chief resigned.",
      "\u201cNot a single officer has been held to account,\u201d said Hussein Khaled, a human rights activist, adding that people took to the streets \u201cto demand justice in terms of compensation ... arrest of those officers who were involved ... police reforms because too many Kenyans are losing their lives\u201d to police brutality.",
      "Last year\u2019s deadly protests strongly opposed a finance bill that raised taxes significantly to address debt, putting an undue burden on young, educated people struggling with unemployment and a rising cost of living. Ruto later scrapped the bill.",
      "Some tax proposals were reintroduced later, drawing widespread criticism and calls for Ruto's resignation, following the appointment of a new but widely criticized cabinet. A revamped healthcare levy also changed standard premiums to a progressive tax, based on income.",
      "United Nations' data shows that 70% of sub-Saharan Africa is under the age of 30, with 67% of Kenya's young people unemployed.",
      "\u201cBoth the health and the education sectors, which greatly affect the youth, are seemingly sinking due to misguided policies and failure to provide needed resources. At the same time, there appears to be unlimited funds for \u2018aristocratic\u2019 luxuries,\u201d said Macharia Munene, professor of History and International Relations at United States International University Africa in Nairobi, referring to some state people\u2019s spending that has been strongly condemned.",
      "Ruto has been accused of misappropriating taxpayer money on lavish trips, most notably the use of a private jet on his trip to the United States right before last year\u2019s protests. He apologized and dismissed ministers accused of incompetence, corruption and displays of opulence amid complaints about the high cost of living.",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya's opposition received its share of criticism, with many saying it avoided challenging the status quo after some of its members were appointed in Ruto's new cabinet",
      "\u201cEnough is enough ... We are here for change, it is time for us to get our nation (back),\u201d said protestor Sevelina Mwihaki. \u201cThe blood that we have shed is enough.\"",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's top prosecutor on Wednesday submitted a new arrest warrant based on terrorism allegations for a Syrian man who stabbed and critically injured four men outside a restaurant in the western city of Bielefeld last month.",
      "The federal prosecutor's office said in a statement that the accused, who has only been identified as Mahmoud M. in line with German privacy rules, \u201cis urgently suspected of membership of a foreign terrorist organization, attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm.\u201d",
      "Last month, the defendant attacked several people with a knife outside a restaurant in downtown Bielefeld in the early morning. Four men were seriously injured.",
      "Prosecutors allege that the suspect follows an Islamist-jihadist ideology. He joined the Islamic State group in Syria in December 2014 at the latest in the city of Raqqa in Syria, they said.",
      "After entering Germany, prosecutors said the accused decided to kill as many randomly selected people in Germany as possible. He did so \u201din the name of a global 'holy war' and on behalf of Islamic State,\u201d they added.",
      "\u201cTo this end, in the early morning of May 18, 2025, he stabbed guests with knives in front of a restaurant in Bielefeld, critically injuring four people,\u201d the prosecutors said.",
      "The newly submitted arrest warrant replaces an arrest warrant issued by a Bielefeld local court on May 20, which had been obtained by the Bielefeld public prosecutor\u2019s office. M. was arrested on May 19, and has been in custody since then. On May 20, the federal prosecutor\u2019s office had taken over the investigation.",
      "Among other things, the federal prosecutor's office takes over terrorism-related cases from local prosecutors in Germany.",

      "A man armed with a samurai sword who killed a teenager on his way to school and injured five other people during what the prosecution said was a psychotic episode triggered by drug use has been convicted of murder",
      "LONDON -- A man armed with a samurai sword who killed a London teenager on his way to school and injured five other people during what the prosecution said was a psychotic episode triggered by drug use was convicted of murder on Wednesday.",
      "A jury at London's Central Criminal Court found Marcus Arduini Monzo guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin, along with three counts of attempted murder and one count each of grievous boldily harm, aggravated burglary and possessing a bladed article.",
      "The 37-year-old had admitted to carrying two samurai swords but denied all other charges.",
      "Monzo, who has dual Spanish and Brazilian citizenship, killed Anjorin during a 20-minute rampage in April 2024 in the Hainault area of northeast London that began when he struck a pedestrian with his van. He told the victim he was going to kill him and slashed the man's neck. The wounded man was able to get away and survived.",
      "Monzo then ambushed Anjorin, who was wearing headphones, and did not hear a neighbor yelling to warn him.",
      "\"We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out,\u201d Aiste Dabasinskaite said after the attack. \u201cHe had his headphones in so he wouldn\u2019t hear us. It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.\u201d",
      "Monzo nearly beheaded the teen with the 2-foot (60 cm) blade and stabbed him as he lay on the ground.",
      "When police officers arrived and tried to help the boy, Monzo sprang from bushes nearby and bolted. Constable Yasmin Mechem-Whitfield gave chase and suffered what police said were \u201cbrutal and life-changing\u201d injuries including a fractured skull and severe nerve damage when he lunged at her.",
      "Monzo then broke into a nearby home, where he awoke a couple who had been sleeping with their 4-year-old daughter. He shouted about believing in God and attacked the girl\u2019s father, wounding him in the neck and arm.",
      "In his final act of violence, he struck police Inspector Moloy Campbell once with the sword before he was subdued with a stun gun and arrested.",
      "Monzo said he had turned to yoga and went on a spiritual quest after being injured doing mixed martial arts. He said he formed his views after traveling to India and consuming ayahuasca, a hallucinogen, and frequently smoking marijuana.",
      "Prosecutors said Monzo\u2019s social media use showed an interest in violence, far-right extremism and conspiracy theories. He had shared vaccine misinformation and liked posts on X praising Adolf Hitler.",
      "During the trial, Monzo told jurors he believed the Earth was flat and that the 9/11 terrorist attack was \u201cprobably\u201d a conspiracy. He also spoke about his practice of drinking his own urine.",
      "He wept during his testimony and said he didn\u2019t intend to kill anyone when he bought two swords, which he claimed he intended to put on display.",
      "Also, Monzo said a voice in his head told him to kill his cat and then eat it to replenish the energy the animal sapped from him. He killed but did not eat the pet, then had a feeling an Armageddon-like ending was happening and panicked and embarked on what became a 20-minute attack, he said.",
      "Monzo is due to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "Jurors had to determine whether Monzo was responsible for his actions. Prosecutors said he carried out his rampage during a psychotic episode, but argued that it was brought on by his cannabis use, rather than an underlying mental health condition.",
      "Kirsty O\u2019Connor, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said that meant Monzo \"was fully responsible for the devastation he caused last year.",
      "\u201cThe jury, by their unequivocal verdicts, have accepted the prosecution case,\u201d she said. \u201cOur hearts go out to Daniel Anjorin\u2019s family and friends who have suffered his unimaginable loss in horrific circumstances, and our thoughts remain with all of the victims who continue to recover from their injuries and trauma.\"",

      "NEW DELHI -- Investigators have begun analyzing data extracted from the black boxes of the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner that crashed about two weeks ago, killing at least 270 people, India\u2019s civil aviation ministry said on Thursday.",
      "The data is crucial as it will help shed light on the cause of the country's worst aviation disaster in recent memory.",

      "\u201cThese efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Indian investigators recovered the black boxes from the wreckage site in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, a couple of days after the London-bound Air India flight 171 struck a residential area minutes after takeoff. The crash killed 241 people onboard and at least 29 on the ground. There was one survivor.",
      "The so-called \u201cblack box\u201d is one of the most important pieces of forensic evidence following a plane crash. There are typically two sturdy devices, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. And they\u2019re typically orange, not black.",

      "Following the June 12 crash, Indian authorities had ordered deeper checks of Air India\u2019s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner to prevent future incidents.",
      "Air India has 33 Dreamliner in its fleet. Inspection has been completed for at least 26 while four were undergoing long-term maintenance. The rest were expected to finish the safety checks soon.",

      "NUUK, Greenland -- For most of the year, Greenland is covered in ice and snow and its locals retreat indoors. But for three short months beginning in June, everyone heads outside \u2014 day and night \u2014 to watch or play soccer, the island's favorite sport.",
      "On an island of roughly 56,000 people, about 5,500 \u2014 nearly 10% of the population \u2014 are registered soccer players. So it was a crushing blow in early June when the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF, unanimously rejected the Greenlandic Football Association\u2019s application to become a member.",
      "Some blamed politics for the decision in light of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated wish to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island. CONCACAF is one of six continental federations under FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body that oversees the World Cup.",
      "The U.S. president hasn't ruled out military force despite strong rebukes from the governments of Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland. Danish and Greenlandic leaders say the island is not for sale and have condemned reports of the U.S. stepping up intelligence gathering on the semiautonomous Danish territory.",
      "But Patrick Frederiksen, captain of the national team, thinks CONCACAF\u2019s rejection came down to money.",
      "\u201cWe all know it\u2019s really expensive to travel to Greenland,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier this month, the first direct flight from the U.S. to Greenland by an American airline landed in the capital, Nuuk. The one-way ticket from Newark International Airport in New Jersey cost roughly $1,200. The return flight from Nuuk had a $1,300 to $1,500 price tag. Other flights require a layover in Iceland or Copenhagen, Denmark.",
      "CONCACAF didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Greenland, technically European territory, might have been expected to seek membership in UEFA. But the European federation only allows members from countries recognized as independent per sovereignty rules introduced in 2007. CONCACAF has no such restrictions.",
      "Despite the recent headlines, the Arctic island's inhabitants are more concerned this summer with getting to the nearest field. They want to take advantage of the 24-hour sunlight even if the temperatures hover around 5 to 10 degrees Celsius (41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) in Nuuk.",
      "\u201cWe meet outside and play football all night long,\u201d player Angutimmarik Kreutzmann said. \"It\u2019s not getting dark and we have so much freedom.\u201d",
      "From youth clubs to the national team, soccer energizes the entire island.",
      "Picturesque outdoor fields, featuring views of drifting icebergs and snow-capped mountain peaks even in late June, range from artificial turf to dirt to real grass, though older players remember dribbling across gravel pitches.",
      "\u201cYou should come watch a game,\u201d said Oscar Scott Carl, coach of the B-67 club in Nuuk. \u201cYou can see how much people go into the game, how much cheering from the attenders.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also a big part of creating unity in the country, having a sport to gather around and celebrate wins and being a part of something bigger than only football, to be honest,\u201d he added.",
      "The Kalaallit Arsaattartut Kattuffiat, Greenland's national football association, was founded in 1971 and regulates multiple men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Community projects are also important to the island's soccer culture and national team players serve as role models for local youth.",
      "\u201cThey want to take pictures with us or get our autograph,\u201d Frederiksen said. \u201cWe get a lot of attention and a lot support from the kids.\u201d",
      "During the long winter, many players turn to futsal. The sport is a form of indoor soccer, generally played with a special ball on a handball court with five players on a side.",
      "Even the national team plays: They traveled to Brazil in March for the Intercontinental Futsal Cup.",
      "The national team of the Faeroe Islands, a semi-independent Danish territory in the North Atlantic, is a member of FIFA and UEFA, which oversees European soccer.",
      "It's a sore spot for Greenlanders, especially after CONCACAF's decision. The Faeroe Islands team joined the tournaments more than three decades ago, before there were requirements such as a stadium with tens of thousands of seats, among others.",
      "Visit Greenland, the government's tourism agency, said that a national stadium has \"long been on the wish list for many in Greenland.\" But with such a small population, an arena with a minimum of 40,000 seats \u2014 more than 70% of the island's inhabitants \u2014 \u201cis sadly not in the pipeline,\u201d the agency wrote on its website.",
      "Still, Jimmy Holm Jensen, chairman of Nuuk's B-67 club, wishes Greenland's teams could at least play in international soccer tournaments. Right now, they only can compete in friendly matches abroad.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro signed into law on Wednesday a controversial labor overhaul with the potential to profoundly shift the balance of power from employers to workers, a key victory for the left-wing leader even as Congress compelled him to scale back his more radical ambitions.",
      "The enactment of the law marks a milestone for a president who has struggled to deliver on his promises to reduce inequality in one of the region's most unequal nations. But it's faced opposition from business leaders and Colombian government bonds have suffered as markets worry about the fiscal and economic effects.",
      "The law increases overtime pay for salaried workers and limits the use of short-term contract workers, while requiring companies to provide medical coverage and social security for gig workers like food delivery drivers. It also promises student interns proper contracts and benefits like vacation time and severance pay.",
      "Many of Petro\u2019s efforts to vastly expand social programs have stalled in Congress, with lawmakers shooting down this labor law twice. Lawmakers let the legislation squeak by last week after Petro\u2019s moved to call a public referendum.",
      "Petro signed the legislation at the historic home of 19th-century war hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who led South America's fight against imperial Spain.",
      "He posted on social media platform X: \u201cI sign the labor reform into law before Bol\u00edvar and the working people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must elect a government that will uphold this law and enforce it,\u201d Petro said, alluding to the 2026 presidential elections.",
      "The reform was cheered by trade unions and Petro\u2019s political allies Wednesday.",
      "But his push to strengthen worker protections has proved controversial, as the expensive benefits are expected to hike up costs for business owners. Petro\u2019s government has promised to push through a new bill to help small businesses, though the details remain unclear.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have painted a nightmare scenario of mass layoffs that will push more workers into Colombia\u2019s already vast informal economy.",
      "Many say that the mandated reductions in working hours, increases in overtime pay for Sunday and holiday shifts will especially squeeze small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "Already, his government\u2019s increased spending and reduced tax income have challenged fiscal stability.",
      "Critics also say that the changes won\u2019t help informal workers without contracts, who represent over half of Colombia\u2019s total labor force, according to the latest figures. The legislation guarantees health and pension benefits for only some gig workers, such as app-based delivery workers.",
      "Then there\u2019s the question of compliance. \u201cI want to tell those employers who say they won\u2019t implement the labor reform that they\u2019re not intelligent,\u201d Petro said on Wednesday.",
      "Even as he hailed the law, it fell short of Petro's ambitions. He was forced to compromise on some key provisions to push it through a hostile Congress.",
      "Provisions stripped from the final version included extended paternity leave, paid leave for women with debilitating menstrual pain and some collective bargaining rights for unions.",
      "The signing of the law comes at a tumultuous time for the third largest nation in Latin America, with a wave of bombing attacks shaking the northeast and an assassination attempt on conservative presidential hopeful and senator Miguel Uribe stunning the country. Uribe remains in intensive care.",

      "Kim has been pushing to make the country a tourism hub as part of efforts to revive the ailing economy, and the Wonsan-Kalma zone is one of his most talked-about tourism projects. KCNA reported North Korea will confirm plans to build large tourist sites in other parts of the country, too.",

      "Denis Villeneuve is going from \u201cDune\u201d to Bond",
      "NEW YORK -- Denis Villeneuve is going from \u201cDune\u201d to Bond.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios announced Wednesday that Villeneuve will direct the next James Bond movie. The untitled film will be the first since the studio took creative reins of the storied film franchise after decades of control by the Broccoli family.",
      "Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman had maintained that before the next Bond is cast, they would develop a screenplay and find a director first. Now, they have one of the most respected blockbuster makers in Hollywood, who's coming off a pair of widely acclaimed \u201cDune\u201d films.",
      "In a statement, the 57-year-old French Canadian filmmaker said he grew up watching Bond movies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Since taking creative control of Bond in February, Amazon MGM has worked quickly to get the next movie going. The studio is also trying to win over fans skeptical of the new corporate leadership and the fearful of future spinoffs.",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "With Pascal and Heyman lodged as producers and Villeneuve behind the camera, the next Bond movie will have an enviable brain trust. Villeneuve beat out a field of directors floated for the movie including Edward Berger (\"Conclave\"), Paul King (\"Paddington 2\"), Edgar Wright (\"Baby Driver\") and Jonathan Nolan, co-creator of \u201cWestworld\u201d and brother to Christopher Nolan.",
      "\u201cDenis Villeneuve has been in love with James Bond movies since he was a little boy,\" said Pascal and Heyman. \u201cIt was always his dream to make this movie, and now it\u2019s ours, too.\u201d",
      "No release date has been announced for the next Bond movie. Villeneuve will shoot the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer. If production on Bond began next year, a release sometime in 2027 would be likely.",
      "Villenevue's first two \u201cDune\u201d films have together surpassed $1 billion in box office worldwide and been nominated for a combined 15 Academy Awards, winning seven. His other films include \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d \u201cArrival,\u201d \u201cSicario,\u201d \u201cPrisoners,\u201d \u201cEnemy\u201d and \u201cIncendies.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, but didn't gain creative control of the studio's most prized asset until this year. Until this film, every Bond director has been handpicked by the Broccolis.",

    "story": [
      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

    "story": [
      "Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade",
      "WASHINGTON -- While completing a master\u2019s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia.",
      "Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her.",
      "\u201cIt stings a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.\u201d",
      "Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades.",
      "The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth.",
      "\u201cYoung people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,\u201d Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. \u201cThe people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.\u201d",
      "The growth of artifical intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law.",
      "Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992.",
      "While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes.",
      "The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months.",
      "The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate \u2014 new hires as a percentage of all jobs \u2014 has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy.",
      "For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March \u2014 the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate.",
      "Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came.",
      "\u201cNobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,\u201d Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. \"My resume is full, there\u2019s no gaps or anything. Every summer I\u2019m doing something. It\u2019s just, \u2018OK, so what else are you looking for?\u2019\u201d",
      "She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year.",
      "Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin.",
      "Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, \u201cteams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.\u201d",
      "Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate work force over the next few years.",
      "\u201cWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\u201d Jassy said in a message to employees. \u201cWe expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\u201d",
      "Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, \u201cWhy hire a human when you could use AI?\u201d",
      "Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology.",
      "Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,\u201d Kantenga said.",
      "He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow.",
      "In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low \u2014 fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing \u2014 left many firms with too many workers, economists say.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak.",
      "Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field.",
      "She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said.",
      "She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet.",
      "\u201cI will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,\u201d she said.",

      "It\u2019s the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn\u2019t contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers\u2019 changing nutritional needs and preferences.",

      "Bumble did not immediately specify when it would implement the layoffs or which roles would be affected. But its securities filing signaled that the process would extend into later in the year \u2014 noting that it expects to incur costs related to the layoffs, including severance for impacted employees, amounting to anywhere between $13 million to $18 million primarily in its third and fourth fiscal quarters.",
      "In a note to employees Wednesday, Bumble CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd wrote that \u201cBumble, like the online dating industry itself, is at an inflection point.\u201d She noted that the company has been \u201crebuilding\u201d in recent months, which \u201crequires hard decisions.\u201d",
      "Wolfe Herd founded Bumble in 2014, just two years after co-founding Tinder in 2012. She had previously served as Bumble's CEO from 2020 through January 2024, and stepped back into the top seat in March.",
      "Bumble has struggled on the market since going public in 2021. While shares popped up on Wednesday, its stock is still down more than 35% over the last year \u2014 and nearly 92% since its February 2021 debut.",
      "In its most recent first quarter earnings, Bumble reported a total revenue of about $247 million \u2014 down nearly 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said Wednesday that it expects to rake between $244 million and $249 million for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year. That's up from previous estimates \u2014 but still lower than the $269 million it reported for its second quarter in 2024.",

      "NEW YORK -- Europeans still aren't buying Teslas with figures out Wednesday showing sales plunged for a fifth month in a row in May, a blow to investors who had hoped anger toward Elon Musk would have faded by now.",
      "Tesla sales fell 28% last month in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. The poor showing comes after Tesla's billionaire CEO had promised a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d was coming last month, adding to a recent buying frenzy among investors.",
      "They were selling on Wednesday, pushing the prices down more than 4% in early afternoon trading.",
      "Musk had said Tesla was sure to get a boost once the company was done retooling its factories to produce a new version of its biggest seller, the Model Y. But that was finished months ago, and the new models are widely available. Investors are now hoping that a cheaper Tesla expected to be out later year will help reverse the sales decline.",
      "Overall, battery electric vehicle sales rose 25% in Europe compared to a year earlier. The market for EVs was particularly strong in Germany, where Musk has angered potential buyers by publicly supporting the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party in elections. Overall EV sales there leapt 45%.",
      "China\u2019s SAIC Motor was the big winner for the month with its European sales of EVs and other kinds of cars jumping 38%. That has allowed the company to leapfrog Tesla, which a year ago was selling more cars in the region.",
      "SAIC sold 18,716 vehicles last month versus Tesla\u2019s 8,729.",
      "The sales drop for Tesla comes at a crucial time for the company as it launches a test run of its driverless \u2018robotaxis\u2019 service in Austin, Texas. Musk says that if goes well, he expects to introduce the service in several other cities in quick succession and have as many as a million of the automated cabs on roads by the end of the year.",
      "Reviews so far have been mostly good, but the service is limited to a dozen or so cars and some passengers have circulated videos of problems during their rides, including one showing a robotaxi heading down a lane for opposing traffic.",
      "Federal traffic safety regulators said Tuesday they were looking into the videos.",

      "The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company announced the plan during a corporate earnings call last Friday. The company hasn\u2019t said which stores it plans to shutter, but said the closures will happen around the country. It also said employees at impacted stores will be offered jobs at other locations.",
      "\u201cWe see this as an opportunity to move these closed store sales to other stores, and we think that should improve profitability,\u201d Kroger\u2019s interim Chairman and CEO Ronald Sargent said during the call.",

      "A message seeking details of the company's plans was left Wednesday with Kroger.",
      "Kroger is the nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain, with 2,731 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. It operates stores under multiple brand names, including Smith\u2019s, Ralphs, King Soopers and Fred Meyer.",
      "Sargent said Kroger usually evaluates the performance of individual stores on an annual basis but it deferred any store closings during its two-year effort to merge with rival Albertsons. The two companies announced the $24.6 billion merger plan in 2022 but the deal fell apart late last year after two judges blocked it due to concerns about competition.",
      "Kroger's plan to close stores comes as the company is facing labor unrest over issues including chronic understaffing at stores, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Union members in Southern California began picketing at a Los Angeles Ralphs last week. Workers at King Soopers stores in Colorado also went on strike earlier this year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs will likely push up inflation in the coming months, even as some Republican senators suggested the chair was biased against the duties.",
      "On the second day of his twice-yearly testimony before the House and Senate, Powell said that consumers will likely have to shoulder some of the cost of the import taxes. Most Fed officials support cutting rates this year, Powell added, but the central bank wants to take time to see how inflation changes in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cThere will be some inflation from tariffs coming,\" Powell said under questioning from members of the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cNot yet, but over the course of the coming months.\u201d",
      "Powell noted that the duties would likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and \u201csome of that is going to fall on the consumer. We're just kind of waiting to see more data on that.\"",
      "Some GOP senators criticized Powell, however, for characterizing tariffs as a potential driver of inflation. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Republican from Nebraska, argued that the duties could simply act as a one-time increase in prices that wouldn't fuel inflation.",
      "And Sen. Bernie Moreno, a Republican from Ohio, echoed some of Trump's complaints about Powell's reluctance to cut rates and accused Powell of political bias.",
      "\u201cYou should consider whether you are looking at this through a fiscal lens or a political lens because you just don\u2019t like tariffs,\u201d Moreno said. Powell didn't respond.",
      "But the Fed chair reiterated that most central bank officials do support cutting the Fed's key rate this year. And Powell added that it is possible that tariffs won't increase inflation by very much.",
      "Trump has sharply criticized Powell for not reducing borrowing costs, calling him a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and a \u201cfool.\u201d Trump has pushed for rate cuts in order to reduce the interest costs the federal government pays on its debt. Yet some Fed officials have pushed back against that view, saying that it's not their job to lower the government's borrowing costs.",
      "So far, inflation has steadily cooled this year despite widespread concerns among economists about the impact of tariffs. The consumer price index ticked up just 0.1% from April to May, the government said last week, a sign that price pressures are muted.",
      "Compared with a year ago, consumer prices rose 2.4% in May, up from a yearly increase of 2.3% in April.",
      "Yet most economists on Wall Street expect that Trump's tariffs will lift inflation this year, to about 3% to 3.5% by the end of this year.",

      "Big families looking for a three-row electric SUV have more options than ever before thanks to a few new arrivals",
      "Most electric vehicles are five-passenger sedans or SUVs. But automakers are increasingly expanding their lineups to cater to shoppers wanting a three-row EV that can serve as a family hauler. These EVs can seat six or seven passengers, haul lots of cargo, and potentially have more than 300 miles of driving range. They also come standard with many advanced safety features. To help you with your search, the car experts at Edmunds rounded up five of their favorites. They are ordered by price, and all pricing includes destination charges.",
      "The most affordable three-row SUV on the list is one of Edmunds\u2019 favorite electric SUVs. The EV9 delivers lots of safety features, a very comfortable ride, and plenty of passenger space in all three rows. The EV9 is also a good road tripper because it\u2019s one of the quickest-charging electric SUVs when hooked up to a powerful fast-charging station. Adding to its appeal is its ability to tow up to 5,000 pounds.",
      "The base EV9 Light trim level has an attractive starting price but comes up short on power and range. Instead, Edmunds recommends getting the midrange EV9 Wind. The Wind has a more suitable amount of power and an EPA-estimated 280 miles of range on a full charge. It also comes with all-wheel drive for more traction in wet and snowy conditions.",
      "2025 EV9 starting price: $56,395",
      "Hyundai\u2019s newest electric SUV is sleek and futuristic while providing what families need. It essentially serves as an electric alternative to Hyundai\u2019s highly rated Palisade. Like its corporate cousin, the Kia EV9, the Ioniq 9 has luxury levels of comfort, roomy seating in all rows, lots of standard safety features, and fast charging speeds.",
      "But the Ioniq 9 boasts a longer max range of 335 miles, which is impressive for a large SUV. And that\u2019s in the most affordable S model. All other models offer over 300 miles, which is more than the EV9. The top Calligraphy Design model is about as lush and powerful as a luxury SUV and offers neat tech features like a fingerprint scanner that starts the SUV and sets personalized settings.",
      "2026 Ioniq 9 starting price: $60,555",
      "If you\u2019re looking to stand out from the crowded sea of mainstream SUVs, consider the ID. Buzz. This electric minivan\u2019s retro styling is a throwback to the old VW Bus, but beneath the quirky design is a cavernous interior. Passengers, even tall ones, have more than enough headroom and legroom in all three rows. Drivers enjoy a high and commanding view of the road ahead.",
      "Thanks to the van\u2019s tall and boxy body, there\u2019s loads of cargo space behind the third row. Maximum cargo space is comparable to that of minivans and large SUVs. The Buzz also comes standard with a package of advanced safety features, but its maximum driving range of 234 miles will limit its appeal if you plan on a lot of long-distance driving.",
      "2025 ID. Buzz starting price: $61,545",
      "This electric luxury SUV hails from Rivian, a relatively new American EV startup. Debuting in 2022, the R1S was one of the first three-row electric SUVs and is a compelling choice if you can afford its high price tag. Rivian has also been making small but significant improvements to the R1S each year.",
      "There are a variety of 2025 R1S configurations to choose from, including versions that provide a long range of up to 410 miles and performance models touting 1,025 horsepower. The R1S also comes standard with height-adjustable air suspension that you can use to get more ground clearance when off-roading. The R1S also has plenty of passenger and cargo space, a premium interior, and lots of standard advanced safety features.",
      "2025 R1S starting price: $77,700",
      "Mercedes\u2019 EQS SUV is ideal for shoppers looking for a family-friendly EV that delivers a genuine luxury experience. The EQS impresses with its supremely smooth ride, premium cabin design, and extensive list of standard tech and safety features. The base 450+ model gets an EPA-estimated range of 323 miles. In the independent Edmunds EV Range Test, it went substantially farther, going 407 miles on a full charge.",
      "On the downside, the EQS SUV\u2019s third-row seat is an option. And if you get it, you\u2019ll find that it isn\u2019t as roomy as those in the other EVs on our list. The EQS\u2019 price might also be a prohibitive factor. But few SUVs, electric or gas, offer the EQS SUV\u2019s combination of future-forward design, opulent comfort and impressive functionality.",
      "2025 EQS SUV starting price: $106,400",
      "The SUVs above make up most of the electric three-row options in today\u2019s market. Fortunately, they are all excellent choices for families wanting lots of space, ample range and advanced safety features.",

      "If teachers are using chatbots for grading they should be aware the tools are good for \u201clow-level\u201d grading like multiple choice tests but less effective when nuance is required. There should be a way for students to alert teachers if the grading is too harsh or inconsistent, and the final grading decision needs to remain with the educator, she said.",
      "About 8 in 10 teachers who use AI tools say it saves them time on work tasks like making worksheets, assessments, quizzes or on administrative work. And about 6 in 10 teachers who use AI tools said they are improving the quality of their work when it comes to modifying student materials, or giving student feedback.",
      "\u201cAI has transformed how I teach. It\u2019s also transformed my weekends and given me a better work-life balance,\u201d said Mary McCarthy, a high school social studies teacher in the Houston area who has used AI tools for help with lesson plans and other tasks.",
      "McCarthy said training she received from her school district on AI tools has helped her model proper use for her students.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m on the soapbox of, \u2018AI is bad and kids are going to get dumb,\u2019 well yeah if we don\u2019t teach them how to use the tool,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cIt feels like my responsibility as the adult in the room to help them figure out how to navigate this future.\u201d",
      "Views on the role of artificial intelligence in education have shifted dramatically since ChatGPT launched in late 2022. Schools around the country initially banned it, but since then many have sought ways to incorporate it into classrooms. Concerns about student overuse and misuse are still prevalent: About half of teachers worry that student use of AI will decrease teens\u2019 ability to think critically and independently or to have persistence when problem solving, according to the study.",
      "One benefit teachers see in becoming more familiar with artificial intelligence is the ability to spot when students are overusing it.",
      "Clues that assignments are written by AI tools include an absence of grammatical errors and complex phrases in writing, said Colorado high school English teacher Darren Barkett. He said he relies on ChatGPT himself to create lesson plans and grade multiple choice tests and essays.",
      "In suburban Chicago, middle school art teacher Lindsay Johnson said she uses only AI programs vetted by her school and deemed safe to use with minors, for data privacy and other concerns. To ensure students feel confident in their skills, she said she brings the technology in only for later stages of projects.",
      "For her 8th graders' final assessment, Johnson asked them to make a portrait of an influential person in their lives. After students put final touches on their subject's face, Johnson introduced generative AI for those who wanted help designing the background. She used an AI tool within Canva, after checking with her district's IT department that the design software passed its privacy screener.",
      "\u201cAs an art teacher my goal is to let them know the different tools that are out there and to teach them how those tools work,\u201d she said. Some students weren\u2019t interested in the help. \u201cHalf the class said, \u2018I\u2019ve got a vision, and am going to keep going with it.\u2019\u201d",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has signed into law a bill that provides unemployment benefits to striking workers",
      "SALEM, Ore. -- Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek on Tuesday signed into law a bill that provides unemployment benefits to striking workers, following neighboring Washington state in adopting measures spurred by recent walkouts by Boeing factory workers, hospital nurses and teachers in the Pacific Northwest.",
      "Oregon\u2019s measure makes it the first state to provide pay for picketing public employees \u2014 who aren\u2019t allowed to strike in most states, let alone receive benefits for it. It makes striking workers eligible to collect unemployment benefits after two weeks, with benefits capped at 10 weeks.",
      "Only three other states \u2014 New York, New Jersey and most recently Washington state \u2014 give striking workers unemployment benefits. Washington's bill, which passed in April, pays striking private sector workers for up to six weeks, starting after at least two weeks on the line.",
      "Democratic Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Monday vetoed a bill that would provide financial help for striking workers, after vetoing a similar measure last year.",
      "The final passage for Oregon's bill proved tumultuous. It first passed the state Senate in March and then passed the state House earlier this month. But a majority of senators did not concur with amendments added by the House, which sent the measure to a conference committee to resolve the differences between the two bills. It ultimately received final approval following a compromise on the 10-week benefits cap.",
      "The bill sparked debate among lawmakers as well as constituents, with over 1,000 letters of written testimony submitted.",
      "Supporters said it would level the playing field between workers and wealthy corporations that can wait until union strike funds run out to pressure employees under financial distress to accept deals.",
      "Opponents said it could incentivize strikes and hurt employers, particularly public employers such as school districts. Private employers pay into the state\u2019s unemployment insurance trust fund through a payroll tax, but many public employers do not, meaning they would have to reimburse the fund for any payments made to their workers.",
      "In response to those concerns, the bill requires school districts to deduct the benefits received by an employee from their future wages.",
      "Some argued it wouldn\u2019t cost public employers more than what they have already budgeted for salaries, as workers aren\u2019t paid when they are on strike. Also, those receiving unemployment benefits get at most 65% of their weekly pay, and benefit amounts are capped, according to documents presented to lawmakers by employment department officials.",
      "Oregon has seen two large strikes in recent years: Thousands of nurses and dozens of doctors at Providence\u2019s eight Oregon hospitals were on strike for six weeks earlier this year, while a 2023 walkout of Portland Public Schools teachers shuttered schools for over three weeks in the state\u2019s largest district.",

      "Additionally, the House bill proposes $12 billion for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The Senate package also provides the attorney general with $3.5 billion to create a similar state fund \u2014 called Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or Biden, referring to the former president.",

      "Louisiana accused pharmaceutical giant CVS of using its dominant market position to abuse customer information, drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana filed several lawsuits accusing pharmaceutical giant CVS of abusing customer information and using its dominant market position to drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies, the state\u2019s attorney general said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill began investigating CVS after the company sent out mass text messages to thousands of residents on June 11 to lobby against legislation that took aim at its business structure. The texts warned that medication costs could go up and all CVS pharmacies in the state would close.",
      "The lawsuits, which were filed Monday in central Louisiana\u2019s St. Landry Parish, seek \u201cinjunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution,\" Murrill said.",
      "CVS \u201cabused customers\u2019 sensitive information to push a political message,\u201d Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said Tuesday at a press conference.",
      "He noted CVS had lobbied his wife over text via the same messaging chain normally used to notify her about picking up a prescription drug or other healthcare-related matters.",
      "One lawsuit argues that the text message lobbying constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\" in violation of state trade law.",
      "CVS has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cOur communication with CVS customers, patients and members of the community was consistent with the law,\u201d CVS said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe it was important for people to know about a potential disruption to where they get their medicine.\u201d",
      "Two other lawsuits allege that CVS artificially inflates prices for consumers and independent pharmacies.",
      "CVS serves as a pharmacy benefit manager \u2014 essentially an intermediary that buys medication from manufacturers and distributes drugs to pharmacies.",
      "CVS and the mail-order pharmacy Express Scripts dominate the market by processing about eight out of every 10 prescription drug claims, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which warned in a 2024 report that this allows for \u201cinflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.\"",
      "Because CVS also owns a vast network of retail pharmacies \u2014 including 119 in Louisiana \u2014 it sets the terms for how prescription drugs are sold to customers there.",
      "The proposed law that sparked the text messages from CVS had sought to ban pharmacy benefit managers like CVS from owning drug stores. The law failed to pass, but Landry has stated he will seek to revive it.",
      "In the state's litigation, Murrill alleges that CVS business structure and practices allow the company to \u201cmanipulate prices, restrict competition and channel profits internally.\"",
      "One lawsuit accuses CVS of \u201csystematically under-reimbursing independent Louisiana pharmacies to the point of economic hardship, while routing patients to CVS-owned facilities.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that CVS imposes \u201cunethical, unscrupulous, and exorbitantly high fees on independent pharmacies.\u201d",
      "CVS said that it should not have to pay higher rates for \u201cless efficient pharmacies\u201d and that this would lead to \u201chigher costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "\u201cImportantly, CVS Pharmacy remains the lowest cost pharmacy and a critical partner in lowering prescription drug costs for Louisianans,\u201d the company said.",
      "Another lawsuit argues that CVS uses its market control to exclude lower-cost drugs for \"high-rebate, high-price brand drugs\u201d and other practices that \u201cdistort the drug market\u201d and \u201cdrive up costs for the state's public health programs and its citizens.\u201d",
      "CVS said that its business structure allows for \u201cbetter access, affordability, and advocacy for those we serve.\u201d The company said that removing CVS pharmacies from Louisiana would increase costs to the state by more than $4.6 million.",
      "Landry said he would seek new legislation targeting CVS if existing laws were insufficient to win in court.",

      "Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR\u2019s 15 race teams told a federal judge that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR's 15 race teams argued in federal court Tuesday that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance and warned that making such details public would put them all in danger.",
      "The hearing was over a discovery dispute between NASCAR and the teams that are not parties in the ongoing antitrust suit filed by 23XI Racing, which is owned by retired NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins.",
      "23XI and Front Row are the only two organizations out of the 15 that refused last September to sign take-it-or-leave offers on a new charter agreement. Charters are NASCAR\u2019s version of a franchise model, with each charter guaranteeing entry to the lucrative Cup Series races and a stable revenue stream. Of the 13 teams that signed, only Kaulig Racing has submitted the financial documents NASCAR subpoenaed as part of discovery.",
      "The other 12 organizations are fighting against releasing the information to NASCAR and even argued that NASCAR asking for them violates the charter agreement, which claims all disputes must go to arbitration.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell of the Western District of North Carolina promised a quick ruling but, just like last week, seemed exasperated at the lengths being taken in this brawl that for now is heading toward a December trial.",
      "\u201cI am amazed at the effort going into burning this house down over everybody's heads,\u201d Bell said at the end of the nearly two-hour hearing. \u201cBut I'm the fire marshal and I will be here in December if need be.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the teams say their financial records are private and there is no guarantee the information won't be leaked; in a hearing last week, information learned in discovery was disclosed in open court.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely devastating to these race teams if their competitors were able to find out sponsorships on the cars, driver salaries and all revenue streams,\u201d attorney Adam Ross said. \u201cIt cannot make its way into the public realm.\u201d",
      "Ross said NASCAR has asked for 11 years of records and communications \u2014 including what Hendrick Motorsports spent on both its Garage 56 project building a car to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the cost of Kyle Larson running both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cNASCAR has gone a step too far,\u201d Ross said.",
      "NASCAR argued it needs the financials to understand profit margins and whether teams are actually unable to make ends meet under the charter agreement. NASCAR vowed to redact details to conceal team identities, a suggestion that was met with skepticism from team attorneys who contended it would be easy to connect the dots and, for example, figure out which contracts belong to, say, Team Penske.",
      "Attorneys also argued that money is not often distributed equally across the board with each team. For example, Team Penske might use an engineer for a NASCAR team, an IndyCar team and a sports car team.",
      "Bell asked NASCAR why it would not be satisfied with just \u201ctopline\u201d numbers.",
      "\u201cWhy is not enough to know it costs X to run a car?\u201d Bell asked.",
      "Attorneys for the 12 teams also noted that their clients are extremely uncomfortable to be dragged into the suit.",
      "\u201cThis is the opposite of what they want \u2014 all the teams are torn to pieces that NASCAR wants them to disclose this information and they don't want to upset NASCAR,\u201d Ross said.",
      "Teams have long argued that NASCAR is not financially viable and they needed multiple concessions, including a greater revenue stream and a more permanent length on the charter agreements. Those presently have expiration dates and can be revoked by NASCAR. Two years of negotiations ended last fall with 13 teams signing on but 23IX and FRM instead heading to court.",
      "The hearing came one day after Bell declined to dismiss the teams\u2019 request to toss out NASCAR\u2019s countersuit, which accuses Jordan business manager Curtis Polk of using \u201ccartel\u201d-type tactics in the most recent round of charter negotiations.",

      "You just retired (or are about to)",
      "If there\u2019s a single group of people who are likely to be experiencing the most consternation over recent market events, it\u2019s those who have just retired or who are on the cusp of hanging it up.",
      "But as with most things in life, the key for new- and near-retirees making it through this period with their sanity intact is to focus on what they can control.",
      "People who have just retired or are about to do so are vulnerable to sequence-of-returns risk, which means that a bad market shows up early in retirement. And this imperils your portfolio\u2019s ability to last throughout your retirement years.",
      "Retirees who are pulling cash flows from their portfolios can address that risk by adjusting spending down to ensure that more of their portfolios are in place to recover when the market eventually does.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that tweaks like forgoing an inflation adjustment following a bear market help ensure that spending lasts over a 30-year period.",
      "If you haven\u2019t yet retired, assess your planned in-retirement spending and identify where you could make cutbacks if needed.",
      "Ideally, you can pull portfolio cash flows from safer assets and leave your stock positions undisturbed.",
      "That\u2019s the general logic behind the Bucket approach to portfolio construction. In good years for the stock market, harvest appreciated equity assets for income. In bad ones, don\u2019t touch stocks but instead source cash flows from high-quality bonds or cash.",
      "Using that logic, you may even want to reinvest income distributions back into securities that have recently lost value rather than spending them.",
      "If pulling too much from a portfolio during down markets is a bad idea, filing for Social Security might look compelling.",
      "But it could be a mistake to let what we hope will be a short-lived downturn steer you away from the lifetime benefits of delayed Social Security. Delayed filing can be particularly impactful if you\u2019re the higher earner in your family and you have a younger spouse who will receive that higher benefit for her lifetime.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that the benefits of delaying filing until age 70 are greatest if you have other funds to draw from until then. And they\u2019re obviously more valuable for people with above-average life expectancies, in that they stand to receive that inflation-protected income for longer.",
      "If you need funds and have to choose between filing for Social Security and pulling from a depressed equity portfolio, consider filing for Social Security and then doing a \u201c withdrawal of benefits \u201d within a year of when you initially filed.",
      "Inflation is a key risk for retiree portfolios, because the income you receive from your safe investments is going to buy you less as you age.",
      "Many retirees focus exclusively on nominal bonds and underrate the value of inflation-protected bonds, but most of the better target-date series stake about a fourth of the bond positions in short-term Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities for people who have just retired.",
      "Another strategy is to build a laddered portfolio of TIPS that will mature and supply you with living expenses throughout your retirement.",
      "Finally, one small silver lining in market volatility is the opportunity to save on taxes.",
      "The early-retirement years are an excellent time to convert traditional IRA balances to Roth. The reason is that without income from work and because you won\u2019t be subject to required minimum distributions until you\u2019re 73, your income and, in turn, the taxes that you\u2019ll owe on conversions will be lower.",

      "How things have changed.",
      "More than half a million tickets have already been sold for the 31 matches of this year's edition of the tournament, which kicks off next week in Switzerland.",
      "Organizers expect to break the attendance record of 575,000 set at the previous women's euros in England in 2022 when 87,000 people packed into Wembley Stadium for the final.",
      "The popularity of women\u2019s soccer in Europe \u2014 and around the world \u2014 has accelerated in leaps and bounds in recent years. Players are becoming stronger, faster and more technically skilled, making the game more entertaining to watch.",
      "While it hasn\u2019t yet closed the gap with men\u2019s soccer in revenue, the women\u2019s game is seeing rapid growth in investment at both the international and club level. Players who started their careers over a decade ago say the pace of change has been stunning.",
      "\u201cIf you look at a match from five years ago, it has nothing to do with the ones being played now,\u201d said Barcelona\u2019s two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas, who made her senior debut in 2010.",
      "The 31-year-old Spain midfielder told The Associated Press that her generation and earlier generations never thought they would be able to make a living from playing soccer when they grew up.",
      "\u201cFor sure it\u2019s about making our sport a little more visible, so that girls can dream of being soccer players,\" she said. \u201cI think that in recent years there has been a very good evolution. In the end, we just needed people to invest in us, to help us improve, and I think that change is happening.\"",
      "Governing bodies have set up initiatives to drive the game forward, such as European soccer body UEFA\u2019s \u201cUnstoppable\u201d strategy \u2014 aimed at making football the most-played team sport for women and girls in every European country by 2030, while increasing the number of professional leagues across the continent.",
      "A major shift has happened at the club level, as Europe's powerhouse clubs such as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Chelsea started taking women\u2019s soccer seriously.",
      "More women\u2019s leagues across Europe have turned professional over the past decade, inspiring a new generation of female soccer players.",
      "\u201cIn the last decade real progress happened, especially on the club side. You see real professionalization,\u201d Norway FA president Lise Klaveness told AP. \u201cIt is very important to have a full pyramid that girls can see that they can have this as a job.\u201d",
      "She said the real DNA in soccer is the connection with local clubs.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t really had that with women. Now you see it more and more,\u201d she said.",
      "She added that many top leaders on the men's side show real ambitions to raise their women's teams.",
      "\u201cIf you meet the Arsenal president or (Joan) Laporta at Barcelona he feels very close to his women\u2019s team. When the women\u2019s team plays, he is there,\u201d Klaveness said.",
      "As the club game has gotten bigger \u2014 England\u2019s top women\u2019s league is expanding \u2014 so have the international competitions.",
      "At Euro 1984, there were just four teams in the inaugural tournament: England, Italy, Sweden and Denmark.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until 1997 that it was expanded to eight teams, becoming 12 in 2009 and increased to the current format of 16 from the 2017 edition.",
      "At Euro 2009 there was an average attendance of just over 5,000 at the matches in England. In the same country in 2022, the average was 18,544.",
      "And just as attendance levels have soared, so have television viewing figures.",
      "Euro 2022 had a global cumulative live viewership of 365 million across TV, out-of-home viewing and streaming. That was more than double the number of live viewers compared to the 2017 edition (178 million) and 214% more live viewers than in 2013 (116 million).",
      "The rise in attendances is also evident in club soccer as women start playing in stadiums with bigger capacities and clubs start to invest more in their women\u2019s teams. A couple of Barcelona's Women's Champions League matches in 2022 drew more than 90,000 fans.",
      "A major change that's happened in recent years is investors are now looking at women's soccer as something you can make money off, said Seattle Reign coach Laura Harvey, who coached Arsenal and Birmingham City in her native England before moving to the U.S.",
      "\u201cFor those of us who\u2019ve been in this a long time \u2014 I was Birmingham City\u2019s head coach in 2006 \u2014 and to think where the game\u2019s evolved in 19 years or whatever it\u2019s been, it\u2019s just wild,\u201d she told AP. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I can be part of it.\u201d",
      "The continued growth in popularity of women\u2019s soccer has the knock-on effect of more sponsorship, more prize money and more to invest in grassroots soccer and clubs.",
      "In 2017, UEFA made what was perceived as a bold move: unbundling sponsorship rights for its women\u2019s competitions and selling the commercial rights separately from the men\u2019s.",
      "That was done with the express purpose of \u201caccelerating the growth of women\u2019s football competitions\u201d and was considered a success.",
      "So much so that FIFA has followed suit, as have governing bodies of other sports.",
      "UEFA now counts 11 dedicated women\u2019s soccer partners among its wider portfolio, including Visa, Amazon and Adidas.",
      "There are more than 20 sponsors for Euro 2025 and that revenue is projected to increase by 145% compared to 2022, according to UEFA.",
      "\u201cThe impact of Women\u2019s Euro 2025 extends far beyond the competition itself,\u201d UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said in a report last month. \u201cWith record prize money and unprecedented interest from sponsors, the tournament will bring more investment into the women\u2019s game than ever before.\u201d",
      "The prize pot at Euro 2025 has been set at 41 million euros ($47 million), more than double the 16 million euros ($18.3 million) received by national associations in 2022.",
      "Moreover, players will receive a guaranteed share from their national associations for the first time.",
      "The men\u2019s Euro 2024 had a total prize fund of 331 million euros ($347 million), with each of the 24 teams receiving a minimum of 9.25 million euros and champion Spain earning 28.25 million euros.",
      "UEFA\u2019s aim is that Euro 2025 will act as a catalyst for further progress in the women's professional game in Switzerland and across Europe.",
      "However, Klaveness has a warning: that the richest leagues shouldn't financially separate themselves completely from the currently semi-pro ones.",
      "\u201cNow I think the next step that\u2019s really important to go further now is \u2026 not to let the head move away from the body, then we would do the same as the men\u2019s side,\u201d she said.",

      "BALTIMORE -- When Jacob deGrom is at his best, the Texas Rangers believe he's the best pitcher on the planet.",
      "The two-time Cy Young Award winner certainly is looking like his old self.",
      "DeGrom flirted with a perfect game through six innings and a no-hitter through seven Wednesday night in another dominating performance in his return from Tommy John surgery in June 2023.",
      "He threw 89 pitches, getting pulled after giving up his only hit to Colton Cowser leading off the eighth. The Rangers finished off a 7-0 win over the Baltimore Orioles as deGrom tied his career-best streak of 13 straight starts giving up two or fewer earned runs.",
      "\u201cWhen you miss that much time, you miss this a lot,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cYou got time to really think about what you've done in your career. The goal is to try to come back and be as good as I was before the surgery, so constantly trying to work on that and still working on things in between.\u201d",
      "He walked Jackson Holliday starting the seventh. Then he struck out Jordan Westburg and got Gunnar Henderson to fly out. DeGrom walked Ryan O\u2019Hearn, putting two on and causing a mound visit, then got Gary S\u00e1nchez to ground into an inning-ending forceout.",
      "Texas removed deGrom after he faced 24 batters. He had thrown 59 of 89 pitches for strikes",
      "Manager Bruce Bochy said deGrom was throwing well and he planned to give him a chance to finish a no-hit bid. The Rangers have been limiting deGrom to around 80 pitches per game.",
      "\u201cFirst guy that got a hit that was far enough,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cWe had a nice lead, and he\u2019s so fun to watch. He really is. I've said this. I'm a fan when he\u2019s pitching.\u201d",
      "Rangers catcher Jonah Heim said deGrom was throwing all four pitches for strikes, and all he had to do was call the pitches.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen him since he came over here,\" Heim said. \"So really encouraging to see really proud of him for all the work he\u2019s put in to get here.\u201d",
      "The Rangers certainly are getting the best of deGrom in his third season in Texas since of a $185 millionm five-year deal. He's off to an 8-2 start and has started 16 games after being limited to three in 2024 and six in 2023.",
      "Yes, deGrom wanted to finish off a no-hitter until a fastball wound up in the wrong spot for the only hit he allowed.",
      "\u201cIt was just fun to be out there,\u201d deGrom said.",

      "PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns have acquired center Mark Williams in a trade that sends two first-round picks to the Charlotte Hornets, a person familiar with the move told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the trade hasn\u2019t officially been announced.",
      "The Hornets received this year\u2019s No. 29 pick \u2014 which they used to select UConn guard Liam McNeeley \u2014 and a 2029 first-round selection. ESPN first reported the deal.",
      "Williams was one of two 7-footers the Suns added during the first round of the NBA draft. The Suns are also expected to get Duke center Khaman Maluach, who was selected by the Rockets with the No. 10 overall pick but is part of a trade that will send 15-time All-Star Kevin Durant to Houston.",
      "Williams averaged 15.3 points and 10.2 rebounds per game for the Hornets last year, providing plenty of production when healthy. He was the No. 15 overall pick out of Duke in the 2022 draft.",
      "The Hornets attempted to trade Williams last year to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal was later rescinded because the center failed his physical.",
      "The Lakers had agreed to send rookie Dalton Knecht and Cam Reddish along with draft considerations to get the 23-year-old Williams, a third-year pro from Duke and a former first-round draft pick. Los Angeles was looking for a big man at the time to replace Anthony Davis, who was traded to Dallas along with Max Christie for superstar Luka Doncic.",
      "Charlotte also was supposed to receive the Lakers\u2019 first-round pick in 2031 and a first-round pick swap in 2030.",
      "Instead, the Lakers nixed the trade after learning more about Williams, who has a lengthy injury history including back problems that had limited him to 84 of a possible 212 NBA games over his three seasons at that point.",
      "The Hornets sent out a statement welcoming Williams back to the team, but it created an awkward relationship.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if Williams has already taken a physical or had his medicals reviewed by Phoenix.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "LONDON -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country is pulling its support from the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the organization has \u201cignored the science\u201d and \u201clost the public trust.\u201d",
      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The U.S. has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",
      "Kennedy called on Gavi \u201cto re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion America has provided in funding since 2001,\u201d saying officials must \u201cconsider the best science available, even when that science contradicts established paradigms.\u201d Kennedy said until that happens, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute further to Gavi.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, said he and President Trump were concerned about how Gavi and the World Health Organization partnered together during the COVID-19 pandemic to work with social media companies \u201cto silence dissenting views, to stifle free speech and legitimate questions\u201d during a time when many people had questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",
      "\u201cThis ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,\u201d it said. Gavi said scientists had reviewed all available data, including any studies that raised concerns, and that the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine has \u201cplayed a key role in helping halve childhood mortality.\u201d",
      "The British government said Wednesday it would give 1.25 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) between 2026 and 2030 to Gavi. It said the money would help Gavi protect up to 500 million children in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries from diseases including meningitis, cholera and measles.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone.

Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",

      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",

      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 but so far have not caused widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure or the economy.",
      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",
      "The U.S. strikes could even prompt Iran, Russia, China and North Korea to double down on investments in cyberwarfare, according to Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor.",
      "Bellini noted that hacking operations are much cheaper than bullets, planes or nuclear arms \u2014 what defense analysts call kinetic warfare. America may be militarily dominant, he said, but its reliance on digital technology poses a vulnerability.",
      "\u201cWe just showed the world: You don\u2019t want to mess with us kinetically,\u201d said Bellini, CEO of Bellini Capital. \u201cBut we are wide open digitally. We are like Swiss cheese.\"",
      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",

      "Waymo\u2019s robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service that began earlier this year in Austin",
      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "A Japanese company says a laser navigating tool doomed its lunar lander, causing it to crash into the moon",
      "A laser navigating tool doomed a Japanese company's lunar lander earlier this month, causing it to crash into the moon.",
      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re firmly taking the next step toward our future missions,\u201d he said in Japanese.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants",
      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving cybercriminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country.",
      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

    "story": [
      "The president claimed the B-2 pilots who dropped the bombs are \"devastated.\"",
      "President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday both tried to counter a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that the attack on three Iranian nuclear facilities did limited damage by claiming news accounts of the report demeaned the B-2 pilots who dropped the bombs.",
      "Speaking at a news conference as he was set to leave the NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump claimed the pilots are \"devastated\" by the suggestion the strikes were not a complete success.",
      "He was asked several times Wednesday about the Defense Intelligence Agency's initial assessment that the bombings of the Natanz, Isfahan and Fordo facilities likely set back Iran's nuclear program by only a few months. He acknowledged the receipt of the report but noted it was incomplete.",
      "He snapped back at reporters raising questions about it, repeating his claim Iran's nuclear program was \"obliterated,\" and shifted the focus to the pilots who carried out the strike.",
      "\"You should be praising those people instead of trying to find out by getting me by trying to go and get me. You're hurting those people,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "Later Wednesday, in a Truth Social post, he said Hegseth would hold a news conference Thursday morning \"in order to fight for the Dignity of our Great American Pilots.\"",
      "\"They felt terribly! Fortunately for them and, as usual, solely for the purpose of demeaning PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP,\" he said in part. \"The News Conference will prove both interesting and irrefutable.\"",
      "The president claimed in his Netherlands news conference that he had received a call from Missouri, where the pilots are based, about the intelligence report and the news accounts about it, saying he had been told they were \"devastated, because they were trying to minimize the attack.\"",
      "\"I spoke to one of them. He said, 'Sir, we hit the site. It was perfect. It was dead on,' because they don't understand fake news,\" Trump said.",
      "The Pentagon referred questions from ABC News to the White House.",
      "Trump added about the pilots that \"they were devastated. They put their lives on the line.\"",
      "Since Saturday's attack, Trump and his officials have repeatedly praised the B-2 pilots for the mission but stepped up referencing them as part of the pushback on Wednesday. Hegseth, standing next to Trump, came to the microphone to argue news reporters and outlets \"don't care what the troops think.\"",
      "\"These pilots, these refuelers, these fighters, these air defenders, the skill and the courage it took to go into enemy territory flying 36 hours on behalf of the American people in the world to take out a nuclear program is beyond what anyone in this audience can fathom,\" Hegseth said.",
      "At the same time, Hegseth and Trump downplayed the report's initial findings about the damage.",
      "\"The report said what it said and it was fine. It was severe, they think, but they had no idea. They shouldn't have issued a report until they did, but we've got the information,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump earlier cited an Israeli intelligence report that he insisted assessed the \"strike on Fordo destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable.\"",
      "Military officials have said there is no doubt the sites sustained significant damage, but that a \"battle damage assessment\" would take time to complete, as no Western officials have been able to personally inspect the sites as of Wednesday.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement posted on X late Wednesday that \"Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed,\" and also slamming the news media. A source with knowledge of Gabbard's assessment told ABC News her description came from new U.S. intelligence.",
      "\"The propaganda media has deployed their usual tactic: selectively release portions of illegally leaked classified intelligence assessments (intentionally leaving out the fact that the assessment was written with \"low confidence\") to try to undermine President Trump's decisive leadership and the brave servicemen and women who flawlessly executed a truly historic mission to keep the American people safe and secure,\" she posted in part.",
      "Hegseth contended that the preliminary reports and images spoke for themselves.",
      "\"So, if you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel and go really deep because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated and somebody somewhere is trying to leak something to say, 'Oh, with low confidence we think maybe it's moderate,\" he claimed.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "LONDON -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country is pulling its support from the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the organization has \u201cignored the science\u201d and \u201clost the public trust.\u201d",
      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The U.S. has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",
      "Kennedy called on Gavi \u201cto re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion America has provided in funding since 2001,\u201d saying officials must \u201cconsider the best science available, even when that science contradicts established paradigms.\u201d Kennedy said until that happens, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute further to Gavi.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, said he and President Trump were concerned about how Gavi and the World Health Organization partnered together during the COVID-19 pandemic to work with social media companies \u201cto silence dissenting views, to stifle free speech and legitimate questions\u201d during a time when many people had questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",
      "\u201cThis ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,\u201d it said. Gavi said scientists had reviewed all available data, including any studies that raised concerns, and that the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine has \u201cplayed a key role in helping halve childhood mortality.\u201d",
      "The British government said Wednesday it would give 1.25 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) between 2026 and 2030 to Gavi. It said the money would help Gavi protect up to 500 million children in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries from diseases including meningitis, cholera and measles.",

      "\"Look. Vladimir Putin really has to end that war. People are dying at levels that people haven't seen for a long time.\"",
      "Then, when pressed on why he wasn't able to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine quickly as he adamantly claimed while on the campaign trail, Trump again pointed the blame towards Putin.",
      "\"It's more difficult than people wouldn't have any idea,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin has been more difficult. Frankly, I had some problems with Zelenskyy. You may have read about him, and it's been more difficult than other wars.\"",
      "Trump's public praise of Zelenskyy marks a shift in tone for the President, who has had public battles with the leader of Ukraine.",
      "Most notably in February, a public Oval Office spat between the two officials led to a scrapped bilateral mineral deal, which wasn't finalized for two months until the pair sat down together on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "Then, in recent weeks, as Trump focused on negotiating an agreement between Iran and Israel, he left last week's G7 Summit in Canada early, skipping out on a bilateral with Ukraine.",
      "However, after their meeting on Wednesday, Trump displayed more compassion for the situation in Ukraine in a moment highlighted by his exchange with a Ukrainian reporter who said her husband was a Ukrainian soldier while she and her children fled to Warsaw for safety.",
      "\"Wow, that's rough stuff, right? That's tough,\" Trump said, asking the reporter many personal questions before answering her policy question.",
      "\"That's very good question. And I wish you a lot of luck. I mean, I can see it's very upsetting to you. So say hello to your husband. Okay?\" Trump said.",

The intelligence says we don't know, it could have been very severe, that's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct, but I think we can take the 'we don't know.' It was very severe. It was obliteration.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke in support of the president's position, having accompanied Trump to The Hague.",
      "Like Trump, Hegseth (whom the president described as the \"secretary of war\") claimed what he called \"fake news\" about the Pentagon assessment as demeaning the B-2 pilots who carried out the strikes.",
      "\"These pilots these refuels\u00a0these fighters, these air\u00a0defenders, the skill and the\u00a0courage took to go into\u00a0enemy territory flying 36 hours\u00a0on behalf of the\u00a0American people in the world to\u00a0take out a nuclear program\u00a0is beyond what anyone in this\u00a0audience can fathom,\" Hegseth said, speaking next to Trump at his news conference.",
      "The defense secretary also rejected the early Pentagon analysis of the damage done by the military operation.",
      "\"Given the 30,000 pounds of explosives and capability of those munitions, it was devastation underneath Fordo,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"Any assessment that tells you it was something otherwise is speculating with other motives,\" Hegseth continued. \"And we know that because when you actually look at the report, by the way, it was a top secret report, it was preliminary, it was low confidence.\"",
      "Hegseth suggested the leak of the report had \"a political motive,\" adding, \"We're doing a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes.\"",
      "Rubio also claimed that the leak of the preliminary report was politically motivated, saying that the attacks led to \"complete and total obliteration.\"",
      "\"But all this leaker stuff, these leakers are professional stabbers,\" he said. \"They go out and they read this stuff, and then they tell you what it says against the law, but they characterize it for you in a way that's absolutely false.\"",
      "The report prompted further consternation among Trump's opponents in Washington. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons told ABC News at the NATO summit it is too soon to determine the success of U.S. strikes, adding that the recent round of fighting could have been avoided if Trump had not withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal in his first term.",
      "\"The American public needs answers for what what's really going on,\" Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. \"If what we see is Iran's nuclear program has not been obliterated, then we need to try and get Iran back to the negotiating table,\" she added.",
      "Shaheen said further nuclear tensions are also possible, as Tehran may \"be convinced their race to get a nuclear weapon is even more important -- given North Korea's example -- and they will do everything possible to get there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump said the ceasefire is \"going very well\" despite Tuesday's continued exchanges, which prompted him to lambast both Israel and Iran and to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn him off further attacks.",
      "\"Israel came back yesterday,\" he said. \"I was so proud of them, because they came back, you know, they went out because they felt it was a violation. And technically they were right, but it just wouldn't have worked out very well. And they brought the planes back.\"",
      "\"They're not going to be fighting each other,\" he added of Israel and Iran. \"They've had it. They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. You know, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes. Then it's easier to stop them.\"",
      "Trump said the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on Saturday proved decisive. \"That hit ended the war,\" he said, likening the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan at the end of World War II.",
      "\"I don't want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don't want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war,\" Trump said. \"If we didn't take that out, they would have been, they'd be fighting right now,\" he continued.",
      "The president expressed optimism about the future of U.S. and Iranian relations.",
      "\"I think we'll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,\" he said. \"I've had a relationship over the last four days. They agreed to the ceasefire, and it was a very equal agreement. They both said, that's enough. They both said it.\"",

    "summary": "Emil Bove, President Trump's former personal attorney who has been helping lead the DOJ, faced a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday to serve as a federal judge.",
    "story": [
      "Bove has been serving as principal associate deputy attorney general.",
      "Emil Bove, President Donald Trump's former defense attorney who took aggressive steps to enforce Trump's political agenda at the Justice Department in the early months of his presidency, told the Senate Judiciary Committee, \"I'm not anybody's henchman\" at a confirmation hearing Wednesday to consider him for a federal judgeship.",
      "Trump last month tapped Bove, who has been helping lead the Justice Department, for a judgeship on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees district courts in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.",
      "In his opening statement Wednesday, Bove vigorously disputed what he described as \"a wildly inaccurate caricature\" of himself generated by the \"mainstream media\" which has cast him as a \"henchman\" of President Trump.",
      "\"I am someone who tries to stand up for what I believe is right, I'm not afraid to make difficult decisions -- I understand that some of those decisions have generated controversy,\" Bove said. \"I respect this process, and I'm here today to address some of your questions about those decisions, but I want to be clear about one thing up front: There is a wildly inaccurate caricature of me in the mainstream media. I'm not anybody's henchman. I'm not an enforcer.\"",
      "The hearing came one day after a former top DOJ career official issued an explosive whistleblower complaint accusing Bove of allegedly suggesting the Trump administration should defy judicial orders that sought to restrict their aggressive efforts to deport undocumented immigrants earlier this year.",
      "The complaint -- filed by Erez Reuveni, who was fired from the department in April after he appeared in federal court in Maryland and admitted to a judge that the government had mistakenly deported accused MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador -- alleged that at a meeting on March 14, Bove said the department should consider saying \"f--- you\" to the courts and \"ignore any such court order.\"",
      "Asked by Sen. Adam Schiff about the alleged comments, Bove said, \"Senator, I have no recollection of saying anything of that kind.\"",
      "\"Did you suggest ... that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts 'f--- you' and 'ignore any such court order'?\" Schiff asked.",
      "\"I did not suggest that there would be any need to consider ignoring court orders, at the point of that meeting, there were no court orders to discuss,\" Bove replied.",
      "\"Well, did you suggest telling the courts f--- you in any matter?\" asked Schiff.",
      "\"I don't recall,\" Bove said.",
      "Schiff, joined by other Democrats on the committee, said he would issue a formal request to have the committee be provided any notes of the meetings described in the complaint that may have formally documented what Bove said.",
      "Bove said the filing of the complaint by Reuveni, a longtime career official who was promoted under the first Trump Administration for his immigration legal work, was an example of the \"unelected bureaucracy\" seeking to thwart \"the unitary executive\" and \"the people that elected the president.\"",
      "\"What I mean by that is, throughout this complaint, there's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of immigration litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be, to bind the department's leadership and other Cabinet officials,\" Bove said. \"I don't abide that line thinking in my management style, and I'm not apologetic of that.\"",
      "In an exchange with Sen. Eric Schmitt, Bove detailed how his past representation of Trump as a defense attorney helped drive his aggressive moves at the DOJ, where he fired scores of prosecutors involved in investigations of Trump and reassigned dozens more high-level career officials who worked on issues like public corruption and national security to focus on lower-level immigration offenses.",
      "\"From the perspective of a prosecutor, senator, it turned me into a person who wanted to get that building back on the right track, a track where people are, in fact, doing the right thing for the right reasons, and I think there's many, many, many people, career civil servants in the department, who are doing just that,\" Bove said. \"But I also think that there are parts of the department that have lost sight of that obligation, and I saw that in my experiences as a defense lawyer.\"",
      "\"And so what I would say is that that experience gave me, provided, equal intense focus on reform efforts to make sure that the unelected bureaucracy at the department was not in position to subvert the political will of the democratically elected president,\" he said.",
      "Democrats on the committee, meanwhile, expressed exasperation over Bove repeatedly invoking privilege to refuse to answer certain questions regarding actions he's taken in his five months helping oversee the DOJ.",
      "He refused to answer whether there was any direct involvement by White House officials such as Stephen Miller in the DOJ's decision to drop federal corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for his support on immigration enforcement. Multiple career prosecutors resigned in protest over the move but Bove rejected allegations that there was any \"quid pro quo\" deal.",
      "\"I am absolutely flabbergasted that you would come before this committee and refuse to tell us basic facts about a case that is at the core of the allegations to the appearance of impropriety that should disqualify you,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. \"You have the opportunity to clear the air, to come clean with the American people as well as this committee, and you are evading and avoiding these questions.\"",
      "Adams has denied the allegations and has pushed back on accusations of a quid quo pro.",
      "Pressed by Ranking Democratic Senate Judiciary member Sen. Dick Durbin over his move early in Trump's presidency to request a full list of FBI agents who investigated the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, Bove argued the request was based on an effort to identify any personnel who may have engaged in wrongdoing -- not to target them for investigating the attack itself.",
      "\"I did and continue to condemn unlawful behavior, particularly violence against law enforcement,\" Bove said. \"At the same time, I condemn heavy handed and unnecessary tactics by prosecutors and agents. Both of those things I submit are characteristic of these events.\"",
      "Bove also said he stood by statements in an article for Law360 in 2022 in which he described the Capitol attack as \"domestic terrorism\" and argued there wasn't any inconsistency between that belief and his firings of multiple Jan. 6 prosecutors at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office in his opening weeks at the Justice Department.",
      "Durbin, in his opening remarks at Wednesday's hearing, said, \"The former personal defense attorney of President Trump, Mr. Bove has led the effort to weaponize the Department of Justice against the president's enemies. Having earned his stripes as a loyalist to this President, he's been rewarded with this lifetime nomination.\"",
      "Republican Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley cast Bove as a victim of an \"intense opposition campaign\" by Democrats and the media.",
      "\"I think that this committee owes this nominee a fair shake and respect at this hearing,\" Grassley said. \"This is hardly the first time this Congress that we've come into a nomination hearing against a backdrop of breathless claims that one of President Trump's nominees is uniquely unqualified or unfit.\"",
      "Grassley argued that lawmakers should instead look to Bove's resume as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and his time as a judicial clerk on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, prior to serving as Trump's personal attorney.",
      "\"This high stakes worked demands sharp legal judgment and steady resolve,\" Grassley said. \"Day in and day out, he was in the trenches putting terrorists and drug traffickers behind bars ... Put very simply, Mr. Bove checks every box -- academic distinction, federal courtships, complex trial and appellate litigation, senior Justice Department leadership. His experience isn't just sufficient, it is very exceptional.\"",
      "It's not immediately clear when Bove's nomination will be formally voted out of the committee or when his confirmation vote will be scheduled by the Senate.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has hired an anti-vaccine advocate and longtime ally to a position at the Health and Human Services Department, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Lyn Redwood served for years as president of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization founded by Kennedy. Her exact role at HHS is unclear.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a department spokesman, declined to comment.",
      "Meanwhile, Redwood is expected to deliver a presentation at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting on Thursday using a report on thimerosal that is currently available online, which contains misleading information and cites a source that apparently does not exist, according to one author, who told ABC News he is falsely cited in the report.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative in vaccines meant to prevent contamination. It's currently used in about 4% of flu shots but was removed from routine childhood vaccines in 2001.",
      "\"To the best of my knowledge, the study in rats referred to in the planned CDC presentation by Lyn Redwood listing Berman RF as first author does not exist,\" Robert F Berman, Ph.D., professor emeritus at the University of California Davis, said.",
      "\"I have not published a paper with that title or with that set of co-authors in the journal Neurotoxicology in 2008. Also, none of my research has made any statements about possible thimerosal effects on microglia in the brain or resulting in neuroimmune effects,\" Berman said.",
      "That citation has since been removed from the revised presentation online.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report Redwood's appointment to HHS.",
      "Redwood has held a longstanding belief that mercury exposure through thimerosal-containing vaccines causes autism. Specifically, she has directly attributed her son's autism to mercury exposure from childhood vaccines as recently as October 2024 in a podcast with RFK Jr.",
      "Decades of research has found no link between autism and vaccines or any vaccine preservative, including thimerosal.",
      "\"Thimerosal was removed from all routine childhood vaccines in the US out of an abundance of caution - it is still used as a preservative in much of the world. Many studies have demonstrated that it is safe and has no association with neurodevelopmental disorders,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases and AAP's liaison to ACIP, told ABC News.",
      "A thorough report of existing evidence by the Institute of Medicine in 2004 concluded, \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\"",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also says, \"research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism.\"",
      "While this preservative is not used frequently in the U.S., if it is removed or no longer recommended in those remaining flu shots, doctors worry it could lead to unnecessary gaps in vaccine access and the potential for harm by not protecting these people.",
      "\"Any decrease in the number of flu vaccines available will likely result in fewer people being vaccinated and subsequently, more hospitalizations and deaths. Its removal could also signal to the general public unwarranted safety concerns,\" O'Leary said.",
      "At least one vaccine expert said she shuddered Wednesday at the idea of Redwood joining HHS.",
      "Fiona Havers, a 13-year CDC veteran who worked on vaccine policy, told ABC News in a statement, \u201cLyn Redwood is well-known for spreading vaccine misinformation. It is troubling that Redwood may now have an official role within HHS and will potentially be in a position to interfere with official messaging about vaccine safety.\u201d",
      "ABC News has reached out to Redwood for a comment.",
      "Redwood and Kennedy have long been close. In a conversation between the two of them on Kennedy\u2019s podcast last year, Kennedy credited Redwood with being the figure who \u201ccoordinated\u201d the \u201cstalking crusade\u201d by mothers who convinced Kennedy to begin looking into the potential harms of vaccines in the early 2000s.",
      "Redwood was also involved in Kennedy\u2019s recent presidential campaign, coordinating volunteer and petition-gathering trainings in Georgia, her home state, according to sign-up pages on the campaign\u2019s website.",

The U.S. has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",

      "A former Venezuelan spymaster who was close to the country\u2019s late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has pleaded guilty to narco-terrorist charges",
      "MIAMI -- A former Venezuelan spymaster who was close to the country\u2019s late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez pleaded guilty Wednesday to drug trafficking charges a week before his trial was set to begin in a Manhattan federal court.",
      "Retired Maj. Gen. Hugo Carvajal was extradited from Spain in 2023 after more than a decade on the run from U.S. law enforcement, including included a botched arrest in Aruba while he was serving as a diplomat representing current Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Carvajal pleaded guilty in court to all four criminal counts, including narco-terrorism, in an indictment accusing him of leading a cartel made up of senior Venezuelan military officers that attempted to \u201cflood\u201d the U.S. with cocaine in cahoots with leftist guerrillas from neighboring Colombia.",
      "In a letter this week to defense counsel, prosecutors said they believe federal sentencing guidelines call for Carvajal to serve a mandatory minimum of 50 years in prison to a maximum of life.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cEl Pollo,\u201d Spanish for \u201cthe chicken,\u201d Carvajal advised Ch\u00e1vez for more than a decade. He later broke with Marudo, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s handpicked successor, and threw his support behind the U.S.-backed political opposition \u2014 in dramatic fashion.",
      "In a recording made from an undisclosed location, Carvajal called on his former military cohorts to rebel against a month into mass protests seeking to replace Maduro with lawmaker Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom the first Trump administration recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader as head of the democratically elected National Assembly.",
      "The hoped-for barracks revolt never materialized, and Carvajal fled to Spain. In 2021 he was captured hiding out in a Madrid apartment after he defied a Spanish extradition order and disappeared.",
      "Carvajal's straight-up guilty plea, without any promise of leniency, could be part of a gamble to win credit down the line for cooperating with U.S. efforts against a top foreign adversary that sits atop the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "Although Carvajal has been out of power for years, his backers say he can provide potentially valuable insights on the inner workings of the spread of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua into the U.S. and spying activities of the Maduro-allied governments of Cuba, Russia, China and Iran.",
      "He may also be angling for Trump's attention with information about voting technology company Smartmatic. One of Carvajal\u2019s deputies was a major player in Venezuela\u2019s electoral authority when the company was getting off the ground.",
      "Florida-based Smartmatic says its global business was decimated when Fox News aired false claims by Trump allies that it helped rig the 2020 U.S. election. One of the company's Venezuelan founders was later charged in the U.S. in a bribery case involving its work in the Philippines.",
      "Gary Berntsen, a former CIA officer in Latin America who oversaw commandos that hunted al-Qaida, sent a public letter this week to Trump urging the Justice Department to delay the start of Carvajal's trial so officials can debrief the former spymaster.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s no angel, he\u2019s a very bad man,\u201d Berntsen said in an interview. \u201cBut we need to defend democracy.\u201d",
      "Carvajal's attorney, Robert Feitel, said prosecutors announced in court this month that they never extended a plea offer to his client or sought to meet with him.",
      "\u201cI think that was an enormous mistake,\u201d Feitel told The Associated Press while declining further comment. \u201cHe has information that is extraordinarily important to our national security and law enforcement.\u201d",
      "In 2011, prosecutors alleged that Carvajal used his office to coordinate the smuggling of approximately 5,600 kilograms (12,300 pounds) of cocaine aboard a jet from Venezuela to Mexico in 2006. In exchange he accepted millions of dollars from drug traffickers, prosecutors said.",
      "He allegedly arranged the shipment as one of the leaders of the so-called Cartel of the Suns \u2014 a nod to the sun insignias affixed to the uniforms of senior Venezuelan military officers. The cocaine was sourced by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization and which for years took refuge in Venezuela as it sought to overthrow Colombia's government.",
      "Carvajal \u201cexploited his position as the director of Venezuela\u2019s military intelligence and abandoned his responsibility to the people of Venezuela in order to intentionally cause harm to the United States,\u201d DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy said. \u201cAfter years of trying to evade law enforcement, (he) will now likely spend the rest of his life in federal prison.\u201d",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- A Philadelphia jury on Wednesday convicted a suburban man of killing a Temple University police officer who had chased him down as a suspect in a series of carjackings.",
      "That Miles Pfeffer killed Officer Christopher Fitzgerald had not been in dispute. The murder trial largely centered on whether the February 2023 shooting death was intentional.",
      "After less than a half-hour of deliberations, jurors found him guilty of first-degree murder, murder of a law enforcement officer, gun crimes and other offenses.",

Two of the teenagers hid. Fitzgerald caught up with Pfeffer and ordered him to the ground, leading to a struggle, authorities said.",
      "Pfeffer then pulled out a gun and shot Fitzgerald six times, sometimes at point-blank range, prosecutors said. A security camera video played in court for jurors showed some of the chase and shooting. Pfeffer's brother testified against him at trial.",

      "The family of a Nevada inmate who died in custody in December 2023 is disputing the official account of his death",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The family of a Nevada inmate who died in custody after he was pepper-sprayed, shackled and restrained is disputing the official account of his death in a coroner's report while also accusing prison staff of excessive force and destroying video evidence.",
      "A lawsuit filed this week in Clark County District Court says Patrick Odale wasn't acting erratically and \u201cgrowling\u201d at officers, as the coroner's report states, but was suffering from an asthma attack when he approached prison guards in December 2023 at Southern Desert Correctional Center, a mostly medium-security facility near Las Vegas.",
      "Instead of helping Odale, the lawsuit alleges, officers pepper-sprayed and beat him and restrained him with his face to the ground. The 39-year-old was pronounced dead soon after.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the Nevada Department of Corrections and its director, the prison warden, correctional officers and other prison staff engaged in a broad conspiracy that it says sought to cover up the extent of Odale's injuries and the officers' use of force.",
      "\u201cPatrick endured a prolonged and painful death,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "It also names the Clark County coroner's office and the medical examiner who performed Odale\u2019s autopsy, saying the autopsy report downplayed Odale's injuries while overstating the role that drugs found in his system played in his death, which was ruled a homicide.",
      "Both the county and the state Department of Corrections said Wednesday they can't comment on pending litigation.",
      "The coroner's report, which was finalized in August 2024, said Odale died of \u201c positional and mechanical asphyxia in the setting of law enforcement restraint.\" But it also said he had low levels of methamphetamine and an animal sedative in his system, and that the drugs were a \u201cmajor contributor\u201d in his death.",
      "The lawsuit raises questions about the medical examiner's decision to list the drugs as contributing to his death, but not Odale's other injuries.",
      "Autopsy photos included in the lawsuit show purple bruises across Odale's shoulders and upper back, as well as on his wrists, arms and lips. The coroner's report describes the injuries as \u201cminor blunt force trauma,\" while the lawsuit says they were \u201ccritical injuries.\u201d",
      "Odale, a father of two, was sentenced in early 2023 to up to two years in prison for possessing a stolen credit card and attempting to carry a concealed weapon, court records show. He died weeks before he was set to be released from custody.",
      "\u201cWe were counting down the days. Instead of welcoming him home, we mourned his death and had no chance to say goodbye,\u201d his 15-year-old daughter said in a statement provided by Return Strong, a group advocating for people who are incarcerated.",
      "According to the coroner's report, officers said Odale was \u201cerratic and growling\u201d at them on the night of his death, leading them to pepper-spray him and put him in a storage room with yard tools for several minutes until he began \u201cthrashing the room.\" Then officers pulled him to the ground, restrained him and took him to the prison infirmary, the report says.",
      "But the lawsuit claims that other inmates who witnessed the incident reported hearing Odale begging for medical staff and saying he couldn't breathe. The inmates, according to the lawsuit, also reported seeing guards smash Odale's head into a steel door frame after pulling him out of the storage room.",
      "Some of the altercation was captured on security video, the coroner's report shows, but it also indicates that there may be a gap in the footage.",
      "The footage, as described by the autopsy report, shows Odale groaning as he is taken to the infirmary. He is face-down with his hands shackled behind his back. Then, the autopsy says, \u201cafter a gap, video coverage resumes,\u201d showing prison staff performing CPR on an unresponsive Odale.",
      "The corrections department has not released any of the video to Odale's family or the law firm representing them, said James Urrutia, their lawyer.",
      "Urrutia is also representing the family of another inmate, Christian Walker, who died after he was beaten by guards at High Desert State Prison near Las Vegas. Their ongoing lawsuit disputes the coroner's report in that case and accuses prison staff of trying to cover up the death.",
      "Walker\u2019s face was swollen and smeared with blood when he died in custody in April 2023, according to an unredacted copy of his autopsy obtained by the AP. He also suffered head trauma and other injuries to his torso, neck and extremities.",
      "The medical examiner in Walker's case concluded it was a natural death caused by heart problems.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions Wednesday on three Mexico-based financial institutions it said were used to launder millions of dollars for cartels, in a move officials say would block certain money transfers between the sanctioned banks and U.S. banks.",
      "The orders issued on the banks CIBanco and Intercam Banco, as well as brokerage Vector Casa de Bolsa, are part of an ongoing push by U.S. and Mexican authorities under pressure by U.S. President Donald Trump to crack down on Mexican cartels that traffic fentanyl.",
      "The banks \u201chave collectively played a long-standing and vital role in laundering millions of dollars on behalf of Mexico-based cartels and facilitating payments for the procurement of precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Faulkender said the measures would \u201ceffectively cut off\u201d the bank branches from doing business with U.S. financial institutions. The orders would also sanction 31 people connected to the banks.",
      "The three financial institutions did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear, however, how far-reaching the effects would actually be.",
      "When asked by reporters, Treasury officials did not confirm nor provide details about specific transfers between the Mexico-based banks and U.S. banks, but said there were \u201ctouch points\u201d between the institutions. Officials also did not rule out the possibility of foreign branches of the banks outside of Mexico being able to continue to do business with U.S. banks.",
      "According to the Treasury orders, CIBanco helped facilitate money laundering for a number of cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation, Beltran Leyva and Gulf. Officials said the bank \u201cfacilitated procurement\u201d of chemicals used to make fentanyl from China, by processing over $2.1 million in payments for the materials.",
      "Vector was accused of facilitating money laundering for the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, including $1 million in payments for fentanyl chemicals. The Treasury officials also said that Vector was used by the Sinaloa Cartel to send bribes to former Mexican Security Secretary Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, who was sentenced to more than 38 years in prison by a New York court in October for the charges. They estimated that transactions exceeded $40 million.",
      "Intercam faced similar charges, and was accused of passing through transfers of $1.5 million in payments for chemicals used to produce fentanyl from China.",

      "This year, the administration also declared many of those cartels Foreign Terrorist Organizations and has sanctioned a number of Mexican officials.",

      "Former Arizona newscaster Kari Lake, picked by President Donald Trump to manage Voice of America and the agency overseeing it, told a congressional committee that they were rotten to the core and should be scrapped",
      "The Trump administration's choice to oversee government-run news outlets like Voice of America told a congressional committee on Wednesday that \u201cit's best to just scrap the whole thing and start over.\u201d",
      "Kari Lake, the former Arizona newscaster turned Republican politician, testified that the U.S. Agency for Global Media is \u201crotten to the core\u201d and that any salvageable parts should be put under the control of the U.S. State Department.",
      "Lake appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee days after layoff notices were sent to hundreds of employees at the agency and Voice of America, cutting its staff by 85%. With politicians speaking over and around each other, the hearing amounted to a debate on what role journalism should have in spreading American influence abroad.",
      "Lake said she is following President Donald Trump's directive to cut the dozens of outlets to the core, with most already shut down or sharply curtailed. She characterized many broadcasts as anti-American or promoting liberal bias, pointing to efforts by Chinese government representatives in the U.S. to influence Mandarin-language content on Radio Free Asia.",
      "The agency is investigating threatening phone calls to a member of Congress from inside Voice of America, Lake said, hinting \u2014 but not saying outright \u2014 that the target was a Republican.",
      "Trump backed her up via a Truth Social post on Wednesday: \u201cWhy would a Republican want Democrat \u2018mouthpiece\u2019 Voice of America (VOA) to continue? It's a TOTAL, LEFTWING DISASTER \u2014 No Republican should vote for its survival. KILL IT!\u201d",
      "A congressionally-mandated firewall \u201cmakes it impossible for agency management to prevent biased, anti-American or rogue reporting,\u201d Lake said. The \u201cfirewall\u201d she refers to has been in place since 1994, prohibiting any interference by a U.S. government official in the independent reporting of news.",
      "Since Voice of America's inception in World War II, the outlets have operated under the theory that objective news reports delivered to citizens whose own governments resist such freedoms is a \u201csoft power\u201d way to promote the nation's interests.",
      "\u201cI feel like I am suffering through a propaganda war through your testimony,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat. \u201cFor those of you who think this is about reform, it's not. It's about shutting down media.\u201d",
      "Democrats pointed to reports about Russia and China stepping up their own media efforts to fill the void left by stilled American voices. \u201cReliable news is no longer accessible for millions of people around the world,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo, a Rhode Island Democrat. \u201cIf our adversaries are cheering this decision, why would we do that?\u201d",
      "Employees at Radio Farda, a Persian-language branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that broadcasts in Iran, were hurriedly called back into work at the outset of the Israel-Iran war, only for most of them to be laid off less than a week later.",
      "Democrats characterized that as a missed opportunity to speak to Iranian citizens at a time when their government was weak. But Lake said a few employees were able to translate Trump's speech announcing the U.S. bombing on Saturday into Farsi for the radio outlet.",
      "\u201cWe don't need to have massive newsrooms,\u201d Lake said. U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, said that \u201ca lot of journalists are freelance. That's something we should look into.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats personally attacked Lake as unreliable, particularly a fellow Arizona resident, Rep. Greg Stanton, who pointed to false statements Lake had made about her own failed bids to get elected as governor and senator of that state.",
      "\u201cThe American people cannot believe a word you say,\u201d Stanton said. Lake said Stanton was spouting \u201ccomplete insanity.\u201d \u201cI wish I could yield back the last five minutes of my life,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, several Republicans saluted Lake for trying to reform the agencies.",

      "Banks seeking to make mortgages that qualify for purchase by Fannie and Freddie have not typically considered a borrower\u2019s crypto holdings until they were sold, or converted, to dollars.",

      "The agencies have to come up with their proposals \u201cas soon as reasonably practical,\u201d according to the order.",
      "Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since the Great Recession, buy mortgages that meet their risk criteria from banks, which helps provide liquidity for the housing market.

      "Oregon lawmakers have voted to repeal the state's contested wildfire hazard map",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Oregon lawmakers have voted to repeal the state's contentous wildfire hazard map, which subjected homeowners in certain areas at high risk of wildfires to stricter building codes and requirements to reduce vegetation on their properties.",
      "The measure passed the state House with just one vote against Tuesday, after passing the state Senate unanimously in April. Republicans had called for the map's repeal throughout the legislative session and accused Democrats of stalling it. The bill now heads to Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek.",
      "\u201cDespite an incredibly frustrating political process, we appreciate the members who have chosen to do the right thing in repealing these maps,\" Republican House Minority Leader Christine Drazan said.",
      "She added in her statement that the maps had created \u201cchaos\u201d in rural areas.",
      "An updated version of the state-developed maps released earlier this year created new rules for those living in the most fire-prone areas that also border wildlands such as forests or grasslands. The building and so-called defensible space provisions impacted 6% of the state\u2019s roughly 1.9 million tax lots, a reduction from an earlier version developed in 2022 but retracted after homeowners raised concerns that it would increase insurance premiums.",
      "The building codes were set to require new construction in high hazard areas in the so-called wildland-urban interface to have fire-resistant features, and to apply to existing homes if certain upgrades were made.",
      "The bill passed by the Legislature revokes those defensible space and building code requirements, instead directing state agencies to create model codes that local governments can choose to adopt.",
      "The two maps showing wildfire hazard levels and the wildland-urban interface were released by the Oregon Department of Forestry and developed by Oregon State University scientists.",
      "Under a state law passed in 2023, insurers cannot use a wildfire hazard map produced by a state agency to cancel or decline to renew a homeowner insurance policy, or to increase premiums. But many who opposed the maps said they were flawed and placed burdens on homeowners.",
      "Experts who worked on the maps said they were an important step in identifying and protecting fire-prone areas as the state continues to contend with record-breaking wildfires. Oregon's wildfire season last year was a record in terms of cost and acres burned, and wind-fueled blazes over Labor Day weekend in 2020 killed nine people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "California, Arizona and New Mexico have had wildfire hazard maps for years. Last year, lawmakers in Washington state ordered the creation of a statewide wildfire risk map, and in 2023, Colorado passed a law establishing a wildfire resiliency code board.",

      "NEW YORK -- The stunning success of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, in the race for New York City mayor has exposed anew the fiery divisions plaguing the Democratic Party as it struggles to repair its brand nearly half a year into Donald Trump's presidency.",
      "A fresh round of infighting erupted among Democratic officials, donors and political operatives on Wednesday, a day after Mamdani\u2019s leading opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded the Democratic primary. Mamdani appears on a glide path to the nomination, though ranked choice vote counting will determine the final outcome next week.",
      "Many progressives cheered the emergence of the young and charismatic Mamdani, whose candidacy caught on with viral campaign videos and a focus on the cost of living. But the party\u2019s more pragmatic wing cast the outcome as a serious setback in their quest to broaden Democrats' appeal and move past the more controversial policies that alienated would-be voters in recent elections.",
      "Indeed, Wednesday's debate was about much more than who would lead America's largest city for the next four years.",
      "Giddy Republicans viewed Mamdani's success as a political gift that would help shape elections across New Jersey and Virginia this fall and into next year's midterms. And while such predictions are premature, national conservative media focused on the New York election with fresh zeal, suggesting that Mamdani's emerging profile as a prominent Democratic leader will surely grow.",
      "Trump took aim at Mamdani on social media, calling him \u201ca 100% Communist Lunatic.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\" the president wrote. \u201cYes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats think so, too.",
      "Lawrence Summers, the Treasury Secretary under former Democratic President Barack Obama, aired dire concerns on social media.",
      "\u201cI am profoundly alarmed about the future of the (Democratic Party) and the country\" because of the New York City results, Summers wrote.",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who had endorsed Mamdani, scoffed at such Democratic critics and instead called for them to follow Mamdani's lead.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Mamdani's campaign really shows the direction in which the Democratic Party should be moving. And that is not to worry about what billionaires want, but to worry about what working-class people want,\" Sanders told The Associated Press.",
      "The Vermont senator warned Republicans against premature celebration.",
      "\u201cPeople like Mamdani are their worst nightmares,\" Sanders said of the GOP. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the Democrats to be strongly against Donald Trump. It is another thing to give working class people something to vote for \u2014 a positive agenda.\"",
      "Assuming Mamdani ultimately is the Democratic nominee, he would move to a November election against embattled Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and maybe even Cuomo again, should he also choose to run as an independent.",
      "A member of the New York state Legislature since 2021, Mamdani won over Democratic primary voters with an optimistic message centered on the cost-of-living backed by a sprawling grassroots campaign that brought out thousands of volunteers across the city's five boroughs. Initial precinct data shows that he did well in the city's wealthier enclaves while Cuomo struggled in all but majority Black and orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, along with the more conservative Staten Island.",
      "Mamdani's rise was aided by Cuomo's baggage. The 67-year-old Democrat was trying to mount a political comeback from a sexual harassment scandal that forced him to resign the governorship in 2021.",
      "Mamdani has had to sidestep a field of landmines of his own making, centered on his policies and political rhetoric.",
      "He called the New York Police Department \u201cracist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety\u201d in a 2020 social media post. As a mayoral candidate, he softened his stance and said that the police served a vital role. Still, he pushed for the creation of a new public safety department that would rely more on mental health care services and outreach workers.",
      "On Israel's war in Gaza, he used the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe Israel\u2019s actions in the conflict. In the primary's closing stretch, Mamdani also defended the phrase \u201c globalize the intifada,\u201d which he described as \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.\u201d",
      "He also faced criticism over his identity as a democratic socialist, a label he refused to back away from.",
      "Mamdani's agenda includes free city bus service, free child care, government-run grocery stores, a rent freeze for people living in rent-regulated apartments and new affordable housing \u2014 all paid for by raising taxes on the rich.",
      "Matt Bennett, co-founder of the centrist Democratic group Third Way, warned that Mamdani\u2019s policies are a political problem for the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Mamdani is young, charismatic, a great communicator \u2014 all of those things are to be emulated,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHis ideas are bad. ... And his affiliation with the (Democratic Socialists of America) is very dangerous. It\u2019s already being weaponized by the Republicans.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's age and ethnic background also earned praise from allies across the country. He would be the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century and its first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected.",
      "After keeping quiet on Mamdani throughout his primary campaign, three of New York\u2019s top Democrats, Gov. Kathy Hochul, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, praised the progressive upstart but stopped short of endorsing him after his victory seemed assured.",
      "The Democratic leaders, largely considered moderates, applauded his focus on affordability and said they had spoken with him, although none explicitly said they would support him in the November general election.",
      "Mamdani's Democratic critics feared that he would make their task this fall and in next year's midterm elections, which will decide the balance of power in Congress, even more difficult.",
      "The group, Republicans Against Trumpism, a key Democratic ally in the 2024 election, predicted that Republicans would make Mamdani \u201cthe face of the Democratic Party, hurting moderates in swing districts and Democrats\u2019 chances of taking back the House.\u201d",
      "In a Wednesday radio interview with WNYC, Mamdani acknowledged that his contest had become part of the national debate.",
      "\u201cIt has been tempting I think for some to claim as if the party has gone too left,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen in fact what has occurred for far too long is the abandonment of the same working-class voters who then abandoned this party.\"",

      "A man accused of hurling Molotov cocktails at a group of people demonstrating in Boulder, Colorado, in support of Israeli hostages has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 hate crime counts",
      "DENVER -- A man accused of hurling Molotov cocktails at a group of people demonstrating in Boulder, Colorado, in support of Israeli hostages has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 hate crime counts.",
      "Soliman was initially charged with only one hate crime count in federal court in the June 1 attack on demonstrators. The federal grand jury indictment, which was filed in court Tuesday, had been expected for weeks as a formality in advancing the felony criminal case toward trial. It is routine for prosecutors to add charges beyond the crimes alleged in an initial criminal complaint.",
      "The indictment accuses Soliman of trying to kill eight people who were hurt by the Molotov cocktails and targeting them because of their perceived or actual national origin, which prosecutors say was their perceived or actual connection and support for Israel. He was also indicted for another hate crime for trying to kill the others at the event or nearby who were not injured.",
      "Soliman was also charged with two counts of using a fire and explosive to commit a felony and one count of possessing an explosive device while committing a felony, which are also considered to be hate crimes.",
      "Investigators say Soliman told them he had intended to kill the roughly 20 participants at the weekly demonstration on Boulder\u2019s Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but threw just two of his over two dozen Molotov cocktails while yelling \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Soliman, who is also being prosecuted in state court for attempted murder and other charges, told investigators he tried to buy a gun but was not able to because he was not a \u201clegal citizen.\u201d",
      "He posed as a gardener, wearing a construction vest, to get close to the group before launching the attack, according to court documents.",
      "Federal authorities say Soliman, an Egyptian national, has been living in the U.S. illegally with his family.",
      "Soliman is being represented in state and federal court by public defenders who do not comment on their cases to the media.",
      "At a hearing last week, Soliman\u2019s defense attorney, David Kraut, urged Magistrate Judge Kathryn Starnella not to allow the case to move forward because he said the alleged attack was not a hate crime. Instead, he said it was motivated by opposition to the political movement of Zionism. An attack motivated by someone\u2019s political views is not considered a hate crime under federal law.",
      "Soliman is scheduled to appear in federal court on Friday for a hearing in which he may be asked to enter a plea to the charges.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Now comes a new chapter in U.S.-Iran relations, whether for the better or the even worse.",
      "For nearly a half century, the world has witnessed an enmity for the ages \u2014 the threats, the plotting, the poisonous rhetoric between the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d of Iranian lore and the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d troublemaker of the Middle East, in America's eyes.",
      "Now we have a U.S. president saying, of all things, \u201cGod bless Iran.\u201d",
      "This change of tone, however fleeting, came after the intense U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear-development sites this week, Iran's retaliatory yet restrained attack on a U.S. military base in Qatar and the tentative ceasefire brokered by President Donald Trump in the Israel-Iran war.",
      "The U.S. attack on three targets inflicted serious damage but did not destroy them, a U.S. intelligence report found, contradicting Trump's assertion that the attack \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Here are some questions and answers about the long history of bad blood between the two countries:",
      "In the first blush of a ceasefire agreement, even before Israel and Iran appeared to be fully on board, Trump exulted in the achievement. \u201cGod bless Israel,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201cGod bless Iran.\u201d He wished blessings on the Middle East, America and the world, too.",
      "When it became clear that all hostilities had not immediately ceased after all, he took to swearing instead.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f\u2014 they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said on camera.",
      "In that moment, Trump was especially critical of Israel, the steadfast U.S. ally, for seeming less attached to the pause in fighting than the country that has been shouting \u201cDeath to America\u201d for generations and is accused of trying to assassinate him.",
      "In two words, Operation Ajax.",
      "That was the 1953 coup orchestrated by the CIA, with British support, that overthrew Iran's democratically elected government and handed power to the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Western powers had feared the rise of Soviet influence and the nationalization of Iran's oil industry.",
      "The shah was a strategic U.S. ally who repaired official relations with Washington. But grievances simmered among Iranians over his autocratic rule and his bowing to America's interests.",
      "All of that boiled over in 1979 when the shah fled the country and the theocratic revolutionaries took control, imposing their own hard line.",
      "Profoundly.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1979, with anti-American sentiment at a fever pitch, Iranian students took 66 American diplomats and citizens hostage and held more than 50 of them in captivity for 444 days.",
      "It was a humiliating spectacle for the United States and President Jimmy Carter, who ordered a secret rescue mission months into the Iran hostage crisis. In Operation Eagle Claw, eight Navy helicopters and six Air Force transport planes were sent to rendezvous in the Iranian desert. A sand storm aborted the mission and eight service members died when a helicopter crashed into a C-120 refueling plane.",
      "Diplomatic ties were severed in 1980 and remain broken.",
      "Iran released the hostages minutes after Ronald Reagan's presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981. That was just long enough to ensure that Carter, bogged in the crisis for over a year, would not see them freed in his term.",
      "No. But the last big one was at sea.",
      "On April 18, 1988, the U.S. Navy sank two Iranian ships, damaged another and destroyed two surveillance platforms in its largest surface engagement since World War II. Operation Praying Mantis was in retaliation against the mining of the USS Samuel B. Roberts in the Persian Gulf four days earlier. Ten sailors were injured and the explosion left a gaping hole in the hull.",
      "Not officially, but essentially.",
      "The U.S. provided economic aid, intelligence sharing and military-adjacent technology to Iraq, concerned that an Iranian victory would spread instability through the region and strain oil supplies. Iran and Iraq emerged from the 1980-1988 war with no clear victor and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, while U.S.-Iraq relations fractured spectacularly in the years after.",
      "An example of U.S.-Iran cooperation of sorts \u2014 an illegal, and secret, one until it wasn't.",
      "Not long after the U.S. designated Iran a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984 \u2014 a status that remains \u2014 it emerged that America was illicitly selling arms to Iran. One purpose was to win the release of hostages in Lebanon under the control of Iran-backed Hezbollah. The other was to raise secret money for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in defiance of a U.S. ban on supporting them.",
      "President Ronald Reagan fumbled his way through the scandal but emerged unscathed \u2014 legally if not reputationally.",
      "Only four: Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Syria.",
      "The designation makes those countries the target of broad sanctions. Syria's designation is being reviewed in light of the fall of Bashar Assad\u2019s government.",
      "From President George W. Bush in his 2002 State of the Union address. He spoke five months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the year before he launched the invasion of Iraq on the wrong premise that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.",
      "He singled out Iran, North Korea and Saddam's Iraq and said: \u201cStates like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\u201d",
      "In response, Iran and some of its anti-American proxies and allies in the region took to calling their informal coalition an Axis of Resistance at times.",
      "Some, like Hezbollah and Hamas, are degraded due to Israel's fierce and sustained assault on them. In Syria, Assad fled to safety in Moscow after losing power to rebels once tied to al-Qaida but now cautiously welcomed by Trump.",
      "In Yemen, Houthi rebels who have attacked commercial ships in the Red Sea and pledged common cause with Palestinians have been bombed by the U.S. and Britain. In Iraq, armed Shia factions controlled or supported by Iran still operate and attract periodic attacks from the United States.",
      "In 2015, President Barack Obama and other powers struck a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear development in return for the easing of sanctions. Iran agreed to get rid of an enriched uranium stockpile, dismantle most centrifuges and give international inspectors more access to see what it was doing.",
      "Trump assailed the deal in his 2016 campaign and scrapped it two years later as president, imposing a \"maximum pressure\" campaign of sanctions. He argued the deal only delayed the development of nuclear weapons and did nothing to restrain Iran's aggression in the region. Iran's nuclear program resumed over time and, according to inspectors, accelerated in recent months.",
      "Trump's exit from the nuclear deal brought a warning from Hassan Rouhani, then Iran's president, in 2018: \u201cAmerica must understand well that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace. And war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\u201d",
      "In January 2020, Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top commander, when he was in Iraq.",
      "Then Iran came after him, according to President Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland. Days after Trump won last year's election, the Justice Department filed charges against an Iranian man believed to still be in his country and two alleged associates in New York.",
      "\u201cThe Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran\u2019s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump,\" Garland said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration said Wednesday that California must change its policies allowing transgender girls to compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education said it determined California's education department and governing body for high school sports are violating Title IX, a federal law banning sex discrimination in education. The federal government said California must agree to change its policies in 10 days or \u201crisk imminent enforcement action.\" The administration could otherwise refer the state to the U.S. Justice Department, the Education Department said.",
      "California, though, said it has no plans to change its policies.",
      "\u201cThe California Department of Education believes all students should have the opportunity to learn and play at school, and we have consistently applied existing law in support of students\u2019 rights to do so,\u201d agency spokesperson Liz Sanders said in a statement.",

      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will relentlessly enforce Title IX protections for women and girls, and our findings today make clear that California has failed to adhere to its obligations under federal law,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "She told Fox News the agency may pull federal funding if the state does not comply. The Education Department said the state should apologize and restore awards to girls who lost sports titles to trans athletes, and notify school sports programs that receive federal funding that Title IX prohibits trans girls from participating in girls sports.",
      "The announcement comes weeks after a trans student athlete garnered national attention over her participation in the California high school state track and field championship. The student, AB Hernandez, placed first in the girls high jump and triple jump, and second in the long jump. The California Interscholastic Federation, which ran the meet, awarded gold and silver medals to both Hernandez and other competitors who would have placed had she not participated. It was the first time the federation made such a rule change.",
      "The issue is part of a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have limited transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. At least two dozen states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.",
      "Former California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law in 2013 allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity.",
      "Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon said McMahon\u2019s threat to pull federal funding over the state\u2019s policy was \u201cdramatic, fake, and completely divorced from reality.\u201d",
      "The California Interscholastic Federation declined to respond to the announcement, saying it does not comment on legal matters.",
      "The federation is violating the U.S. Constitution by allowing trans girls to compete in sex-segregated sports consistent with their gender identity, said Harmeet Dhillon, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights, in a letter after the state track and field finals.",
      "The California Family Council, a conservative group that opposes trans girls' competition in girls sports, applauded the federal government's findings Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a critical step toward restoring fairness and protecting the integrity of girls\u2019 sports in our state,\" Sophia Lorey, an advocate for the group, said in a statement.",

The sheer size of the bear required a member of the zoo's trained armed response team to be present in the room \u2014 a gun within arm's reach \u2014 in case the animal awoke during the procedure, Routley said. But the procedure went without a hitch, and Tundra is now back in his habitat, behaving and eating normally.",
      "Other veterinary teams have not always been as lucky. In 2009, a zoo veterinarian at Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha, Nebraska, suffered severe injuries to his arm while performing a routine medical exam on a 200-pound (90 kilogram) Malaysian tiger.",
      "The tiger was coming out of sedation when the vet inadvertently brushed its whiskers, causing the tiger to reflexively bite down on the vet's forearm.",

      "When Northwest Orient Flight 2501 crashed, it was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.",
      "Valerie van Heest, executive director of the Michigan Shipwreck Association, said she has mixed feelings about ending the search, which began in 2004.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to have to say because part of me feels like we have failed,\" van Heest told The Detroit News, \u201cbut we have done so much to keep memory of this accident and these victims at forefront that I feel like we\u2019ve done better for them than if we\u2019d found the wreckage.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida officials are pursuing plans to build a second detention center to house immigrants, as part of the state\u2019s aggressive push to support the federal government's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday he\u2019s considering standing up a facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Jacksonville in northeast Florida, in addition to the site under construction at a remote airstrip in the Everglades that state officials have dubbed \u201c Alligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "The construction of that facility in the remote and ecologically sensitive wetland about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami is alarming environmentalists, as well as human rights advocates who have slammed the plan as cruel and inhumane.",
      "Speaking to reporters at an event in Tampa, DeSantis touted the state's muscular approach to immigration enforcement and its willingness to help President Donald Trump's administration meet its goal of more than doubling its existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds.",
      "State officials have said the detention facility, which has been described as temporary, will rely on heavy-duty tents, trailers, and other impermanent buildings, allowing the state to operationalize 5,000 immigration detention beds by early July and free up space in local jails.",
      "\u201cI think the capacity that will be added there will help the overall national mission. It will also relieve some burdens of our state and local (law enforcement),\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "Managing the facility \u201cvia a team of vendors\u201d will cost $245 a bed per day, or approximately $450 million a year, a U.S. official said. The expenses will be incurred by Florida and reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "In the eyes of DeSantis and other state officials, the remoteness of the Everglades airfield, surrounded by mosquito- and alligator-filled wetlands that are seen as sacred to Native American tribes, makes it an ideal place to detain migrants.",
      "\u201cClearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there\u2019s a lot of alligators,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Democrats and activists have condemned the plan as a callous, politically motivated spectacle.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is very concerning, the level of dehumanization,\u201d said Maria Asuncion Bilbao, Florida campaign coordinator at the immigration advocacy group American Friends Service Committee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a theatricalization of cruelty,\u201d she said.",
      "DeSantis is relying on state emergency powers to commandeer the county-owned airstrip and build the compound, over the concerns of county officials, environmentalists and human rights advocates.",
      "Now the state is considering standing up another site at a National Guard training facility in northeast Florida as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably also do something similar up at Camp Blanding,\u201d DeSantis said, adding that the state's emergency management division is \u201cworking on that.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Donald Trump...",
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Donald Trump's executive powers.",
      "The remarkable action lays bare the administration\u2019s determination to exert its will over immigration enforcement as well as a growing exasperation with federal judges who have time and again turned aside executive branch actions they see as lawless and without legal merit.",
      "\u201cIt's extraordinary,\" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said of the Justice Department's lawsuit. \u201cAnd it's escalating DOJ's effort to challenge federal judges.\u201d",
      "At issue is an order signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III and filed in May blocking the administration from immediately removing from the U.S. any immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The order blocks the removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the habeas corpus petition is filed.",
      "The administration says the automatic pause on removals violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president\u2019s authority to enforce immigration laws.",
      "The Republican administration has been locked for weeks in a growing showdown with the federal judiciary amid a barrage of legal challenges to the president's efforts to carry out key priorities around immigration and other matters. The Justice Department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking the president's agenda, accusing judges of improperly impeding the president's powers.",
      "\"President Trump\u2019s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,\u201d Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the Maryland district court declined to comment.",
      "Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. That led to an extraordinary statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said \u201cimpeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\u201d",
      "Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who has called the administration\u2019s deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador illegal. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have asked Xinis to impose fines against the administration for contempt, arguing that it ignored court orders for weeks to return him to the U.S.",
      "The order signed by Russell says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government \u201cfulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.\u201d",
      "In an amended order, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that \"resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Maryland judges to recuse themselves from the case. It wants a clerk to have a federal judge from another state hear it.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra University, described the lawsuit as further part of the erosion of legal norms by the administration. Normally when parties are on the losing side of an injunction, they appeal the order \u2014 not sue the court or judges, he said.",
      "On one hand, he said, the Justice Department has a point that injunctions should be considered extraordinary relief; it\u2019s unusual for them to be granted automatically in an entire class of cases. But, he added, it\u2019s the administration\u2019s own actions in repeatedly moving detainees to prevent them from obtaining writs of habeas corpus that prompted the court to issue the order.",
      "\u201cThe judges here didn\u2019t ask to be put in this unenviable position,\u201d Sample said. \u201cFaced with imperfect options, they have made an entirely reasonable, cautious choice to modestly check an executive branch that is determined to circumvent any semblance of impartial process.\u201d",

      "Weather forecasters are predicting wild temperature swings across the eastern U.S. Wednesday was expected to be another scorcher before temperatures plunge as much as 30 degrees",
      "NEW YORK -- A record-smashing heat wave broiled the U.S. East for another day Wednesday, even as thermometers were forecast to soon plunge by as many as 30 degrees in the same areas.",
      "The day's heat wasn't expected to be as intense as Tuesday, when at least 50 heat records were matched or broken and 21 places hit triple-digit temperatures. About 127 million Americans remained under National Weather Service heat advisories, down from the previous day. Sizzling temperatures sent utilities scrambling to keep the air conditioning and lights on amid massive demand for power.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be, I think, pretty bad across the East,'' meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center said Wednesday morning. \u201dI think today is probably the last day of widespread record potential. It might not be quite as hot as yesterday by a few degrees. But still, high temperatures are expected in the upper 90s across a good section of the East.\"",
      "The weather service warned of \u201cextreme heat\" for a stretch of the country from North Carolina to New York and west to West Virginia. Highs could approach triple digits from New York to Richmond, Oravec said.",
      "Temperatures Wednesday morning were \u201ca little bit warmer than expected\u201d because of northwesterly winds bringing \u201cwarm leftovers from yesterday,\u201d said former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist. Nantucket, Massachusetts, was above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) when its forecast high was 82.",
      "The high pressure heat dome that has baked the East was forecast to break. A cold front began moving south from New England, bringing with it clouds and cooler temperatures \u2014 not only cooler than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), but cooler than normal.",
      "That air mass drawing on cool ocean waters will send temperatures plummeting by the end of the week in Philadelphia, which hit a record high of 101 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, said Ray Martin, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Air temperatures will be in the low 70s Fahrenheit (20s Celsius).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to feel like a shock to the system, but it\u2019s not anything particularly unusual,\u201d said Martin.",
      "Boston's forecast high for Friday is 34 degrees lower than what it hit Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt's going to feel like a different season,\" Oravec said.",
      "However, it won't last. After one or two days, slightly hotter than normal temperatures are forecast, but not anywhere near the highs from earlier this week, Oravec said.",
      "Weather whiplash from one extreme to another occurs more often as the world warms overall from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, scientists said.",
      "Tuesday was likely the peak of the heat, with Baltimore the king of swelter. The city's high of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) smashed a previous record by four degrees. At night, when the human body needs cooling, temperatures only dropped to 87 Fahrenheit (30 Celsius).",
      "Baltimore was hardly alone. A dozen weather stations were 101 degrees or higher, including two New York airports. Boston hit 102, breaking its old record by seven degrees. Augusta, Maine's 100-degrees also broke its old record by seven degrees.",
      "Every coastal state from Maine to South Carolina hit 100 degrees somewhere, with Georgia and Florida clocking in at 99 on Tuesday.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the mid-Atlantic areas ... don\u2019t have to prepare for extreme heat the way Arizona or Texas do,\" University of Texas energy engineering professor Michael Webber said in an email. \u201cSo, extreme heat is less familiar and therefore more operationally challenging for them. ... And, they haven\u2019t built as many new power plants.\u201d",
      "Extreme heat caused the road to buckle in two locations on an interstate highway in northern New Jersey. State transportation officials say the impact on the concrete roadway in Morris County on Tuesday afternoon forced some lane closures as temporary repairs were made. Crews then began work to replace the damaged areas and repave those sections.",
      "Some downtown Chicago streets will close Wednesday night to repair pavement that has buckled due to hot temperatures amid an ongoing heat wave in the city.",

      "\u201cThey will not intimidate me. They will not stop me from doing my job,\u201d she said outside the courthouse in Newark after the brief hearing.",
      "McIver, a Democrat, was charged by interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, following the May 9 visit to Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the privately owned, 1,000-bed facility as a detention center.",
      "This month she was indicted on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.",

The prosecution is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption.",

McIver and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s spending cuts and border security package would inject hundreds of billions of dollars into his mass deportation agenda",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s spending cuts and border security package would inject roughly $150 billion into his mass deportation agenda over the next four years, funding everything from an extension of the United States' southern border wall to detention centers to thousands of additional law enforcement staff.",
      "The current annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the government's primary department for immigration enforcement, is around $10 billion. If the Republican president's big bill passes in Congress, the immense cash infusion could reshape America\u2019s immigration system by expanding the law enforcement and detention network while increasing costs to legally immigrate to the U.S.",
      "The Senate is debating its own version of the bill, which largely aligns with the House's approach when it comes to these issues. In recent days, Republicans have focused on sometimes-violent protests against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown to press for quick passage over Democratic opposition.",
      "That\u2019s what happened earlier in June when protests triggered unrest in parts of Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThe lawlessness happening in LA is ANOTHER reason why we need to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill IMMEDIATELY,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X. \u201cIt provides the ESSENTIAL funding needed to secure our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d",
      "Plenty, though, remains unclear about the legislation.",
      "\u201cOne thing about this bill, these sections are super vague,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, including multibillion-dollar expenditures sometimes explained in just a few vague lines. \u201cThere\u2019s no real specificity in the bill about how it\u2019s going to be spent.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some key immigration sections of the 1,000-page bill, as approved by the House, and what it could mean for the U.S. government\u2019s posture on immigration:",
      "WHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill sets aside $46.5 billion for what the House Homeland Security Committee calls an \u201cintegrated border barrier system,\u201d including fencing, water barriers, law enforcement access roads and technology like movement sensors. The funding would complete 701 miles (1,128 kilometers) of primary walls and 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) of river barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the committee. It is the bill\u2019s largest expenditure.",
      "\u201cAny lawmaker who claims to care about border security will need to put their money where their mouth is and work to advance these recommendations,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee.",
      "THE IMPACT: Building the wall has long been one of Trump\u2019s signature promises, but its impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would've surrendered to law enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn\u2019t even attempt to cross.",
      "Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human smugglers, often linked to drug cartels, have used tunnels, ladders and power tools to cross walls.",
      "But, experts note that though illegal crossings are down now, that can change rapidly.",
      "WHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill, which top White House aide and immigration hawk Stephen Miller has called \u201cthe most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World,\u201d sets aside $45 billion to expand the network of immigrant detention facilities for adult migrants and families.",
      "The standards in adult facilities, the bill notes, would be set at \u201cthe sole discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d",
      "More than $12 billion was also requested for 18,000 new ICE and Border Patrol personnel.",
      "THE IMPACT: ICE has said it wants to increase its current detention capacity from about 41,000 people to 100,000. It's part of what ICE\u2019s acting director, Todd Lyons, has suggested is a deportation system that could function \u201clike Amazon, trying to get your product delivered in 24 hours.\u201d",
      "ICE currently has about 6,000 deportation officers, a number that's been stagnant for years.",
      "While expanding staff and detention centers would make it easier for the administration to increase deportations, even the tens of billions of dollars the bill requests may not be enough to meet Trump\u2019s goals. Miller has said ICE should be making 3,000 arrests per day of people in the country illegally. That's a vast increase over the roughly 650 arrested a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "But the plans are a boon to America\u2019s private prison industry, with stock prices for the two dominant companies, Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic, up more than 50% since Trump\u2019s election.",
      "WHAT THE BILL SAYS: The legislation sets aside $1.25 billion for the immigration court system, with funds to hire more immigration judges and support staff and to expand courtroom capacity. The courts' annual budget currently stands at roughly $850 million.",
      "THE IMPACT: The immigration court system, which has roughly 700 judges, has struggled for years with chronic understaffing and a backlog that has reached more than 3.6 million cases. Judges typically take more than five years to make decisions.",
      "It\u2019s a chaotic system, with overworked judges, a shortage of translators and immigrants who often don\u2019t have lawyers.",
      "The chaos has grown in recent weeks, with immigration courts seeing a spike in arrests outside courtrooms as agents wait to detain immigrants attending routine hearings. The arrests have spread fed confusion and fear, especially among asylum-seekers, who are accustomed to remaining free while their cases plod their way through the system.",
      "The proposed funding would be \"a significant increase, and from an institutional perspective it\u2019s urgently needed money,\u201d said Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.",
      "But he also believes the rising numbers of courthouse arrests reflect an administration looking for ways to bypass immigration courts.",
      "WHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill overhauls the system of immigration costs, with dramatic increases and new fees imposed for once-free services.",
      "Applying for asylum, which has long been free, will now cost $1,000, with asylum-seekers paying another $550 for employment applications. Among other fee increases, appealing an immigration judge decision jumps from $110 to $900 and applying for temporary protected status, which allows people from certain countries facing civil unrest or natural disasters to stay temporarily in the U.S., goes from $50 to $500.",
      "THE IMPACT: For wealthier immigrants, the new fees will be an inconvenience. But for the vast majority of people even a few hundred dollars could be enough to make them change their plans.",

      "Ohio plans a swift appeal of a decision declaring the state's private school voucher system unconstitutional",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio signaled on Wednesday that it will swiftly appeal a court ruling declaring the state's private school voucher system unconstitutional, a decision celebrated by public school advocates and condemned by a prominent Christian education organization.",
      "Republican Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement that he is confident the state will ultimately win. He assured Ohio families that the judge's order allows the program to remain operational as the lawsuit is argued, \"so parents don\u2019t have to panic or worry about other options while the court process plays out.\u201d",
      "Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page granted summary judgment Tuesday in a 2022 lawsuit joined by hundreds of public school districts, known collectively as Vouchers Hurt Ohio, as well as some parents, students and a fair school funding group.",
      "The plaintiffs had argued that Ohio\u2019s 28-year-old school voucher plan, known as EdChoice, has over time created an unconstitutional system of separately funded private schools and led to resegregation of some districts because mostly nonminority students take advantage of the program.",
      "Page, a Democrat, agreed that the program violates a provision of the Ohio Constitution requiring \u201ca thorough and efficient system of common schools,\" but rejected claims that it violated the equal protection clause.",
      "She used her 47-page decision to recount Ohio's history of funding schools, noting that evidence presented in the case spanned from before statehood to the 2023 state budget bill that established a universal voucher program providing tuition to nonpublic schools, including religious ones, to any family in the state.",
      "Page notably rejected the widely used \u201cschool choice\u201d legal argument, which says that voucher programs involve spending decisions made by individual parents, not by the state.",
      "The judge found that argument failed in this case. She said families aren't the EdChoice program's final decision-makers: \u201cThe ultimate decision to accept prospective students, and by doing so receive EdChoice funds, lies with the private school.\u201d",
      "The Ohio Christian Education Network, the rapidly expanding education arm of the Center for Christian Virtue, expressed strong disagreement with the ruling.",
      "\u201cThis decision is poorly reasoned and ignores mountains of previous school choice jurisprudence at both (the) state and federal levels,\u201d Troy McIntosh, the network's executive director, said in a statement. \u201dThe fact is that this decision is not only an improper legal decision, but it could result in almost 100,000 Ohio students being tossed out of the school they have chosen to attend.\"",
      "The Ohio Education Association, the state's largest teachers union, praised the ruling as a win for the nearly 90% of K-12 students who attend Ohio's public schools.",
      "\"Although this legal victory is likely the first step in a much longer process through the appeals courts, the ruling Tuesday represents a huge victory for Ohio\u2019s public school educators, school communities, and students who have seen critical resources diverted from our public schools for years to fund private school tuition payments for mostly-wealthy families whose children had never attended their local public schools in the first place,\u201d OEA President Scott DiMauro said in a statement.",

      "\u201cYou guys are always tagging everything up, claiming hood, and now that your hood\u2019s being invaded by the biggest gang there is, there ain\u2019t a peep out of you,\u201d Gonzalez said, using a disparaging term often aimed at Mexican men who are members of street gangs.",
      "She further referenced \u201c18th Street\u201d and \u201cFlorence,\u201d two infamous street gangs, and questioned why gang members were not protesting or speaking up about the immigration raids.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there fighting our turf, protecting our turf, protecting our people and, like, where you at?\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

      "The other four counts are sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",

      "The Grammy-winning R&B stars announced Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings\" their first-ever co-headlining tour, \"The Boy Is Mine,\" a 24-city arena run that kicks off on Oct. 16 in Cincinnati and concludes on Dec. 7 in Houston.",
      "\"They were trying to get us to do a tour since '98 and it just finally felt like the right time,\" Brandy said. \"It was a dream come true.\"",
      "Monica called her partnership with Brandy a \"musical marriage.\"",
      "\"We created the communication and the relationship to do it,\" she said.",
      "The tour marks a historic reunion for the duo whose 1998 duet spent a record-breaking 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, placing them alongside Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as artists who have commanded the chart's top spot for 13 weeks or more.",
      "The song gained momentum again after the pair made a surprise appearance in Ariana Grande's \"The Boy is Mine\" music video last year, sparking viral interest and earning them a Grammy nomination for their remix collaboration more than 25 years after winning their first Grammy for the original song.",
      "Joining them are Grammy winner Kelly Rowland, chart-topping singer-songwriter Muni Long and 2025 American Idol winner Jamal Roberts.",
      "The original song became one of the most iconic collaborations in late '90s R&B and it earned the duo a Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1999.",
      "The announcement comes after years of reported tension between the two artists, which both singers acknowledged during the interview.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and conflict and there was a lot of people around,\" Monica said.",
      "Despite the song's romantic theme about competing for the same man, both artists say they don't share the same taste in partners.",
      "\"We don't even like the same type of boy\u2026there could never have been a boy,\" said Monica.",
      "The singers said choosing songs from both their catalogs will be tough.",
      "\"That part is hard. We want to give them everything that they want, but we can't keep you there all night. So we have to figure out a way to condense this into two hours of just a celebration of music, celebration of womanhood,\" Monica said.",

    "summary": "His mother is a member of the Kennedy clan; his father was the Terminator. Now, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, a standout in the HBO Max series \"The White Lotus,\" talks about how he chose to pursue a career while carrying the weight of a famous Hollywood name.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1967, this video introduced a new American band: The Doors, who would quickly light the music world on fire, with a sound hypnotic, mystical, and almost menacing:",
      "You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Tried to run, tried to hide Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side, yeah",
      "They came together 60 years ago in Venice, California: Jim Morrison, a poet in leather pants, backed by Ray Manzarek on keys, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums.",
      "The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. \"Oh, I need a haircut,\" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit.",
      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",
      "\"He lived for The Doors,\" said Krieger. \"I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over.\"",
      "Manzarek died in 2013.",
      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",
      "To the end, The Doors were an improvisational group. One of their best-known songs grew out of another tune they were jamming on in a session. \"We were goofing around,\" said Densmore, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" morphed into \"Riders on the Storm.\" It would be Morrison's final recording.",
      "At the Whisky a Go Go every month, Krieger (now 79) has been playing a Doors album in its entirety. Densmore (80) recently sat in on drums.",
      "\"Well, these two geezers are still breathing,\" Densmore laughed. \"Keith and Mick are 80 and they're out there pumpin'. There's other roads!\"",

      "Nestle said Wednesday it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by the middle of 2026.",
      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump's Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",

In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",

      "The Danish drugmaker said\u00a0Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold \"illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk.\"",
      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",

      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro.

    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",

      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",

      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022.

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. The latter, roughly 25 miles north of Miami, offered 70 daily flights to over 30 destinations as of April of this year.",
      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",
      "The decision to terminate service at Miami International comes four years after JetBlue added the airport to its network. At its peak, the airline was operating as many as 14 daily flights to and from Miami International, according to the Miami Herald.",

    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",

    "summary": "Some of the nation's health insurers say they're taking steps to speed the process by which doctors approve medical care.",
    "story": [
      "UnitedHealthcare, Kaiser Permanente and other major U.S. health insurers say they want to make it faster and easier for patients to obtain care.",
      "Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association that represents the health insurance industry, announced Monday that some of its biggest members are taking steps to streamline \"prior authorization\" \u2014 industry jargon for the process by which health care providers obtain approval from patients' insurance carriers to deliver care.",
      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",
      "Dozens of insurers signed onto the commitment, including a number of state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and some Medicare and Medicaid plans. In all, AHIP says the joint effort to improve prior authorization could benefit more than 250 million Americans.",
      "The signatories include:",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Jun 2025 12:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "On June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The median home sale price in the U.S. just touched a record high, but new data shows that buyers are nevertheless paying below asking price.",
      "The median sale price hit a record $396,500 for the four weeks ending June 15, or a 1% increase from a year earlier, according to a Friday report from\u00a0Redfin. But buyers are actually paying far less than sellers' median asking price, which stood at $422,238 for the same period, the real estate company's data shows.",
      "That means buyers paid 6%, or $26,000, less than sellers hoped they would.",
      "Americans are increasingly finding themselves squeezed out of the housing market, as mortgage rates remain high and the inventory of affordable homes remains low. As a result, the dream of home ownership, which is a meaningful way to build wealth, is becoming more distant for large swaths of the population.",
      "Last year, just 24% of home sales came from first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010, data from the National Association of Realtors shows. The typical first-time homebuyer's age also hit an all-time high of 38, according to the group.",
      "For those Americans who are trying to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder, data from Redfin shows that sellers may be willing to be flexible on price, especially as there are now more sellers than buyers in the market.",
      "High housing costs and widespread economic uncertainty have hurt demand, Redfin said.",
      "As a result, the onus is on sellers to make sure their homes are in tip-top shape, and are reasonably priced, otherwise they're unlikely to sell, according to Redfin.",
      "\"I'm explaining to sellers more and more that we need to be strategic in our pricing strategy because homes that are overpriced, even slightly, are likely to sit on the market and invite buyers to negotiate,\" Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Redfin agent Kelly Connally said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"Pricing is most important, but with fewer buyers than usual out there, sellers should also make sure their home is in excellent condition and be ready to make repairs upon inspection.\"",
      "Buyers can't necessarily expect a discount on their home of choice, though.",
      "\"There are a few exceptions: Homes in desirable locations that are in perfect condition are still hot and typically sell at or above asking price,\" Connally said.",

      "On Thursday, Hegseth slammed media outlets for \"breathlessly\" reporting the \"initial\" assessment. He accused the alleged leaker of having an \"agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Hegseth have said using multiple 30,000 pound bombs \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear ambitions.",

      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

      "\"My dad told me it's horrible inside and they've kept him standing,\" he said, adding his father managed to make his first phone call on Sunday. \"They're not feeding him and there are no blankets inside.\"",
      "Hurtado was taken into custody while he was working \u2014 picking up trash. His son says he doesn't have a criminal record or a removal order.",
      "Hurtado is a Mexican national and a father of three children, all U.S. citizens, including one with special medical needs.",
      "\"My dad suffers from high blood pressure and we haven't heard from him since Sunday,\" Hurtado's son said. \"I only had a few seconds to speak with him on the phone before the call was cut off so I've been coming every day to see if I can get any news of him.\"",
      "Longtime food vendor and community activist Emma De Paz, 58, is also being held here. She was detained last week when federal officers conducted an operation at a Home Depot in Hollywood where De Paz was selling carne asada. According to her family, De Paz was recently diagnosed with Hepatitis B and needs daily medication to treat her high blood pressure. She was transferred to White Memorial Hospital during her detention to undergo care.",
      "\"My sister called us to say they're treating them really bad,\" said Carlos Barrera De Paz during a Wednesday press conference outside of the Guatemalan consulate in Los Angeles. \"They are in a cold room, no food, they're given a pack of cookies and a juice per day.\"",
      "De Paz added his sister claims agents are pressuring her to sign deportation paperwork and has had to sleep in a chair.",
      "Immigration lawyers in L.A. tell CBS News, they've been receiving more and more calls about medical needs that aren't being addressed at the Metropolitan Detention Center. One lawyer, who chose not to identify herself because she has clients inside the detention center, said there are reports of \"inhumane\" conditions \u2014 food shortages, cramped confinement, freezing temperatures and environments that are a \"ticking-time bomb.\"",
      "\"There is limited and very erratic access to food,\" Kristen Hunsberger, an attorney with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told CBS News during a phone interview. \"I spoke with one individual detained in downtown Los Angeles who reported being woken up at 2 a.m. or 4 a.m., was given food, and they wouldn't have their next meal until 14 hours later.\"",
      "Hunsberger described similar conditions at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Adelanto, California, where some migrants detained in the latest rounds of raids have been transferred.",
      "Hunsberger says her clients have been denied access to medication, some have been kept in temporary holding areas with no air circulation and have at times been left without communication because of the lack of working phones.",
      "\"I would describe it as very chaotic \u2014 it's really an emerging crisis,\" Hunsberger said. \"I'm concerned that if left unaddressed, that we will start hearing about, God forbid, people start dying or having health crises in these detention centers because of the delay in access or just complete denial of access.\"",
      "Government data obtained by CBS News reveals ICE is holding around 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country. On Monday, ICE detention levels reached over 140% capacity, since Congress last allocated 41,500 detainee beds for the agency.",
      "In a statement earlier this week, ICE said its effort to target a \"massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States\" has led to \"a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,\" ICE added, noting the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by the president would fund 100,000 more detention beds.",
      "Immigration lawyers also say that as the Trump administration ramps up its deportation efforts, a lack of due process is widespread across the L.A. area, in particular because of the lack of phone access inside detention centers.",
      "On Tuesday, CBS News spoke with a family of four that was deported to Peru last week. The Peruvian family was scheduled for a court hearing on June 25 for their asylum case, but received a notification from ICE to attend a check-in appointment on June 5 instead. It was during that check-in that Ever Cardenas said he was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center for over 12 hours, along with his wife and two daughters, ages 9 and 14, and forced to sign their deportation paperwork.",
      "\"I told them we had rights and didn't have to sign anything,\" Cardenas told CBS News in Spanish during a phone interview from Peru. \"I begged them for hours to let me call a lawyer, but they refused to let us use a phone. Eventually we were left with no options and signed.\"",
      "According to Cardenas, his family was transferred out of the downtown facility to a nearby hotel and placed in a room with other families overnight. The family was eventually put on a flight, transferred to Texas and has since been deported to Peru.",
      "\"I just wanted to talk to a lawyer,\" Cardenas said. \"I kept telling agents that my daughter was going to miss her middle school graduation the following day, but that didn't matter.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE with questions about current conditions and whether detention facilities in Los Angeles are over capacity.",
      "Earlier this month, some members of Congress attempted to visit the Metropolitan Detention Center to conduct oversight of the facility, but they were denied access. Until recently, they were allowed by law to enter any DHS facility \"used to detain or otherwise house aliens\" for inspection purposes, and no prior notice was necessary.",
      "But DHS issued new guidance last week for lawmakers visiting ICE facilities, requiring 72-hour notice and blocking U.S. lawmakers from visiting field offices, such as the facilities in downtown L.A. As of Wednesday, however, that memo has been removed from ICE's website.",
      "According to Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California, he has been denied entry to the downtown facility three times despite representing that area of L.A..",
      "\"DHS has illegally blocked me from entering this facility three times\u2014even though I'm authorized under federal law to conduct oversight. Also egregious is that they've already cancelled a scheduled inspection,\" Gomez told CBS News in a statement Wednesday evening. \"Now they're telling my office I need a week's notice, which sounds more like they're giving themselves time to hide any signs of abuse or move the detainees altogether. If these reports aren't true, then let us in. But this administration continues to operate outside the bounds of the law. That's why I'm going to keep fighting to conduct oversight and hold them accountable.\"",

      "Rep. Kat Cammack said late Wednesday her offices were evacuated due to \"imminent death threats\" against her and her family.",
      "The Florida Republican said on X the threats began after a recent Wall Street Journal story about her experience with an ectopic pregnancy last year. She told the paper that emergency room doctors were hesitant to treat the life-threatening complication because they were worried about running afoul of Florida's strict six-week abortion ban \u2014 an incident she blamed on \"fearmongering\" by opponents of the state law.",
      "\"Since then, we've [received] thousands of hate-filled messages and dozens of credible threats from pro-abortion activists, which law enforcement is actively investigating,\" Cammack wrote in her post, which also included screenshots of several social media comments.",
      "Cammack added on X, \"To those spreading misinformation: I did not vote for Florida's heartbeat law; I serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, not the Florida Legislature.\"",
      "Cammack's post did not specify which congressional offices were evacuated. CBS News has reached out to her office and the U.S. Capitol Police for more details.",
      "Concerns about medical treatment for pregnancy complications \u2014 including ectopic pregnancies \u2014 have spiked since 2022, when the reversal of Roe v. Wade led dozens of states to ban or heavily restrict abortion.",
      "State-level abortion bans generally allow for exceptions when a mother's life is at risk. And officials in Florida and other states say terminating an ectopic pregnancy \u2014 a condition in which an embryo implants outside the uterus \u2014 is not considered an abortion. But critics argue confusion about those exceptions has put patients at risk, as medical providers may be wary of taking action that could later be found to violate their state's abortion ban.",
      "Florida state regulators issued a\u00a0notice\u00a0last year that said \"abortion is permissible at any stage of pregnancy in Florida to save the life and health of the mother,\" including for women with ectopic pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, threats against members of Congress, judges, prosecutors and other public officials have grown in recent years, federal law enforcement agencies say.

It also partially restricted entry for nationals from another seven countries, including Cuba, with only certain exemptions. Under the ban, only U.S. citizens can apply to sponsor relatives from Cuba, not green card holders like Llanes.",

    "story": [
      "The heads of two key American intelligence agencies issued statements Wednesday on what they said was \"new\" intelligence on the damage resulting from the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, each noting the Iranian program was likely to have been set back by \"years.\"",
      "The statements were released after President Trump decried a leaked, preliminary assessment produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency that said Tehran's nuclear program had only been pushed back by a matter of months.",
      "Mr. Trump had ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities late Saturday, adding to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against targets in Iran.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Wednesday that \"a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes.\"",
      "\"This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\" Ratcliffe's statement said.",
      "It added the agency would continue to collect \"additional reliably sourced information\" to share with policymakers, and, when possible, to provide updates to the public.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to elaborate on the intelligence referenced by Ratcliffe's statement, including the confidence level associated with it or whether it included Israeli or other foreign intelligence.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also wrote on X that \"new intelligence confirms what President Trump has stated numerous times: Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.\"",

      "An intelligence official later confirmed to CBS News that the information shared by Gabbard was based on new American intelligence, but declined to specify its confidence level.",
      "Neither of the statements directly addressed some of the questions raised by lawmakers and nonproliferation experts in the aftermath of the strikes about what kinds of residual nuclear capabilities Iran may have retained.",
      "There are also conflicting views about whether Iranian officials had managed to transport enriched uranium away from the sites before they were bombed. The DIA assessment indicated at least some of the enriched uranium had been moved, according to one source familiar with it.",
      "But when asked whether enriched material was successfully moved during a press availability following the NATO summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday, President Trump said, \"We think we hit them so hard and so fast, they didn't get to move.\"",
      "The president also said the U.S. and Iran were expected to hold talks \"next week.\" The format remains unclear, for now, but special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to lead the talks, if they happen, two U.S. officials told CBS News. Witkoff has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister, and recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance have also become more involved in the diplomacy, a U.S. and regional diplomat told CBS News.",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were slated to participate in a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday on the U.S. strikes in Iran, but the session was cancelled and rescheduled for Thursday. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. It is unclear whether both leaders will still participate in both briefings.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard's statements on Wednesday also included criticism of the leak to media outlets of the DIA assessment, which a spokesperson for that agency later said was issued with low confidence and would be refined as additional intelligence becomes available.",
      "The initial DIA report said the entrances to two Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 including the Fordo facility \u2014 were sealed off in the strikes, but that Iran could reconstitute elements of its program once it dug out and made repairs to water and electrical systems, according to sources familiar with it.",
      "The assessment also provided a range of possibilities for how long it could take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume some operations, ranging from a few months to less than a year, one source familiar with the assessment told CBS News.",
      "Administration officials have blasted those findings, which are at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that Saturday night's airstrikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Speaking from the NATO summit, Mr. Trump said the airstrikes set back Iran's program by \"basically decades.\"",
      "\"They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know,\" Mr. Trump said of the U.S. intelligence assessments.",

In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",

      "Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and\u00a0led the president to call\u00a0roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as\u00a0Title 10.

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring Lyn Redwood, a nurse and the former head of a group critics have denounced as anti-vaccine, to work in its vaccine safety office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Trump's executive powers.",
    "story": [
      "In an unusual move, the Trump administration on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.",
      "At issue is a May order signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III blocking the administration from immediately removing from the U.S. any immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The order blocks the removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the habeas corpus petition is filed.",
      "The administration says the automatic pause on removals violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president's authority to enforce immigration laws.",
      "It's rare for anyone \u2014 especially the federal government \u2014 to sue the entire federal bench in a state. The action ratchets up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Trump's immigration policies, and underscores the administration's growing exasperation with federal judges who have turned aside executive branch actions.",
      "\"It's extraordinary,\" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, told the Associated Press of the Justice Department's lawsuit. \"And it's escalating DOJ's effort to challenge federal judges.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been locked for weeks in a growing showdown with the federal judiciary amid a barrage of legal challenges to the president's policies, especially his efforts to rapidly ramp up deportations. The Justice Department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking the president's agenda, accusing judges of improperly impeding the president's powers.",
      "\"President Trump's executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Wednesday. \"The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.\"",
      "A spokesman for the Maryland district court declined to comment to the AP.",
      "Mr. Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington, D.C., who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around \u2014 and later threatened to hold government officials in contempt for defying his orders. That led Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare statement saying, \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit is U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who has called the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador illegal. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have asked Xinis to impose fines against the administration for contempt, arguing that it ignored court orders for weeks to return him to the U.S.",
      "The government acknowledged that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, and a Justice Department lawyer said in Xinis' courtroom that the department didn't give him sufficient information about the case. That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was later fired, and filed a whistleblower complaint obtained by CBS News this week that alleged top officials at the department talked about ignoring court orders and withholding information from judges. Justice Department officials denied the allegations.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ultimately returned to the U.S. earlier this month and hit with smuggling charges. A judge declined the government's request to detain him pre-trial last weekend, but he will remain in federal custody at least until Friday.",
      "The order signed by Russell that led to this week's lawsuit says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government \"fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.\"",
      "In an amended order, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after-hours that \"resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.\"",
      "But the Trump administration says the judge cannot issue a standing order that automatically enjoins the government from removing people who file habeas petitions. The lawsuit called the order \"lawless\" and \"judicial overreach.\"",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Maryland judges to recuse themselves from the case. It wants a clerk to have a federal judge from another state hear it.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra University, described the lawsuit as further part of the erosion of legal norms by the administration. Normally when parties are on the losing side of an injunction, they appeal the order \u2014 not sue the court or judges, he said.",
      "On one hand, he said, the Justice Department has a point that injunctions should be considered extraordinary relief; it's unusual for them to be granted automatically in an entire class of cases. But, he added, it's the administration's own actions in repeatedly moving detainees to prevent them from obtaining writs of habeas corpus that prompted the court to issue the order.",
      "\"The judges here didn't ask to be put in this unenviable position,\" Sample told the Associated Press. \"Faced with imperfect options, they have made an entirely reasonable, cautious choice to modestly check an executive branch that is determined to circumvent any semblance of impartial process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was deported back to his home country and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, is set to remain in jail until at least Friday, as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can stop him from being deported if he is released from federal custody pending his trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and federal prosecutors met in court in Nashville on Wednesday for a hearing to discuss the conditions of his release after U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes on Sunday denied a Justice Department request to keep Abrego Garcia detained while awaiting a criminal trial.",
      "After Wednesday's hearing, Holmes ordered Abrego Garcia's lawyers to file court papers laying out their arguments by noon on Thursday, and gave the government until noon on Friday to respond. Holmes said she will issue a ruling at some point after that. Until then, Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals.",
      "In her decision over the weekend, Holmes said Abrego Garcia should be released, with certain conditions. But she noted, and lawyers for both sides acknowledged, that the Salvadoran man would likely be detained by federal immigration authorities for removal proceedings if released on criminal charges.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed Holmes' release order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause that decision.",
      "The judge, Waverly Crenshaw, set a hearing for July 16 to consider the government's bid to revoke the release order.",
      "\"The government emphasizes that absent a stay, it will incur the irreparable injury of Abrego possibly facing deportation from the United States pursuant to the immigration detainer lodged against him by DHS,\" Crenshaw wrote in his decision denying the Justice Department's stay request. \"If deported, the government argues, the Department of Justice will be deprived of the opportunity to pursue its criminal charges against Abrego. At bottom, the government asks the court to save it from itself because it may suffer irreparable harm completely of its own making.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Holmes' acknowledged in her order that Abrego Garcia was likely to remain in custody \u2014 either of the U.S. Marshals or Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 regardless of how she ruled on the detention request, and said her analysis was \"little more than an academic exercise.\" But in a filing with the court, the Justice Department said that a release of Abrego Garcia into custody of immigration authorities \"poses potentially irreparable problems\" for the prosecution of his case and the public.",
      "If the court refuses to pause Holmes' release order and Abrego Garcia is moved to ICE custody and deported, \"the prosecution would lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case,\" prosecutors said, acknowledging that his potential deportation would not be \"instantaneous.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers called the Justice Department's concerns about his potential deportation while awaiting trial a \"possible self-inflicted injury by its executive branch colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case garnered significant public attention after a Trump administration immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" A Salvadoran native, Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has resided in Maryland for more than a decade.",
      "He was placed on a removal flight in March as part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and promise of mass deportations, and sent with hundreds of other migrants to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, however, had been granted a legal status known as withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented the Department of Homeland Security from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because of likely persecution by gangs.",
      "A federal judge in April ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., and that portion of her order was affirmed by the Supreme Court later that month. While the Trump administration resisted efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. for weeks, it finally did so earlier this month so he could face prosecution for alleged human smuggling.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee returned the indictment against Abrego Garcia in late May. The charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when he was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped and said they had been performing construction work in St. Louis, according to body camera footage released by the Highway Patrol.",
      "An April report from the Department of Homeland Security regarding the incident said Abrego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime. He was given a warning citation by the Tennessee officers.",
      "Abrego Garcia was arraigned earlier this month, and Holmes held a hearing to determine whether he should be detained or released ahead of his trial.",
      "In finding that Abrego Garcia should be released, the magistrate judge said that she \"cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego's release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community.\"",
      "Holmes called the government's evidence \"unreliable\" and claims of Abrego Garcia's alleged membership in the gang MS-13 \"simply insufficient,\" as government cooperating witnesses gave an ICE investigator \"conflicting\" information.",
      "The judge said the government put forth \"hearsay statements\" from cooperating witnesses who stand \"to gain something from their testimony in this case.\"",
      "One of the cooperators has two felony convictions, has been deported five times and was released early from a 30-month federal prison sentence for human smuggling for providing information to the government in Abrego Garcia's case, Holmes wrote. He is also the purported \"domestic leader\" of the human smuggling organization that prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia participated in, the judge said.",
      "The second cooperator is an \"avowed member of the human smuggling organization,\" according to the judge, and is in custody charged with a federal crime \"for which he hopes to be released in exchange for\" his testimony before the grand jury. Holmes said the second man has also been deported before and has now requested deferred action on his removal in exchange for his cooperation with the government in Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "Holmes said their statements about Abrego Garcia \u2014 namely regarding his alleged smuggling trips from Maryland to Houston and back \u2014 \"defy common sense.\"",

    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department official Emil Bove, who has been nominated for the federal appeals bench, testified before the Senate Wednesday that he never told department attorneys to ignore court orders, denying the account of a whistleblower.",
      "Bove, a former criminal defense attorney who represented President Trump, rejected suggestions by Democrats that the claims of whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, render him unfit to serve on the appeals court. His nomination has come under scrutiny after Reuveni\u00a0said in a complaint made public Tuesday that in one meeting, Bove had used an expletive when saying the Trump administration might need to ignore judicial commands.",
      "\"I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, \"I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.\"",
      "Bove was nominated last month by Mr. Trump to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Mr. Trump's defense team for his New York hush money trial and defended him in the two federal criminal cases brought by the Justice Department.",
      "The White House said Bove \"is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit.\"",
      "\"The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email.",
      "Reuveni, a 14-year veteran of the Justice Department, was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison. He sent a letter on Tuesday to members of Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general seeking an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Bove and other officials in the weeks leading up to his firing.",
      "Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March about Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, citing a claim of a U.S. invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni says Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. He claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and \"ignore any such order,\" his lawyers said in the letter.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called the allegations \"utterly false.\" He said he was at the March meeting, and \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "\"Planting a false hit piece the day before a confirmation hearing is something we have come to expect from the media, but it does not mean it should be tolerated,\" Blanche wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.",

      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Adrian Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 10:16:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says U.S. strikes \"obliterated\" key Iranian nuclear sites, setting the program back decades, but sources say an early intel assessment says Iran could rebuild some of its capabilities in months.",
    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "\"This is a preliminary, low confidence assessment \u2014 not a final conclusion \u2014 and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available,\" a senior DIA official told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We have still not been able to review the actual physical sites themselves, which will give us the best indication.\"",
      "The official added that the agency was \"working with the FBI and other authorities to investigate the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\"",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "He reiterated that assertion Wednesday morning in the Netherlands, where he was attending a NATO summit, telling reporters the \"they're not going to be building bombs for a long time.\"",
      "\"I think that Israel is going to be telling us very soon, because Bibi [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] is going to have people involved in that whole situation. We hear it was obliteration, it a was a virtual obliteration,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he did not believe the Iranians \"had a chance to get anything out\" of their underground nuclear facilities before the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying: \"We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran's military nuclear program, has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. The achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force\u00a0joined Israel's strikes, on President Trump's orders, dropping several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume its work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump blasted reports on the DIA assessment in a Truth Social post, writing, \"THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "In an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the release of the DIA report \"treasonous.\" He said \"we know for a fact\" that the Natanz site was destroyed, and said of the Fordo strike, \"there's no doubt that it was obliterated.\"",
      "Witkoff also said \"it will be almost impossible for them to resurrect that program,\" adding, \"it will take a period of years.\"",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported. Other U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran would need a minimum of six to eighteen months to create a weapon they could deliver with success.",
      "But Israel has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was \"very close to having one.\" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",

    "story": [
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to be holding after days of deadly conflict between the Middle East's arch rivals. President Trump said Tuesday that it was \"in effect.\" Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the\u00a0agreement he had announced\u00a0just hours before.",
      "Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect and said it would \"respond forcefully.\"",
      "But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump \u2014 including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 the bombardments ceased.",
      "The State Department announced Tuesday night in a social media post that the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would reopen Wednesday \"as usual,\" adding that all shelter-in-place orders for U.S. government employees had been lifted. However, government employees and their family members were still restricted from traveling  outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva areas.",
      "The State Department noted that Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv was reopening after being shuttered for several days, but that the State Department was also still providing limited evacuation flights for U.S. citizens and green card holders out of Israel.",
      "How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,\" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire would take hold in stages, the president said. A White House official told CBS News that Iran would halt strikes against Israel from midnight Eastern Time, and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that, from noon ET on Tuesday. Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began.",
      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire.",
      "\"I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,\" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel.",
      "\"I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin.",
      "\"Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would \"see if I can stop it.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy with them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?\"",
      "Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu.",
      "A White House source told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"exceptionally firm and direct\" in the call about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire, and the source said Netanyahu had \"understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed.\"",
      "In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"refrained from further attacks\" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches.",
      "Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran",
      "In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on \"the heart of Tehran\" at 3 a.m. local, \"hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces.\"",
      "\"Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,\" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles.",
      "\"At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.\"",
      "At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began.",
      "Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",

      "\"When the ICE raids started picking up on other states, we knew that we were going to get hit eventually,\" Ear told CBS News. \"Nobody's safe.\"",
      "Since President Trump began his second term, ICE has arrested more than 100,000 people as of early June, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has also encouraged undocumented migrants to self-deport. Last month, it announced it would offer free airline tickets and a $1,000 incentive to some migrants who chose to leave the U.S. and return to their home countries on their own accord.",
      "Ear said her mother chose to self-deport because \"she wanted to make sure that she was in control of her life.\"",

      "Higuera had crossed into the U.S. illegally when she was only 15 and went straight to work in Los Angeles' garment factories, Ear said. She had intended to stay for just a period of time, earn enough money and then return to Mexico. But then she met her husband and started a family.",
      "\"She's been contributing to the economy, paying taxes every year,\" Ear said. \"There's no benefit for being undocumented, they don't get benefits. She's not going to get a pension.

    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding around 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country, likely setting a record high as the Trump administration aggressively expands nationwide immigration arrests, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "On Monday, June 23, ICE's detention level was \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 at over 140% capacity, since Congress last allocated 41,500 detainee beds for the agency, the figures show.",
      "The federal statistics show nearly half \u2014 or 47% \u2014 of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation.",
      "ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally \u2014 as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses \u2014 while the agency attempts to deport them.",
      "As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers.",
      "Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day.",
      "The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees.",
      "\"If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,\" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system.",
      "The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows.",
      "Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office.",
      "ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records.",
      "But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana.",
      "It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress.",
      "Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds.",
      "Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0Florida would receive federal funds\u00a0to set up those facilities.",
      "Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity.",
      "In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a \"massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States\" has led to \"a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,\" ICE added, noting the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds.",
      "Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population.",
      "\"I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants \u2014 both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,\" Kocher said.",

    "summary": "Almost a dozen Iranian nationals were arrested by immigration agents, in the Trump administration's latest crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest crackdown against illegal immigration, federal agents arrested 11 Iranian foreign nationals in 48 hours, including one watchlisted individual \u2014 part of a series of targeted operations spanning eight states and nine cities nationwide.",
      "Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has \"admitted connections to Hezbollah,\" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.",
      "ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson.",
      "Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety.",
      "While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings.",
      "In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse.",
      "In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and \"shoot officers in the head.\"",
      "ICE officials tell CBS News that the arrests since Sunday are part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on illegal immigration. Federal officials have aimed to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests, with average daily arrests climbing from 660 in President Trump's first 100 days to 1,200 in June \u2014 and the White House says its target is 3,000 arrests per day.",
      "\"We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out \u2014 and we are,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News. \"We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland.\"",
      "According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE \u2014 including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America.",
      "This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel \u2014 though Mr. Trump said Monday\u00a0the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "Current and former intelligence officials caution that America is on high alert for physical or cyber retaliation, telling CBS News that there is a growing concern about the potential for homegrown extremism, including lone attacks inspired by Iranian calls to violence.",
      "On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to \"get in front of\" threats to the U.S. by \"working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities.\"",
      "Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen \"some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back.\" She added, \"We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joints, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen and ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

    "story": [
      "French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, France's blood supply agency announced Friday.",
      "The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed \"Gwada negative,\" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery.",
      "\"The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!\" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn, adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June.",
      "The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems.",
      "Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at the EFS involved in the discovery, told AFP that a \"very unusual\" antibody was first found in the patient in 2011. However, resources at the time did not allow for further research, he added.",
      "Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to \"high-throughput DNA sequencing\", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said.",
      "The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said.",
      "This woman \"is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,\" he said, adding: \"She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself.\"",
      "The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.",
      "The name \"Gwada negative\", which refers to the patient's origins and \"sounds good in all languages\", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard.",
      "The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.",
      "Peyrard and colleagues are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group.",
      "\"Discovering new blood groups means offering patients with rare blood types a better level of care,\" the EFS said.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of a part of Mars that scientists say provide evidence of how water once flowed on the red planet.",
      "There were once rivers, lakes and possibly an ocean on Mars, but they eventually dried up and the planet became the desert it is currently, according to NASA.",
      "The new images by Curiosity show \"dramatic evidence\" of ancient groundwater in crisscrossing low ridges, arranged in \"a boxwork pattern,\" stretching across miles of a mountain on Mars, the space agency said.",
      "\"The bedrock below these ridges likely formed when groundwater trickling through the rock left behind minerals that accumulated in those cracks and fissures, hardening and becoming cementlike,\" NASA said in a news release.",
      "The ridges look like spiderweb patterns from space and had previously only been observed from orbit, NASA said.",
      "\"A big mystery is why the ridges were hardened into these big patterns and why only here,\" Curiosity's project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada, said. \"As we drive on, we'll be studying the ridges and mineral cements to make sure our idea of how they formed is on target.\"",
      "The ridges have small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, left behind by groundwater, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall mountain Curiosity is currently climbing, NASA said.",
      "\"That's really surprising,\" said Curiosity's deputy project scientist, Abigail Fraeman. \"These calcium sulfate veins used to be everywhere, but they more or less disappeared as we climbed higher up Mount Sharp. The team is excited to figure out why they've returned now.\"",
      "Curiosity landed in the planet's Gale Crater in 2012. It has been climbing the foothills of Mount Sharp since 2014, searching for signs of environments that could have supported life, according to NASA.",

      "Strapped into a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, Whitson, test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu roared away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at  2:31 a.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 first stage propelled the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere along a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States.",
      "The booster then fell away and flew itself back to a pinpoint landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to close out its second flight, SpaceX's 467th successful recovery and its 64th in Florida.",
      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA trips to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The climb to orbit went smoothly, and the capsule was released to fly on its own about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. Whitson then revealed the name of the new spacecraft: Crew Dragon Grace.",
      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three private astronaut missions.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",
      "\"Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",

      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",

The front is also bringing rain and a risk of severe storms.",
      "Temperatures soared to 10-20 degrees above average on Wednesday, CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said, with some areas seeing heat index (\"feels like\") readings around 110 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "On Tuesday, at least 50 heat records were matched or broken, and 21 places hit triple-digit temperatures, The Associated Press reported.

      "Meteorologists say it's due to\u00a0a heat dome\u00a0\u2014 an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity \u2014 sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality.",
      "The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say.",

      "How long will the heat wave last?",
      "The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Highs in the 90s continued through Wednesday, and the heat was expected to break on Thursday.",
      "Boston's forecast high for Friday is 34 degrees lower than what it hit on Tuesday.",

      "After one or two days, slightly hotter-than-normal temperatures are forecast, but not anywhere near the highs from earlier this week, Oravec said.",
      "What constitutes a heat wave?",
      "A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly.",
      "Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down.",
      "\"Your body needs a reprieve,\" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. \"You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit.\"",
      "When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees, she said, \"You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality.\"",
      "Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S.",
      "How to stay safe during a heat wave",
      "Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat-related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events.",
      "The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.",
      "If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended. You should also\u00a0stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty.",

    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

    "summary": "The CIA director says \"credible intelligence\" indicates Iran's nuclear program was \"severely damaged.\"",
    "story": [
      "The heads of two key American intelligence agencies issued statements Wednesday on what they said was \"new\" intelligence on the damage resulting from the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, each noting the Iranian program was likely to have been set back by \"years.\"",
      "The statements were released after President Trump decried a leaked, preliminary assessment produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency that said Tehran's nuclear program had only been pushed back by a matter of months.",
      "Mr. Trump had ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities late Saturday, adding to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against targets in Iran.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Wednesday that \"a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes.\"",
      "\"This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\" Ratcliffe's statement said.",
      "It added the agency would continue to collect \"additional reliably sourced information\" to share with policymakers, and, when possible, to provide updates to the public.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to elaborate on the intelligence referenced by Ratcliffe's statement, including the confidence level associated with it or whether it included Israeli or other foreign intelligence.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also wrote on X that \"new intelligence confirms what President Trump has stated numerous times: Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.\"",
      "\"If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan) entirely, which would likely take years to do,\" Gabbard's statement read.",
      "An intelligence official later confirmed to CBS News that the information shared by Gabbard was based on new American intelligence, but declined to specify its confidence level.",
      "Neither of the statements directly addressed some of the questions raised by lawmakers and nonproliferation experts in the aftermath of the strikes about what kinds of residual nuclear capabilities Iran may have retained.",
      "There are also conflicting views about whether Iranian officials had managed to transport enriched uranium away from the sites before they were bombed. The DIA assessment indicated at least some of the enriched uranium had been moved, according to one source familiar with it.",
      "But when asked whether enriched material was successfully moved during a press availability following the NATO summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday, President Trump said, \"We think we hit them so hard and so fast, they didn't get to move.\"",
      "The president also said the U.S. and Iran were expected to hold talks \"next week.\" The format remains unclear, for now, but special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to lead the talks, if they happen, two U.S. officials told CBS News. Witkoff has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister, and recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance have also become more involved in the diplomacy, a U.S. and regional diplomat told CBS News.",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were slated to participate in a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday on the U.S. strikes in Iran, but the session was cancelled and rescheduled for Thursday. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. It is unclear whether both leaders will still participate in both briefings.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard's statements on Wednesday also included criticism of the leak to media outlets of the DIA assessment, which a spokesperson for that agency later said was issued with low confidence and would be refined as additional intelligence becomes available.",
      "The initial DIA report said the entrances to two Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 including the Fordo facility \u2014 were sealed off in the strikes, but that Iran could reconstitute elements of its program once it dug out and made repairs to water and electrical systems, according to sources familiar with it.",
      "The assessment also provided a range of possibilities for how long it could take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume some operations, ranging from a few months to less than a year, one source familiar with the assessment told CBS News.",
      "Administration officials have blasted those findings, which are at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that Saturday night's airstrikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Speaking from the NATO summit, Mr. Trump said the airstrikes set back Iran's program by \"basically decades.\"",
      "\"They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know,\" Mr. Trump said of the U.S. intelligence assessments.",
      "Appearing alongside the president, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday the damage to the sites was extensive.",
      "\"If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you'd better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated,\" he told reporters.",
      "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said in a press availability on Sunday following the strikes that a full battle damage assessment of the strikes \"will take some time.\"",
      "He said at the time that the three targets \"sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",

      "President Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, as a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran holds for now.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace close,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, \"Details will follow.\"",
      "The president said of his conversation with Zelenskyy, \"I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to Vladimir Putin and see if we can get it ended.\"",
      "A Ukrainian BBC reporter, who said her husband is a soldier in Ukraine, asked the president whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, which intercept ballistic missiles.",
      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He said the missiles were \"hard to get,\" and the U.S. has been providing them to Israel. \"They're very effective \u2014 100% effective.\"",
      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",
      "It was a whirlwind trip for Mr. Trump, who arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday and is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Wednesday.",
      "The president said he's leaving NATO with a different perspective about Article 5 \u2014 the agreement that the allies will come to each other's aid when attacked \u2014 after hearing about it directly from fellow leaders.

      "The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be \"helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports.\"",
      "It comes after the FBI has received multiple internal complaints from employees about being pulled off counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to focus on immigration enforcement, according to two other sources who spoke to CBS News. The complaints warned of pressure being placed on FBI agents to \"maximize the number of immigration arrests.\"",

      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",
      "\"I was so naive. I really thought that they would take immediate action, and that they would stop these exposures,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Mississippi has executed the longest-serving man on its death row nearly 50 years after he was convicted of murder.",
    "story": [
      "The longest-serving man on Mississippi's death row was executed Wednesday, nearly five decades after he kidnapped and killed a bank loan officer's wife in a violent ransom scheme.",
      "Richard Gerald Jordan, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder whose final appeals were denied without comment by the U.S. Supreme Court, was sentenced to death in 1976 for killing and kidnapping Edwina Marter. He died by lethal injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman.",
      "The execution began at 6 p.m., according to prison officials. Jordan lay on the gurney with his mouth slightly ajar and took several deep breaths before becoming still. The time of death was given as 6:16 p.m.",
      "Jordan was one of several on the state's death row who sued the state over its three-drug execution protocol, claiming it is inhumane.",
      "When given an opportunity to make a final statement Wednesday, he said, \"First I would like to thank everyone for a humane way of doing this. I want to apologize to the victim's family.\"",
      "He also thanked his lawyers and his wife and asked for forgiveness. His last words were: \"I will see you on the other side, all of you.\"",
      "Jordan's wife, Marsha Jordan, witnessed the execution, along with his lawyer Krissy Nobile and a spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tim Murphy. His wife and lawyer dabbed their eyes several times.",
      "Jordan's execution was the third in the state in the last 10 years; previously, the most recent one was carried out in December 2022.",
      "It came a day after a man was put to death in Florida, in what is shaping up to be a year with the most executions since 2015.",
      "Jordan's execution comes amid an overall uptick in the use of capital punishment in the U.S. since January. Four executions\u00a0were carried out in\u00a0Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina earlier this month.",
      "The Trump administration seeks to resume death row executions at the federal level. President Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term stating, \"capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes.\"",
      "Wednesday's execution was Mississippi's first in three years. Thomas Loden, who pleaded guilty to raping and killing a 16-year-old girl, was executed in December 2022.",
      "Mississippi Supreme Court records show that in January 1976, Jordan called the Gulf National Bank in Gulfport and asked to speak with a loan officer. After he was told that Charles Marter could speak to him, he hung up. He then looked up the Marters' home address in a telephone book and kidnapped Edwina Marter.",
      "According to court records, Jordan took her to a forest and fatally shot her before calling her husband, claiming she was safe and demanding $25,000.",
      "Edwina Marter's husband and two sons had not planned to attend the execution. Eric Marter, who was 11 when his mother was killed, said beforehand that other family members would attend.",
      "\"It should have happened a long time ago,\" Eric Marter told The Associated Press before the execution. \"I'm not really interested in giving him the benefit of the doubt.\"",
      "\"He needs to be punished,\" Marter said.",
      "As of the beginning of the year, Jordan was one of 22 people sentenced in the 1970s who were still on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "His execution ended a decadeslong court process that included four trials and numerous appeals. On Monday the Supreme Court rejected a petition that argued he was denied due process rights.",
      "\"He was never given what for a long time the law has entitled him to, which is a mental health professional that is independent of the prosecution and can assist his defense,\" said lawyer Krissy Nobile, director of Mississippi's Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, who represented Jordan. \"Because of that his jury never got to hear about his Vietnam experiences.\"",
      "A recent petition asking Gov. Tate Reeves for clemency echoed Nobile's claim. It said Jordan suffered severe PTSD after serving three back-to-back tours, which could have been a factor in his crime.",
      "\"His war service, his war trauma, was considered not relevant in his murder trial,\" said Franklin Rosenblatt, president of the National Institute of Military Justice, who wrote the petition on Jordan's behalf. \"We just know so much more than we did 10 years ago, and certainly during Vietnam, about the effect of war trauma on the brain and how that affects ongoing behaviors.\"",
      "Marter said he does not buy that argument: \"I know what he did. He wanted money, and he couldn't take her with him. And he \u2014 so he did what he did.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 18:32:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and federal prosecutors met in court in Nashville on Wednesday for a hearing to discuss the conditions of his release.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was deported back to his home country and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, is set to remain in jail until at least Friday, as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can stop him from being deported if he is released from federal custody pending his trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and federal prosecutors met in court in Nashville on Wednesday for a hearing to discuss the conditions of his release after U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes on Sunday denied a Justice Department request to keep Abrego Garcia detained while awaiting a criminal trial.",
      "After Wednesday's hearing, Holmes ordered Abrego Garcia's lawyers to file court papers laying out their arguments by noon on Thursday, and gave the government until noon on Friday to respond. Holmes said she will issue a ruling at some point after that. Until then, Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals.",
      "In her decision over the weekend, Holmes said Abrego Garcia should be released, with certain conditions. But she noted, and lawyers for both sides acknowledged, that the Salvadoran man would likely be detained by federal immigration authorities for removal proceedings if released on criminal charges.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed Holmes' release order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause that decision.",
      "The judge, Waverly Crenshaw, set a hearing for July 16 to consider the government's bid to revoke the release order.",
      "\"The government emphasizes that absent a stay, it will incur the irreparable injury of Abrego possibly facing deportation from the United States pursuant to the immigration detainer lodged against him by DHS,\" Crenshaw wrote in his decision denying the Justice Department's stay request. \"If deported, the government argues, the Department of Justice will be deprived of the opportunity to pursue its criminal charges against Abrego. At bottom, the government asks the court to save it from itself because it may suffer irreparable harm completely of its own making.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Holmes' acknowledged in her order that Abrego Garcia was likely to remain in custody \u2014 either of the U.S. Marshals or Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 regardless of how she ruled on the detention request, and said her analysis was \"little more than an academic exercise.\" But in a filing with the court, the Justice Department said that a release of Abrego Garcia into custody of immigration authorities \"poses potentially irreparable problems\" for the prosecution of his case and the public.",
      "If the court refuses to pause Holmes' release order and Abrego Garcia is moved to ICE custody and deported, \"the prosecution would lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case,\" prosecutors said, acknowledging that his potential deportation would not be \"instantaneous.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers called the Justice Department's concerns about his potential deportation while awaiting trial a \"possible self-inflicted injury by its executive branch colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case garnered significant public attention after a Trump administration immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" A Salvadoran native, Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has resided in Maryland for more than a decade.",
      "He was placed on a removal flight in March as part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and promise of mass deportations, and sent with hundreds of other migrants to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, however, had been granted a legal status known as withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented the Department of Homeland Security from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because of likely persecution by gangs.",
      "A federal judge in April ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., and that portion of her order was affirmed by the Supreme Court later that month. While the Trump administration resisted efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. for weeks, it finally did so earlier this month so he could face prosecution for alleged human smuggling.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee returned the indictment against Abrego Garcia in late May. The charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when he was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped and said they had been performing construction work in St. Louis, according to body camera footage released by the Highway Patrol.",
      "An April report from the Department of Homeland Security regarding the incident said Abrego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime. He was given a warning citation by the Tennessee officers.",
      "Abrego Garcia was arraigned earlier this month, and Holmes held a hearing to determine whether he should be detained or released ahead of his trial.",
      "In finding that Abrego Garcia should be released, the magistrate judge said that she \"cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego's release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community.\"",
      "Holmes called the government's evidence \"unreliable\" and claims of Abrego Garcia's alleged membership in the gang MS-13 \"simply insufficient,\" as government cooperating witnesses gave an ICE investigator \"conflicting\" information.",
      "The judge said the government put forth \"hearsay statements\" from cooperating witnesses who stand \"to gain something from their testimony in this case.\"",
      "One of the cooperators has two felony convictions, has been deported five times and was released early from a 30-month federal prison sentence for human smuggling for providing information to the government in Abrego Garcia's case, Holmes wrote. He is also the purported \"domestic leader\" of the human smuggling organization that prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia participated in, the judge said.",
      "The second cooperator is an \"avowed member of the human smuggling organization,\" according to the judge, and is in custody charged with a federal crime \"for which he hopes to be released in exchange for\" his testimony before the grand jury. Holmes said the second man has also been deported before and has now requested deferred action on his removal in exchange for his cooperation with the government in Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "Holmes said their statements about Abrego Garcia \u2014 namely regarding his alleged smuggling trips from Maryland to Houston and back \u2014 \"defy common sense.\"",

    "summary": "Federal appeals court nominee Emil Bove, denying a whistleblower's account, says he never told DOJ attorneys to ignore court orders.",
    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department official Emil Bove, who has been nominated for the federal appeals bench, testified before the Senate Wednesday that he never told department attorneys to ignore court orders, denying the account of a whistleblower.",
      "Bove, a former criminal defense attorney who represented President Trump, rejected suggestions by Democrats that the claims of whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, render him unfit to serve on the appeals court. His nomination has come under scrutiny after Reuveni\u00a0said in a complaint made public Tuesday that in one meeting, Bove had used an expletive when saying the Trump administration might need to ignore judicial commands.",
      "\"I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, \"I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.\"",
      "Bove was nominated last month by Mr. Trump to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Mr. Trump's defense team for his New York hush money trial and defended him in the two federal criminal cases brought by the Justice Department.",
      "The White House said Bove \"is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit.\"",
      "\"The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email.",
      "Reuveni, a 14-year veteran of the Justice Department, was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison. He sent a letter on Tuesday to members of Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general seeking an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Bove and other officials in the weeks leading up to his firing.",
      "Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March about Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, citing a claim of a U.S. invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni says Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. He claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and \"ignore any such order,\" his lawyers said in the letter.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called the allegations \"utterly false.\" He said he was at the March meeting, and \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "\"Planting a false hit piece the day before a confirmation hearing is something we have come to expect from the media, but it does not mean it should be tolerated,\" Blanche wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.",
      "Bove has been a central figure in other controversial moves by the Justice Department in recent months, including the order to dismiss New York City Mayor Eric Adams' federal corruption case. Bove's order prompted the resignation of several Justice Department officials, including Manhattan's top federal prosecutor, who accused the department of acceding to a quid pro quo \u2014 dropping the case to ensure Adams' help with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",

    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Adrian Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

      "\"NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Following an assessment of those reports and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\"",
      "In one video posted on social media, a Tesla enters a lane marked on the roadway as being for left turns only, but then goes straight through the intersection and enters an opposing lane for 10 seconds before swerving several times.",
      "The passenger in the car who posted the video, money manager Rob Maurer, minimized the seriousness of the incident. \"There are no vehicles anywhere in sight, so this wasn't a safety issue,\" Maurer said in commentary accompanying his video. \"I didn't feel uncomfortable in the situation.\"",
      "Another video appears to show a robotaxi stopping twice suddenly in the middle of the road, possibly responding to the flashing lights of police cars.",
      "The vehicles were part of a test in Austin of Tesla's Model Y robotaxis. Tesla investors and social media influencers who were invited to participate posted videos on social media over the weekend describing their experience.",
      "The incidents could raise questions about the safety of the cars. Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said in an April earnings call that he expects millions of Tesla's self-driving cars to be on the road by the second half of 2026.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who is bullish on Tesla's future and the market opportunity for its robotaxis, sees such issues as the inevitable growing pains involved in deploying new technology.",
      "\"Any issues they encounter will be fixed,\" Ives told The Associated Press, calling the Austin test a \"huge success.\"",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Musk has said the company's autonomous cars are safer than human-driven vehicles. On a January earnings call, the tech billionaire claimed the safety of the general public and robotaxis' passengers is a \"top priority.\"",
      "The probe into Tesla's robotaxis comes after the NHTSA in October launched an investigation into Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" technology after four of its vehicles were involved in crashes. At the time, Tesla was forced a recall 2.4 million of its vehicles.",
      "Tesla was sued on Tuesday by the estates of three people who were killed during a crash last September involving one of the company's Model S cars, according to\u00a0Reuters.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to pause a judge's order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first providing them due process.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joints, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen and ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

    "summary": "U.S. intel agencies say Iran's nuclear program is in tatters. Israel killed 30 Iranian military commanders. But Iran's supreme leader has a different take on the 12-day war.",
    "story": [
      "\"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" a message posted Thursday on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's X account declared. Another post added the bold claim that Israel's government \"was practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "In a recorded video address to his nation \u2014 his first public remarks since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire with Israel took effect on Tuesday \u2014 Khamenei went further, suggesting a \"large number of military and other targets\" in Israel had been targeted by Iran's missiles.",
      "They may have been targeted, but in reality, Iran's 12 days of missile launches saw relatively few rockets evade Israel's air defenses. A total of 28 people were killed, and none of them have been identified as government officials, but rather civilians killed when missiles struck apartment buildings and cities.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran killed at least 30 military commanders, on the other hand, and, in combination with the U.S. strikes over the weekend, \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear program, according to President Trump. The U.S.-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran, which relies on a network of sources in the country, said Wednesday that the strikes had killed at least 1,054 people in Iran, including a total of 318 military personnel.",
      "While full assessments of the damage inflicted are still being compiled, the heads of two U.S. intelligence agencies said Wednesday that \"new\" intelligence indicated the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was likely set back by \"years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Wednesday that the country's own intelligence assessment showed Iran's nuclear program was put back \"many years.\"",
      "Khamenei had a very different take \u2014 again, offered without any specifics or evidence. He claimed the U.S. had joined in Israel's strikes \"as it felt if it did not do so, the Zionist regime would get totally annihilated, so they entered the war to prevent this.\"",
      "\"They did not manage to do anything important to our nuclear facilities,\" he claimed, adding that Mr. Trump had \"overplayed the whole thing\" and even that Iran had given \"the U.S. a big slap in the face\" by attacking the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is home to thousands of American forces.",
      "But none of the roughly dozen missiles Iran fired at the sprawling base hit it. They were intercepted, despite the ayatollah's assertion of \"lots of damage\" to the site",
      "Anxiety in Iran fueling the ayatollah's dubious claims?",
      "Khamenei's remarks on Thursday were heavy on rhetorical flourish and virtually devoid of any facts, and they may have been aimed more at Iran's people than the wider world.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers, who swept to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled a pro-Western government lead by the royal family of the shah, have long maintained tight control over all media in the country, and many Iranians have little access to outside information.",
      "Still, especially among younger, more tech-savvy generations, there is an understanding of the degree to which Iran's people do not enjoy the freedoms that many other countries guarantee \u2014 and it has led to several popular protest uprisings over the last decade. All of them have been brutally quashed by the authorities, but Netanyahu called very quickly after Israel started bombing Iran for new anti-government protests in the country, urging Iranians to take advantage of the attacks, which he said had put the ayatollah in his weakest position ever.",
      "Khamenei has yet to be seen live or in public since the ceasefire, and his precise whereabouts remained unclear Thursday after the pre-recorded video message was released.",
      "While the ceasefire enabled Israelis to revel on Wednesday in a return to normalcy, with the lifting of 12 days of war-time security measures, in Tehran, anxiety still appeared rife.",
      "CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab and his team were granted Iranian visas to enter the country earlier in the week, and they were the first American broadcast network to enter Tehran since the war began. But it took them an arduous journey through arid landscapes and across the border from Turkey to reach Iran's capital, as the country's airspace had been closed.",
      "Tyab said the Iranian capital felt very different this week compared to his previous visit about five years earlier, when, despite the government's authoritarian control over daily life, it was a vibrant metropolis. On Thursday, despite the truce, most businesses remained shut, and the sense of nervousness was palpable.",

    "story": [
      "Miami \u2014 A former Venezuelan spymaster who was close to the country's late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez pleaded guilty Wednesday to drug trafficking charges a week before his trial was set to begin in a Manhattan federal court.",
      "Retired Maj. Gen. Hugo Carvajal was extradited from Spain in 2023 after more than a decade on the run from U.S. law enforcement, including a botched arrest in Aruba while he was serving as a diplomat representing current Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Carvajal pleaded guilty in court to all four criminal counts, including narco-terrorism, in an indictment accusing him of leading a cartel made up of senior Venezuelan military officers that attempted to \"flood\" the U.S. with cocaine in cahoots with leftist guerrillas from neighboring Colombia.",
      "In a letter this week to defense counsel, prosecutors said they believe federal sentencing guidelines call for the 65-year-old Carvajal to serve a mandatory minimum of 50 years in prison.",
      "Nicknamed \"El Pollo,\" Spanish for \"the chicken,\" Carvajal advised Ch\u00e1vez for more than a decade. He later broke with Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez's handpicked successor, and threw his support behind the U.S.-backed political opposition - in dramatic fashion.",
      "In a recording made from an undisclosed location, Carvajal called on his former military cohorts to rebel a month into mass protests seeking to replace Maduro with lawmaker Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom the first Trump administration recognized as Venezuela's legitimate leader as head of the democratically elected National Assembly.",
      "The hoped-for barracks revolt never materialized, and Carvajal fled to Spain. In 2021, he was captured hiding out in a Madrid apartment after he defied a Spanish extradition order and disappeared.",
      "Carvajal's straight-up guilty plea, without any promise of leniency, could be part of a gamble to win credit down the line for cooperating with U.S. efforts against a top foreign adversary that sits atop the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "Although Carvajal has been out of power for years, his backers say he can provide potentially valuable insights on the inner workings of the spread of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua into the U.S. and spying activities of the Maduro-allied governments of Cuba, Russia, China and Iran.",
      "He may also be angling for President Trump's attention with information about voting technology company Smartmatic. One of Carvajal's deputies was a major player in Venezuela's electoral authority when the company was getting off the ground.",
      "Florida-based Smartmatic says its global business was decimated when Fox News aired false claims by Trump allies that it helped rig the 2020 U.S. election. One of the company's Venezuelan founders was later charged in the U.S. in a bribery case involving its work in the Philippines.",
      "Gary Berntsen, a former CIA officer in Latin America who oversaw commandos that hunted al-Qaeda, sent a public letter this week to Mr. Trump urging the Justice Department to delay the start of Carvajal's trial so officials could debrief the former spymaster.",
      "\"He's no angel, he's a very bad man,\" Berntsen said in an interview. \"But we need to defend democracy.\"",
      "Carvajal's attorney, Robert Feitel, said prosecutors announced in court this month that they never extended a plea offer to his client or sought to meet with him.",
      "\"I think that was an enormous mistake,\" Feitel told The Associated Press while declining further comment. \"He has information that is extraordinarily important to our national security and law enforcement.\"",
      "In 2011, prosecutors alleged that Carvajal used his office to coordinate the smuggling of approximately 5,600 kilograms (12,300 pounds) of cocaine aboard a jet from Venezuela to Mexico in 2006. In exchange, he accepted millions of dollars from drug traffickers, prosecutors said.",
      "He allegedly arranged the shipment as one of the leaders of the so-called Cartel of the Suns - a nod to the sun insignias affixed to the uniforms of senior Venezuelan military officers. The cocaine was sourced by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization and which for years took refuge in Venezuela as it sought to overthrow Colombia's government.",
      "Carvajal \"exploited his position as the director of Venezuela's military intelligence and abandoned his responsibility to the people of Venezuela in order to intentionally cause harm to the United States,\" DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy said. \"After years of trying to evade law enforcement, (he) will now likely spend the rest of his life in federal prison.\"",
      "Carjaval's \"guilty plea demonstrates our commitment to holding accountable foreign officials who abuse their power to poison our citizens,\" U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton was quoted as saying in a Justice Department statement.",

    "summary": "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who led a gang called \"Los Choneros\" in Ecuador, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas Villamar, a fugitive drug trafficker known as Fito and wanted by authorities in Ecuador and the United States, was recaptured more than a year after he escaped from prison in the Andean nation, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced Wednesday.",
      "Mac\u00edas, who led a gang called \"Los Choneros\" in Ecuador, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials in Ecuador said. In April, He was indicted in New York City on charges he imported thousands of pounds of cocaine into the United States.",
      "\"More will fall, we will reclaim the country. No truce,\" Noboa said in an X post announcing Mac\u00edas' arrest. \"We have done our part to proceed with Fito's extradition to the United States, we are awaiting their response.\"",
      "Interpol had issued an arrest warrant for Macias after his mysterious prison escape in early 2024 from the Guayaquil Regional Prison, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking. Ecuadorian authorities have yet to explain how he escaped from one of the country's notoriously violent prisons. They only learned of his escape when a military contingent arrived to transfer him to another maximum-security prison but didn't find him in his cell.",
      "The Ecuadorian army confirmed Macias' recapture in what appeared to be the basement of a house. A video provided by the army showed the moment of the arrest, with a uniformed officer aiming a gun at the head of the drug trafficker, who gave his full name. The officers had found him hiding in a small hole beneath what appeared to be a kitchen counter.",
      "Wednesday's announcement of his arrest comes in the same week that Federico G\u00f3mez, alias \"Fede,\" the leader of another gang called Las Aguilas, was confirmed to have escaped from an Ecuadorian prison.",
      "Last year, U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a news release that Macias led Los Choneros and its \"network of assassins and drug and weapon traffickers\" since at least 2020.",
      "With an extensive criminal record including charges of murder and organized crime, Mac\u00edas has cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public in his home country.",
      "While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to \"the Ecuadorian people\" while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches. He also had been running Los Choneros from his jail cell, authorities allege.",
      "Mac\u00edas' escape \"triggered widespread riots, bombings, kidnappings, the assassination of a prominent prosecutor, and an armed attack on a TV network during a live broadcast,\" the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Ecuador said last year.",
      "The Ecuadorian government and drug mafias also declared war on each other, and Noboa gave orders to \"neutralize\" criminal gangs after\u00a0gunmen stormed and opened fire in the TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces.",
      "The seven-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Mac\u00edas and an unidentified co-defendant with international cocaine distribution, conspiracy and weapons counts, including smuggling firearms from the United States.",
      "Los Choneros employed people to buy firearms, components and ammunition in the United States and smuggle them into Ecuador, according to the indictment. Cocaine would flow into the United States with the help of Mexican cartels.",
      "\"Los Choneros operated a vast network responsible for the shipment and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States and elsewhere,\" the indictment says.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Authorities in Ecuador have classified the gang as a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, the Ecuadorian government announced the reward for the capture of Mac\u00edas would be increased to\u00a0$1 million."

    "story": [
      "The heads of two key American intelligence agencies issued statements Wednesday on what they said was \"new\" intelligence on the damage resulting from the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, each noting the Iranian program was likely to have been set back by \"years.\"",
      "The statements were released after President Trump decried a leaked, preliminary assessment produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency that said Tehran's nuclear program had only been pushed back by a matter of months.",
      "Mr. Trump had ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities late Saturday, adding to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against targets in Iran.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Wednesday that \"a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes.\"",
      "\"This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\" Ratcliffe's statement said.",
      "It added the agency would continue to collect \"additional reliably sourced information\" to share with policymakers, and, when possible, to provide updates to the public.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to elaborate on the intelligence referenced by Ratcliffe's statement, including the confidence level associated with it or whether it included Israeli or other foreign intelligence.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also wrote on X that \"new intelligence confirms what President Trump has stated numerous times: Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.\"",
      "\"If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan) entirely, which would likely take years to do,\" Gabbard's statement read.",
      "An intelligence official later confirmed to CBS News that the information shared by Gabbard was based on new American intelligence, but declined to specify its confidence level.",
      "Neither of the statements directly addressed some of the questions raised by lawmakers and nonproliferation experts in the aftermath of the strikes about what kinds of residual nuclear capabilities Iran may have retained.",
      "There are also conflicting views about whether Iranian officials had managed to transport enriched uranium away from the sites before they were bombed. The DIA assessment indicated at least some of the enriched uranium had been moved, according to one source familiar with it.",
      "But when asked whether enriched material was successfully moved during a press availability following the NATO summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday, President Trump said, \"We think we hit them so hard and so fast, they didn't get to move.\"",
      "The president also said the U.S. and Iran were expected to hold talks \"next week.\" The format remains unclear, for now, but special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to lead the talks, if they happen, two U.S. officials told CBS News. Witkoff has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister, and recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance have also become more involved in the diplomacy, a U.S. and regional diplomat told CBS News.",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were slated to participate in a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday on the U.S. strikes in Iran, but the session was cancelled and rescheduled for Thursday. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. It is unclear whether both leaders will still participate in both briefings.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard's statements on Wednesday also included criticism of the leak to media outlets of the DIA assessment, which a spokesperson for that agency later said was issued with low confidence and would be refined as additional intelligence becomes available.",
      "The initial DIA report said the entrances to two Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 including the Fordo facility \u2014 were sealed off in the strikes, but that Iran could reconstitute elements of its program once it dug out and made repairs to water and electrical systems, according to sources familiar with it.",
      "The assessment also provided a range of possibilities for how long it could take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume some operations, ranging from a few months to less than a year, one source familiar with the assessment told CBS News.",
      "Administration officials have blasted those findings, which are at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that Saturday night's airstrikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Speaking from the NATO summit, Mr. Trump said the airstrikes set back Iran's program by \"basically decades.\"",
      "\"They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know,\" Mr. Trump said of the U.S. intelligence assessments.",
      "Appearing alongside the president, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday the damage to the sites was extensive.",
      "\"If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you'd better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated,\" he told reporters.",

      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",

      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",

      "President Trump praised the new defense agreement, calling it a \"monumental win for the United States\" during a speech at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. Mr. Trump has repeatedly demanded that NATO allies boost their defense spending, arguing that other countries disproportionately rely on the U.S..",

      "Defense spending covers a nation's armed forces, including personnel, equipment, ammunition and more.",

      "Canada, Portugal and Italy each spent an estimated 1.5% of their GDP on defense. Slovenia, Belgium and Luxembourg came in a bit lower.",

    "summary": "Trump says U.S. strikes \"obliterated\" key Iranian nuclear sites, setting the program back decades, but sources say an early intel assessment says Iran could rebuild some of its capabilities in months.",
    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "\"This is a preliminary, low confidence assessment \u2014 not a final conclusion \u2014 and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available,\" a senior DIA official told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We have still not been able to review the actual physical sites themselves, which will give us the best indication.\"",
      "The official added that the agency was \"working with the FBI and other authorities to investigate the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\"",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "He reiterated that assertion Wednesday morning in the Netherlands, where he was attending a NATO summit, telling reporters the \"they're not going to be building bombs for a long time.\"",
      "\"I think that Israel is going to be telling us very soon, because Bibi [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] is going to have people involved in that whole situation. We hear it was obliteration, it a was a virtual obliteration,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he did not believe the Iranians \"had a chance to get anything out\" of their underground nuclear facilities before the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying: \"We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran's military nuclear program, has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. The achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force\u00a0joined Israel's strikes, on President Trump's orders, dropping several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume its work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump blasted reports on the DIA assessment in a Truth Social post, writing, \"THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "In an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the release of the DIA report \"treasonous.\" He said \"we know for a fact\" that the Natanz site was destroyed, and said of the Fordo strike, \"there's no doubt that it was obliterated.\"",
      "Witkoff also said \"it will be almost impossible for them to resurrect that program,\" adding, \"it will take a period of years.\"",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported. Other U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran would need a minimum of six to eighteen months to create a weapon they could deliver with success.",

      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 There was cautious optimism in Israel on Wednesday that the ceasefire with Iran would hold, at least for now. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran. The ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration \u2014 and enforced by President Trump personally on Tuesday as it looked perilously close to failing before it even took hold \u2014 led Israel's Home Front Command to lift restrictions on movement in the country, with Ben Gurion International Airport reopening for commercial flights.",

      "Those claims come despite an initial, classified U.S. military intelligence assessment that shows, according to three sources familiar who spoke with CBS News on Tuesday, that Iran's nuclear capability was only set back by months, and not completely destroyed.",

      "Iran's parliament voted on Wednesday to fast-track a proposal that would effectively halt all cooperation with the IAEA \u2014 cooperation that expanded under the previous international nuclear agreement with Iran, and which has continued despite serious challenges since Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact during his first term. The IAEA's board of governors voted, to Iran's annoyance, just before Israel launched its attacks almost two weeks ago to censure the Islamic Republic for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors.",
      "Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf criticized the IAEA ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying the agency \"refused to even pretend to condemn the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.\" He said for that reason, Iran's domestic atomic energy agency \"will suspend cooperation with the IAEA until security of nuclear facilities is ensured, and Iran's peaceful nuclear program will move forward at a faster pace.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump accused Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire, but then said it was \"in effect\" after a phone call with Israel's leader.",
    "story": [
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to be holding after days of deadly conflict between the Middle East's arch rivals. President Trump said Tuesday that it was \"in effect.\" Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the\u00a0agreement he had announced\u00a0just hours before.",
      "Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect and said it would \"respond forcefully.\"",
      "But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump \u2014 including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 the bombardments ceased.",
      "The State Department announced Tuesday night in a social media post that the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would reopen Wednesday \"as usual,\" adding that all shelter-in-place orders for U.S. government employees had been lifted. However, government employees and their family members were still restricted from traveling  outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva areas.",
      "The State Department noted that Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv was reopening after being shuttered for several days, but that the State Department was also still providing limited evacuation flights for U.S. citizens and green card holders out of Israel.",
      "How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,\" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire would take hold in stages, the president said. A White House official told CBS News that Iran would halt strikes against Israel from midnight Eastern Time, and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that, from noon ET on Tuesday. Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began.",
      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire.",
      "\"I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,\" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel.",
      "\"I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin.",
      "\"Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would \"see if I can stop it.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy with them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?\"",
      "Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu.",
      "A White House source told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"exceptionally firm and direct\" in the call about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire, and the source said Netanyahu had \"understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed.\"",
      "In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"refrained from further attacks\" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches.",
      "Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran",
      "In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on \"the heart of Tehran\" at 3 a.m. local, \"hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces.\"",
      "\"Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,\" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles.",
      "\"At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.\"",
      "At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began.",
      "Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops",

      "Al-Naaman said a \"treacherous and cowardly act of aggression\" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border.",
      "The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations.",
      "The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.",

    "summary": "Ahead of U.S. strikes on Iran, one U.S. intel assessment concluded Iran could build a nuclear weapon in months but didn't assess it decided to do so, intel sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the same day that President Trump ordered Saturday's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in three to eight months \u2014 but there was no indication that it had decided to do so, CBS News has learned.",
      "The intelligence summary, issued Saturday for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, found that Iran could build a nuclear device in months if it did not run into technical or logistical delays, two American intelligence sources familiar with the document told CBS News.",
      "But at that time, the summary did not assess that Iran had made a decision to sprint toward a nuclear weapon \u2014 lining up with U.S. assessments for years.",
      "Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs. The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran \"is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.\"",
      "The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but \"pressure has probably built on him to do so\" \u2014 noting an \"erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public.\"",
      "Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes.",
      "Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was \"wrong\" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following\u00a0 a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time.",
      "Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the Iranian sites targeted in the U.S. strikes were linked to Iran's \"nuclear weaponization ambitions.\" When asked whether the U.S. believed Khamenei had ordered the building of a nuclear weapon, Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant.\"",
      "\"They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" Rubio said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world.\"",
      "\"[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,\" she added.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making \u2014 especially for military combat operations and deployment.\"",
      "\"The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions \u2014which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,\" Parnell said.",

    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",

      "Lawyers on both sides of the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial hammered down instructions Wednesday for the jury to begin deliberations once closing arguments wrap up in the former record executive's federal trial for alleged sex crimes.",
      "Prior to a charge conference, prosecutors indicated in court they are not pursuing a number of allegations against the \"Victory\" rapper that pertain to a racketeering charge.",
      "The updated request from the government more than seven weeks after the trial began gave pause for concern about the status of the case.

      "\"In order to find Diddy guilty of RICO, the jury has to find him guilty of at least two underlying crimes in connection with the alleged criminal enterprise, Bad Boy Entertainment,\" Faddis told Fox News Digital. \"This move by the prosecution significantly limits the underlying crimes the jury can consider in deciding if Diddy is guilty of RICO, thereby reducing the scope of the RICO charge and the case more generally. All things considered, I think it makes it less likely that Diddy will be found guilty of RICO.\"",

      "\"Specifically, the Government has removed instructions from the charge relating to (i) attempted kidnapping under both California and New York law, (ii) attempted arson under California law, and (iii) aiding and abetting sex trafficking. The Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary.\"",
      "The simplified charges could help \"streamline the deliberations and cause the jury to focus\" on only the RICO crimes, Faddis said.",

      "\"On the other hand, it could damage the government\u2019s credibility, as they promised this jury at the beginning of trial that they could prove crimes they now are dismissing,\" Faddis noted. \"The jury might feel misled, see this is a partial surrender and view the remaining allegations with even more skepticism.\"",

      "\"The same applies to the sex trafficking counts. The government is arguing that Diddy sex trafficked the victims, not that he aided and embedded others to do so. The prosecution is just simplifying the charges for the jury to avoid confusion. This doesn't really change anything, and the legal arguments they're going to make during closing will remain the same.\"",

      "Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17.",
      "A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence per charge, the U.S. Code 2421 transportation charge can carry a sentence of up to 10 years and U.S. Code 2422 Coercion and enticement may carry a 20-year sentence. Each of the violations may also include monetary fines.",
      "Diddy was arrested and charged with multiple counts in September. (Shareif Ziyadat)",

      "\"When you look at the indictment, it's very long. It's a speaking indictment, and they have ticked off all of the various facts that they had presented to the jury in that indictment,\" Chutkow said. \"They brought in evidence of violence. They brought in evidence of guns, of drugs, of sex acts. And so they really came through with what they said that they were going to do in this case.\"",
      "Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17.",
      "\"It was savvy to bring this as a racketeering case in some ways because it allowed them to bring in a lot more evidence of his bad acts that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to do if this was a very narrowly tailored case,\" Chutkow said. \"And so in that respect, I mean, the case really rises and falls with the testimony of Cassie Ventura.\"",
      "Chuktow added, \"If the jury believes it, if they believe that she really couldn't get away from him, and she had to do the things that he had requested, then the prosecution has gone a long way toward a conviction in this case.\"",

      "She also claimed it was commonplace for Diddy to become \"physical\" with her in their relationship. She defined\u00a0\"physical\"\u00a0as punishment, beatings and kicking.",
      "Cassie testified that Diddy raped her on the living room floor in 2018, then left. At the time, she had been dating Alex Fine, who is now her husband. Cassie admitted to seeing Combs again after the alleged rape, telling the jury they had been together for 10 years and had a connection. Diddy and Cassie dated on-and-off from 2007 until 2018.",

      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"The trial seems like it will come down to one central question: Were the women coerced or did they voluntarily participate in the prodigious sexual escapades called 'freak offs?'\" Capozzolo told Fox News Digital. \"It would seem that if the jury believes that Cassie Ventura and the other women were coerced, then Combs may likely face a conviction on one or more of the charges.",
      "Cassie Ventura gave emotional testimony while on the stand for nearly a week in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Cassie and Diddy dated for nearly a decade before ending their relationship in 2018. (Amanda Edwards)",
      "\"Given that Combs\u2019 presented no real substantive defense in the case, his fate may depend on how well his attorneys were able to attack the credibility of the women who testified and how well the defense is able to persuade the jury that their claims of coercion are unreliable.\"",
      "He added, \"Defense attorneys will certainly argue that the fact that two of the women who were described as victims did not testify is a lack of evidence the jury can consider in determining if the government proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "For the racketeering charges, Capozzolo questioned if there was an \"actual agreement among the co-conspirators\" to prove the necessary elements of racketeering conspiracy charges.",
      "\"In most racketeering cases, like mob cases, the government calls several co-conspirators, usually cooperators, who get on the stand and admit that they are part of a racketeering conspiracy \u2014 in that they agreed to participate in an ongoing \u2018enterprise\u2019 understanding that its purpose was to commit certain crimes,\" Capozzolo said.",

And some of the people whom the government identifies as key co-conspirators have never been charged, nor have they testified, such as Combs\u2019 former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram.\"",
      "Still, Capozzolo clarified that the government provided compelling evidence to support their case \u2014 which included testimony, videos, photos and text messages \u2014 and will likely \"take great care to marshal the evidence\" when closing arguments begin.",
      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname Jane. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Even if prosecutors fail to convict on the top racketeering charge, the sex trafficking charges carry significant penalties, including a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence,\" Capozzolo said. \"So even a 'compromise' verdict, rather than a straight acquittal, may prove costly to Combs.\"",
      "A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence per charge, the U.S. Code 2421 transportation charge can carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while U.S. Code 2422 Coercion and enticement may carry a 20-year sentence. Each of the violations may also include monetary fines.",
      "Criminal defense and civil attorney\u00a0Adant\u00e9 Pointer of Lawyers for the People LLC told Fox News Digital that while the prosecution may not be able to convince a jury of all charges, even one conviction will cost Diddy.",
      "\"Keep in mind, the prosecution only needs to prove a single charge about one of the several alleged victims in this case for Diddy to be facing significant prison time,\" Pointer told Fox News Digital. \"So essentially, the prosecution only needs to win on a single charge, while Diddy needs to run the table on all the charges to avoid prison time.\"",

      "He added, \"If the defense successfully sows seeds of doubt in a single juror\u2019s mind, then the jury will be unable to reach a unanimous verdict, which is required to convict someone. However, he still faces a substantial challenge on the counts of transportation to engage in prostitution as it relates to the male prostitutes, since federal prosecutors have ample evidence, which appears to be mostly uncontroverted, that Diddy paid and arranged for the sex workers to fly to different locations to engage in sexual activity for money.\"",

      "\"Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case,\" Teny told the court. \"This case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money. This case is about voluntary adult choices made by capable adults and consensual relationships. This case is about those real-life relationships, and the government is trying to turn those relationships into a racketeering case, a prostitution case and a sex trafficking case. It will not work.\"",
      "She noted that Diddy \"has a bad temper\" and at times gets \"so angry or so jealous that he is out of control,\" but she emphasized that the \"Victory\" rapper was not charged with \"being mean.\"",
      "\"He is not charged with being a jerk. He's charged with running a racketeering enterprise,\" Teny said. \"And though there was violence that you are going to hear about, you already have, that violence is not part of any RICO.

      "DIDDY DEFENSE NOT EXPECTED TO CALL ANY WITNESSES IN SEX TRAFFICKING TRIAL",

These drugs \u2013 including MDMA, cocaine and ecstasy \u2013 were then used by Diddy and his ex-girlfriends during the allegedly forced sexual sessions involving male escorts, the prosecution argued.",
      "Cassie Ventura, who dated Diddy from 2007 until 2018, and the rapper's most recent ex-girlfriend both took the stand during the six weeks of testimony. Cassie and Jane, testifying under a pseudonym, claimed they were introduced to \"freaks offs\" or \"hotel nights\" shortly after beginning their relationship with Diddy.",
      "Shapiro noted that evidence showed Diddy attempted to hide the nature of the sexual activity from his staff, who she said, after they learned of the violence, tried to help Cassie and not their employer.",
      "She argued that the government failed to prove two elements to charge Diddy with racketeering, that the person has to offer or give a bribe and also act with corrupt intent. The trial, Shapiro said, confirmed Diddy did not attempt to bribe anyone to prevent them from giving information to authorities. Each witness stated Cassie did not want the police involved, with security corroborating Cassie's refusal to call law enforcement officials.",

She also argued there was insufficient evidence for kidnapping racketeering, and that Mia, his ex-assistant, allegedly faced verbal physical threats, but could have quit. She wanted to continue working for Diddy.",
      "Cassie and Jane both testified they were forced to have sex with male escorts while Diddy watched.

On the other hand, calling a witness can open that person up to questioning and perhaps elicit damaging testimony against Diddy, depending upon their interactions with him and their knowledge of these women.\"",
      "Pointer likened the defense's decision not to call any witnesses to a \"Pandora's box.\"",

      "\"Diddy testifying would just allow the prosecution to retell their case and put the previous items of evidence in front of the jury for a second or third time,\" Pointer explained. \"The prosecution would have a field day going through each and every video, text and witness statement made at trial against him and force Diddy to admit the authenticity of the videos, the receipts and invoices, items recovered at his homes and hotel rooms, and that he was present during the events described in prior testimony.",

      "Duddy's federal trial began May 5 and the case is expected to rest this week. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Further, calling executives at Bad Boy Entertainment would be helpful to distance the corporations from Diddy\u2019s more personal behavior, to dispel the criminal enterprise element.

      "\"It's a real big gamble to testify in a case like this where the prosecution has brought racketeering charges, which allows them to bring this wealth of bad acts evidence there,\" Chutkow said. \"By taking the stand, he would just subject himself to even more bad acts that were prohibited by the court. And so that was probably the right call.\"",

You have enough now to know that there's reasonable doubt in this case, and that's why we didn't bring a case.'

      "Cassie Ventura testified in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",

      "\"The prosecution has put in all the evidence. It wasn't excluded. The defense, though, has done a nice job in the cross-examinations,\" he said. \"They've brought in a lot of additional communications between Diddy and these other women to show that the relationship is a lot more complex.",
      "\"One of the things I think the prosecution is going to have to do at the closing argument is to basically say, 'Look, this is not like a trafficking case that you would see on television.

      "HERE'S WHY 90% OF AMERICANS DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT, ACCORDING TO EXPERT",
      "\"When you start exercising, you're under stress and your CO2 starts to rise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"So the more comfortable you are with carbon dioxide in your system, the more adaptable to stress your body is.\"",
      "Breath is like the \"steering wheel\" of the nervous system.",
      "Anderson said breath is like the \"steering wheel\" of the nervous system, as breathing through the nose promotes longer exhalations and relaxes the body.",
      "\"Your nose [also] produces nitric oxide, which you breathe down into your lungs. That expands your blood vessels and relaxes your cardiovascular system,\" he said. \"Top to bottom, it calms your body down. That's why it impacts sleep in such a positive way.\"",
      "Some experts encourage using alternative tapes that do not cover the entire mouth for a less intense experience. (Dream Performance & Recovery)",
      "Some claim that using the tape could also help achieve a more defined jaw structure and could protect dental health, Anderson noted, as mouth breathing leads to dryness and more acidity, which can break down tooth enamel.",

      "She added there is \"no strong evidence\" that mouth taping changes jaw shape.",
      "For those who have nasal congestion, blockages or allergies, Troxel and Anderson agreed that mouth taping is not recommended, as it can make it harder to breathe at night.",

      "One big concern is that using mouth tape may delay or prevent people from getting proper treatment for sleep apnea, a doctor warned. (iStock)",

      "For those who do decide to try it, Troxel suggested testing the tape on the skin first to check for irritation, using medical-grade tape, or considering a tape with a slit so that the mouth is not fully covered.",
      "Anderson added that consumers should consider where the mouth tape is made and what adhesive is used, to prevent skin irritation and allergic reactions.",

      "\"To that end, I found Justice Thomas's concurrence on medical care for transgender youth quite illuminating.

      "\"No longer may this liberty be denied,\" Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. \"The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry.\"",
      "The June 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges ensured same-sex couples were guaranteed the same protections and benefits as their heterosexual peers.",
      "However, the ruling is not without its detractors. In fact, 10 years after the high court's decision, recent polling shows that public opinion on same-sex marriage is more divided than ever.",

      "The 10-year anniversary of Obergefell also comes at a tense political moment. The White House and Congress are governed, as of January 2025, by a new conservative majority \u2014 sidelining progressives and emboldening at least some Republican lawmakers who have signaled interest in challenging the Supreme Court's landmark decision.",

      "In fact, the number of married, same-sex couples in the U.S. has more than doubled since 2015, according to data from the Williams Institute at UCLA's College of Law.",
      "In the decade since the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Obergefell, public support for same-sex marriage has continued to climb, driven in large part by support from Democrat and Independent voters, though voters across all parties and demographics have seen an uptick, according to data from Gallup surveys over the past 10 years.",
      "Nearly 7 in 10 U.S. voters, or 68% of Americans, said this year that they support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll conducted last month \u2014 an 8% increase compared to the 60% majority who said the same in 2015.",
      "Buoyed by popular support, then-President Joe Biden codified same-sex marriage protections at the federal level in 2022 by signing the Respect for Marriage Act, which required the federal government to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages performed in states where they are legal.",

      "It is unclear what exactly prompted the shift. However, at least some Republican lawmakers in state legislatures across the country have urged the high court, via symbolic resolutions, to revisit Obergefell and change the nationwide right to same-sex marriage.",
      "In fact, state legislatures in 2024 introduced more than 500 \"anti-LBGT\" bills, according to the ACLU. Though few of those bills were passed, supporters of same-sex marriage fear that backlash is growing to LGBTQ+ protections \u2014 and suggesting it could be an indicator of future opposition \u2014 preempting a legal challenge to Obergefell that could, eventually, make its way back to the Supreme Court.",

      "Justices sent shock waves through the nation in 2022 when they overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. The decision also sparked renewed fears that the high court could revisit same-sex marriage protections.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, for his part, explicitly suggested the court should do so in his concurring majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson, the case that overturned Roe, writing that the court has \"a duty to 'correct the error' established\" in Obergefell and other similar cases.",

      "Skrmetti was one of the most closely watched cases of the Supreme Court\u2019s term, and advocates for LGBTQ+ organizations such as the ACLU and Lamda Legal, which argued the case in December, have cited fears that the decision could serve as a legal pretext for future cases involving LGBTQ+ protections \u2014 including whether sexual orientation qualifies as a \"protected class\" on par with race or national origin.",

      "\"My guess is that, if they get another case that's really about transgender adults,\" they might be willing to see the \"technical differences\" between them \u2014 which he said could carve out room for the justices to distinguish themselves from other conservatives on the court.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani propelled himself to the top of the Democratic mayoral ticket in NYC through promises to reshape the city through policies deemed by some as too radical.",
    "story": [
      "Former New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo applauds rival and democratic socialist Zohran Mandami for winning New York Citys Democratic Party mayoral primary",
      "A relative unknown until now, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani propelled himself to a stunning upset victory in New York City's Democratic primary after running on a platform that included a laundry list of far-left agenda items, including government spending, tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy and a slew of other policy positions deemed by both Republicans and Democrats as radical.",
      "Chief among his campaign promises has been his vow to redirect tax funds away from subsidies to private grocery chains to create a network of city-owned grocery stores, which he says will be \"focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit.\"",
      "In a TikTok video, Mamdani said that his city-run grocery stores will \"operate without a profit motive,\" instead of focusing on \"price gouging\" as he alleged some private stores do. He claimed that without having to pay rent or property taxes, these city-run stores will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and be able to offer New York residents lower prices than privately owned stores in the city.",
      "\"Grocery prices are out of control,\" he said in the video. \"The job of city government isn\u2019t to tinker around the edges while 1 in 4 children across our city go hungry.\"",

      "Another central tenet of Mamdani\u2019s campaign has been his vow to crack down on \"bad landlords\" by having the city take control of properties when a landlord refuses to make repairs or \"demonstrates consistent neglect\" of their tenants. He also believes he can fix New York City\u2019s affordable housing crisis by immediately freezing the rents of the over two million New York residents who live in rent-stabilized apartments.",
      "To address the city\u2019s safety crisis, Mamdani has said he will create a new government agency called the Department of Community Safety (DCS) that he says will utilize \"evidence-based strategies that prevent violence and crime before they occur.\" Among the new agency\u2019s top priorities, as stated by Mamdani in a campaign video, will be to expand gun violence programs, address hate and tackle homelessness. The agency would also deploy mental health workers to subways and trouble spots, which he said \"will make all of us safer.\"",
      "He has also pledged to institute universal free childcare for children aged 6 weeks to 5 years as well as to raise wages for childcare workers to be on par with public school teachers.",

      "Other priorities include his pledge to champion a law to raise the minimum wage in New York City to $30 an hour by 2030 and expanding funding for hate violence prevention programs by 800%.",
      "Another major tenet of Mamdani\u2019s platform is \"Trump-proofing\" New York City. He made headlines in March when authorities had to hold him back while he yelled and verbally berated Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan, who was visiting the New York state Capitol building.",
      "His website states that President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement, tariffs and other policies are \"tearing at the fabric of New York City.\"",
      "Mamdani\u2019s website states that he will strengthen the city\u2019s sanctuary city apparatus by kicking ICE out of all city facilities and ending any cooperation with the agency, as well as increasing legal support for immigrants and shielding their personal data.",
      "His website further states that, as mayor, Mamdani will make New York City an LGBTQ+ sanctuary city and protect \"reproductive rights.\"",
      "NEW YORK DEMOCRATS SAY MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI 'TOO EXTREME TO LEAD'",
      "Perhaps even more controversial, however, are the policy positions Mamdani has previously advocated for but has not made central parts of his campaign.",
      "During his campaign, Mamdani attempted to justify the use of the phrase \"globalize the intifada\" and stayed firm in his support for the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions effort against Israel, calling it a \"legitimate movement.\"",
      "He has previously called to defund the New York Police Department, though he has since stated that \"police have a critical role to play.\" Following the death of George Floyd, Mamdani tweeted on June 8, 2020, that he did not want to reform the police but asserted, \"We want to defund the police.\"",
      "In another tweet later that month, Mamdani wrote, \"We don\u2019t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD \u2026 NO to fake cuts \u2013 defund the police.\"",
      "In November 2020, Mamdani again tweeted, \"queer liberation means defund the police.\"",
      "In 2020, Mamdani also called for the prison system to be dismantled, saying that it is a system that cages and kills those just trying to \"survive.\"",

      "\"As socialists, we believe people should not have to endure violence & coercion of a criminal-legal system that props up the exploitation of the market by surveilling, caging & killing those fighting to survive under capitalism,\" he said, adding, \"We can abolish that system.\"",
      "He called on the New York state assembly to fight the construction of any new prisons and instead invest those funds in communities \"that have been impacted by mass incarceration.\"",
      "Again in 2021, he said, \"Our prison system relies on dehumanization and brutality, so the goal must be to abolish this exploitative system entirely. We must #DecarcerateNow.\"",
      "Mamdani also called to abolish private health insurance and medical bills, saying, \"This is no time to put the ideology of capitalism above helping those who are in the greatest need.\"",
      "In addition to calling for less policing and less incarceration, Mamdani also tweeted in 2022 that \"we need to ban all guns.\"",
      "He has further called for legislation to decriminalize sex work, permit \"safe injection sites\" for drug use, re-enfranchise convicts and end all cooperation with ICE.",
      "Following Mamdani\u2019s victory over Cuomo on Tuesday night, many are now expressing alarm that his policy proposals could come to fruition if he is unable to unseat the sitting Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for reelection as an independent.",

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian migrant who was erroneously deported to El Salvador before being returned to the U.S. earlier this month to face prosecution, was ordered to be placed into the custody of his brother should he be released from custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Abrego Garcia appeared in federal court on Wednesday after the Trump administration challenged a federal judge's orders to release him pending criminal trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said Sunday that the government failed to prove its case during an arraignment hearing earlier this month that Abrego Garcia was a \"serious risk\" of fleeing or obstructing justice if he were to be released pending trial for the criminal charges.",

      "Abrego Garcia is expected to remain in U.S. Marshal's custody until Holmes decides if she can assign a holding facility. Her decision will likely come after both the defense and prosecution submit their opinions to the court.",
      "During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Holmes ordered that Abrego Garcia be placed in home detention, in the custody of his brother, if he is released by ICE. If that were to happen, Abrego Garcia will be tracked using location monitoring, such as an ankle monitor.",
      "Under the conditions of release, Abrego Garcia will not be required to pay cash bail. He also cannot violate state or federal law, must cooperate in giving DNA samples, and cannot change any of his contact information, including his telephone number.",

      "Additionally, he is required to enroll in anger management counseling, cannot possess firearms or have them in his residence, is not allowed to use drugs without a prescription, cannot have contraband, must remain in contact with law enforcement and cannot communicate with any members of MS-13, Tren de Aragua or any other gangs.",
      "Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. denied the government\u2019s request for a stay on Holme\u2019s order to release Abrego Garcia. In his decision, Crenshaw said the government did not make the \"strong showing\" required to justify the grant of stay.",

      "Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador in March was the result of what officials acknowledged was an administrative error. Still, it kicked off a months-long court fight to secure his release and return to U.S. soil, despite a federal court order, and a Supreme Court ruling ordering the administration \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S., which the government eventually did after months of delay and threats from a federal judge in Maryland to pursue potential contempt proceedings.",

      "\"It's a question for our own party of: How do we move forward?\" Mamdani said on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\" \"Do we move forward with the same politicians of the past, the same policies of the past that delivered us this present, or do we move forward with a new generation of leadership, one that is actually interested in serving the people?\"",

      "Cybernews describes the exposed database as a \"blueprint for mass exploitation.\" The records include login credentials from popular platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials. So, even if your account wasn't part of a recent breach, you could still be at risk if your old credentials are part of this newly indexed compilation.",

      "With credential leaks becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

Millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, harming hundreds of species, including nearly half of all marine animals. BeBot's gentle cleaning process reduces these threats without disturbing sensitive habitats or compressing turtle eggs. Cleaner beaches lead to healthier ecosystems and better experiences for visitors. Because BeBot operates quietly and efficiently, it is ideal for popular tourist destinations where traditional machinery would be disruptive or damaging.

    "summary": "A new ClickFix campaign targets macOS users with fake Spectrum support sites, tricking victims with CAPTCHA failures to paste commands that install information-stealing malware.",
    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "Fake Captcha on a Mac. (CloudSEK)",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Even experienced users can be tricked when malicious behavior is disguised as routine. The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

      "Trucking is a $2 trillion freight market in the U.S. and Europe alone, and it faces some serious headwinds. There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical. It has already been tested over five million miles across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, gathering real-world data to make its AI smarter and more reliable with every trip.",
      "Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.",

      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",

      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out.

      "3) Be wary of free health quizzes and symptom checkers:\u00a0If a site asks for personal details in exchange for \"insights,\" assume it\u2019s monetizing your answers. Consult your doctor, not a clickbait quiz.",
      "4) Limit data sharing beyond healthcare providers:\u00a0Only provide necessary information when signing up for health-related services or apps. Be wary of sharing health details on social media or in public forums, as these can be scraped by data brokers.",
      "5) Request data minimization from providers:\u00a0Ask your healthcare providers to collect and store only the minimum amount of personal information necessary for your care, reducing the risk if their systems are compromised.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus software: Strong antivirus software acts as a shield, protecting your devices from malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats that could compromise your personal health data. Choose a reputable solution that offers real-time threat detection, regular updates, and robust protection for all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "7) Regularly update your software:\u00a0Cyber threats targeting health data are constantly evolving, and outdated software can leave your devices vulnerable to attacks that expose your sensitive information. Keeping your operating system, apps, antivirus, and security tools\u00a0up to date ensures you have the latest protections against malware, ransomware, and other exploits that data brokers or hackers might use to access your health information. Regular updates patch security holes before they can be exploited, helping to prevent breaches like those that have exposed millions of Americans' health details in recent years.",
      "8) Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0Your health data is often protected by passwords on apps, portals, and devices. Using strong, unique passwords for each account reduces the risk that a single breach could give someone access to multiple sources of your personal information. Avoid common or reused passwords, and consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This step is crucial because once your login credentials are compromised, data brokers or cybercriminals can gather and sell your health-related data, leading to privacy violations, discrimination, or targeted scams. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your health should be personal, but in today's digital world, that privacy is constantly under threat. Even if you're cautious, your health-related information can be collected, analyzed, and sold without your clear consent. The good news is that you can take real steps to reduce your exposure and protect what matters. This isn't about fear; it's about staying informed and taking control of your digital footprint.",

      "Forerunner K2 \"Bumblebee\" humanoid robot at the SAIC-GM automotive plant. (Kepler Robotics)",
      "Addressing concerns about job displacement",
      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

If your web browser automatically populates your username and password for you, make sure this information is free of typos.",

      "4. Use a static IP address.\u00a0Some accounts attempt to recognize your device through your IP address. If you have a dynamic IP address, your IP address changes constantly, meaning the account may not recognize your device, triggering the reset message. This often occurs because you are using a VPN. See if your VPN allows you to use a static IP address.",

      "2. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft, credential stuffing, phishing and spam.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): Enabling\u00a02FA is one of the most effective ways to stop unauthorized access, even if someone has your password. When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",
      "4. Install strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to catch malware before it causes harm. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Review your account settings: Make sure your recovery phone number and email are current. Remove any outdated or unused backup methods.",
      "6. Keep your software up to date: Keep your device software and apps\u00a0up to date to patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit.",
      "7. Use a VPN to protect your online activity: Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a VPN to protect your information when browsing on unsecured networks. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "Cyberattacks on financial service providers are no longer isolated events. In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from Optima data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",

      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028.

      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",

Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand. Whether AI ends up helping or hurting the climate may depend on how quickly clean energy breakthroughs catch up and how honestly we measure progress.",

      "After strikes on Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites by U.S. forces Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning of the heightened risk of domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or domestic attackers.",

      "Sleeper cells are groups planted within a country by a foreign government to live and work among citizens with the ultimate goal of eventually carrying out a terror attack or politically motivated act of violence.",
      "Due to depleted funding and resources, terror organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas have been forced to \"sit this one out\" when it comes to aiding Iran in its attacks, significantly depleting the regime\u2019s show of force when looking to retaliate against the U.S. and Israel, according to Barak Seener, a senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Society.",

      "\"Iran will be seeking to flex by activating sleeper cells in the U.S., Britain, Europe or even Asia,\" Seener said. \"[It\u2019s] about conducting surveillance and then targeting either community centers or policy officials. So, Iran is not new to this game.\"",
      "The threat to Americans\u2019 safety has U.S. officials on high alert, and DHS and the FBI are ramping up security measures throughout the country. Since the bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites over the weekend, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 11 Iranian nationals in the country illegally, including an alleged sniper in the Iranian army,\u00a0according to DHS.",

      "\"It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"The ongoing Israel-Iran conflict brings the possibility of increased threat to the homeland in the form of possible cyberattacks, acts of violence and antisemitic hate crimes.\"",

      "However, Seener also raised the possibility of Iranian operatives commandeering anti-Israel campus protests throughout the U.S. while using cyber warfare to launch disinformation campaigns on social media.",
      "\"Much of the opposition to U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and Gaza has been people that have been coming to the [country] on student visas,\" Seener said. \"They\u2019re not U.S. nationals. And, yet, they\u2019re able to create a disturbance and contribute to an enormous disruption.\"",

      "While the bulletin released by DHS does not cite any specific threats to the American people, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the country are on high alert as they encourage people to remain vigilant with tensions between the U.S. and Iran continuing to rise.",
      "\"There are no rules of engagement to a rogue regime like Iran,\" Seener said. \"Everything is fair game. Western democracies don\u2019t operate in that manner, and it\u2019s alien to us, but that is how Iran operates.\"",

      "The Monday evening announcement took effect 12 hours later, following a timeline designed to allow final military maneuvers on both sides. However, a barrage of Iranian missile fire in the hours that followed left many Israelis questioning whether the truce had already been violated.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, said such delayed implementation is not unusual. \"It\u2019s hard to turn things off on a switch. You have aircraft in flight. You have forces in position,\" he explained.",

      "\"What\u2019s historic is that the U.S. carried out a limited operation on nuclear targets with zero losses\u2014no pilot, no equipment\u2014and helped Israel in a way only America could. Nuclear proliferation is nonpartisan, and this was an apolitical win.\" Even after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar, he added, \"the President showed immense restraint and kept focus on the broader goal: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continuing its terror campaign.\"",
      "Despite the violence that followed the announcement \u2014 including an Iranian strike that killed four civilians in Israel \u2014 Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold. \"Both countries have now said we\u2019re absolutely going to do it,\" he said. \"And yes, President Trump is very atypical in the way he communicates with the ceasefire\u2026 with the \u2018don\u2019t drop a single bomb.\u2019\"",

      "Even more recently, during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, ceasefires were often brief and symbolic. \"Putin said, \u2018I want three days so I can do my parade,\u2019\" Spencer remarked, highlighting how temporary pauses can serve both strategic and political needs.",

      "Despite the lack of formal terms or international enforcement, Spencer believes the agreement created a new precedent. \"This established a new doctrine,\" he said, citing Israel\u2019s ability to dominate Iranian skies and the U.S. response to nuclear proliferation threats. \"If Iran decides to rebuild some sites somewhere, the threats will be more present than ever.\"",

      "\"What has largely remained intact is Iran\u2019s short-range capability,\" said Blaise Misztal, vice president of policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). \"These are thousands of rockets, missiles, and drones that can\u2019t reach Israel, but can absolutely hit U.S. bases in Qatar, Iraq, Bahrain, and the UAE. That\u2019s what we saw in the strike on Al Udeid.\"",
      "Misztal added that Iran\u2019s remaining arsenal is \"well-developed and available in far greater quantities\" than its long-range weapons. \"The danger isn\u2019t just to U.S. forces. Iran can still target energy infrastructure, major cities, and commercial shipping across the Gulf.\"",

They can\u2019t do it all.\"",
      "\"Iran remains the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror,\" Misztal added, \"They\u2019ve plotted assassinations on U.S. soil before. They\u2019ve carried out attacks globally,\" Misztal said. \"And they\u2019ve invested heavily in cyber since the Stuxnet attack in 2010.

      "In a statement released one week ahead of the summit, NATO said the \"Heads of State and Government are expected to agree [to] a new defense investment plan\" after months of speculation the alliance could increase its spending commitments from 2% of a nation\u2019s GDP to 5%.",
      "The notion was first pushed by Trump after he won the election, and despite the sticker shock of what that could mean for not only the eight nations not yet hitting the 2% commitment, but also the U.S. which currently spends 3.38%, many European leaders got on board.",
      "Fox News Digital has not been able to confirm if NATO will increase its commitment to 5%, and some sources with knowledge of the discussions have suggested that figure could be closer to 3.5% over a period of up to 10 years. On Friday, it was announced that Spain was given an opt-out of paying 5%, instead, it will pay 2.1%, according to a report in the Associated Press.",
      "\"The real focus will be the new defense spending target,\" Peter Rough, senior fellow and director for the Center on Europe and Eurasia with the Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"5% of gross domestic product as a top-line number \u2013 however, only 3.5% must be devoted to hard defense.",

      "\"And 1.5% can count toward adjacent categories, like cybersecurity or infrastructure for military mobility,\" he explained ahead of his testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the NATO summit.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has been an ardent supporter of increasing defense spending, particularly as Europe continues to face its greatest threat since World War II.",
      "Earlier this month, ahead of a NATO ministerial meeting that served as a walk-up to the NATO summit, Rutte said leaders \"will strengthen our deterrence and defense by agreeing ambitious new capability targets.\"",

      "The issue of defending Ukraine is once again expected to be a top agenda item and has been a driving force in motivating the NATO alliance to drastically increase spending, which nations under the alliance first did following Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "However, given Trump\u2019s consistent push for increased NATO defensive spending, his threats to withdraw troops from Europe and his insistence that Kyiv not be allowed to join the 32-member alliance, Ukraine\u2019s defense may not play as big of a front-and-center role this year.",
      "\"There won\u2019t be nearly as much focus on Ukraine as during the past few summits,\" argued Rough. \"The White House is laser-focused on the defense investment pledge, and none of the other allies want to rock the boat.\"",
      "While nations like France, the UK and Germany have taken more direct leadership positions and ardently pledged their continued support for Ukraine, they have also toed the line when it comes to managing transatlantic relationships with Washington under Trump.",

      "The precise damage inflicted on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and the viability of its broader program have become politically charged issues, with Trump and his deputies denouncing the leak of the DIA report and the news outlets that reported it. Democratic lawmakers have accused the White House of possibly overstating the effect of the strikes.",
      "Ratcliffe said on social media that the CIA\u2019s findings were based on \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d and that they contradicted what he called \u201cillegally sourced public reporting regarding the destruction of key Iranian nuclear facilities.\u201d",

Tehran may have moved the uranium soon after the first bombing raids by Israel, Grossi said.",
      "Before Ratcliffe released his statement, Trump dismissed the DIA assessment as inconclusive and premature and said repeatedly that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and nuclear program had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d",

      "Among U.S. adults, 45% oppose the airstrikes, versus 38% who support them. An additional 18% of Americans said they neither support nor oppose the strikes, illustrating how fluid the situation is.",
      "While this survey was in the field from Monday through Wednesday, Iran launched a retaliatory missile barrage at a U.S. military site in Qatar. Trump then announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, chastised both countries for appearing to break the terms and then congratulated them for stopping attacks. Meanwhile, questions still remain about the ultimate consequences of the U.S. strikes, including exactly what damage they did to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Support for the airstrikes divided predictably along partisan lines. Among Democrats, 77% oppose the airstrikes, with 61% strongly opposed. In a near-mirror image, 78% of Republicans support the airstrikes, with 60% strongly supporting them.",
      "Independents are much more divided, with 45% opposing the airstrikes, 21% supporting and 34% who neither support nor oppose the move \u2014 almost twice the share of the overall population who took the neutral position.",
      "The lead-up to the strikes last week exposed a split in the Republican Party between those with isolationist tendencies in the MAGA wing of the GOP and those with more hawkish, traditionalist Republican Party foreign policy positions. A testy exchange between right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz illustrated the divide, with Carlson forcefully arguing that attacking Iran would betray the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d promises.",
      "But while there is a split among Republicans in the poll, it is an exact inversion of the public debate between prominent pro-Trump figures.",
      "While all Republican factions support the airstrikes, respondents who identify with the MAGA movement are significantly more supportive of the strikes than those who identify as traditional Republicans. Though there are some high-profile dissenters on Iran within the MAGA movement, the rank and file of the movement is firmly in favor of the strikes.",
      "Fully 84% of Republicans who identify with the MAGA movement support the strikes, including 70% who strongly support them. In contrast, 72% of Republicans who identify themselves more as supporters of the party support the strikes, with 49% strongly supporting them.",
      "What happens next",
      "While more Americans oppose the airstrikes than support them, a majority (60%) also support a continuation in military action if Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains intact. Initial intelligence assessments indicate that the strikes only set Iran\u2019s nuclear program back three to six months, though it will take more time to make a final assessment. Trump and his administration have pushed back against those conclusions.",
      "Overall, 26% of Americans say that the U.S. should consider all options for future military action, including the use of ground troops. A slightly higher 34% say they support continued military operations, but only through airstrikes. The remainder of Americans (41%) believe the U.S. should not take further military action in Iran.",
      "The question of how to proceed with military action in Iran also splits the Democratic coalition, with a large divide between those who identify themselves more as supporters of the party versus those who identify themselves more as supporters of the progressive movement.",
      "Among progressives, 75% say the U.S. should not take any further military action in Iran. Meanwhile, supporters of the traditional wing of the Democratic Party are nearly evenly split, with 54% saying that no further action should be taken, and 45% supporting some degree of further action if Iran maintains its nuclear program. Nearly one-fifth \u2014 19% \u2014 of  traditional Democrats believe that the U.S. should consider all options, including the use of ground forces.",
      "Tempering this support for continued military action in Iran is a deep concern about the conflict escalating into a broader regional conflict in the Middle East. A full 78% of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about the conflict escalating. This includes 55% of Republicans, 83% of independents and 95% of Democrats.",
      "The role of Congress",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have questioned the legality of Trump\u2019s decision to launch the military strikes on Iran. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., called the strikes unconstitutional, and he had joined with Democrats to introduce a bipartisan resolution before the attacks to block such action without congressional authorization. (He later said that the cessation of hostilities after the strikes would remove the need for a vote on the resolution.)",
      "A majority (60%) of Americans say that Trump should have received congressional authorization before launching the strikes.",
      "While responses to this question were deeply divided along partisan lines, 19% of Republicans agreed that Trump should have received congressional approval first. And 92% of Democrats agreed with the need for authorization, as did 71% of independents.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will hold a \"major\" news conference at Thursday morning \"in order to fight for the dignity of our great American pilots,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Iran says it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, and it had been complying with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which most experts said was successful in limiting its program, until that was effectively axed by Trump in 2018.",
      "After that, Iran began enriching uranium to much higher grades, more than needed for energy and approaching the potency required for a bomb, the IAEA said.",
      "Grossi also called it \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that Iran is reportedly considering pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",

      "On June 4, the Justice Department sued Texas over the Texas Dream Act, then quickly filed a joint motion with Texas asking a judge to declare the law unconstitutional and permanently enjoin Texas from enforcing the law. The same day, the judge did.",
      "Outside organizations sought to invalidate the ruling Tuesday, arguing that the Justice Department and Paxton\u2019s office \u201ccolluded to secure an agreed injunction\u201d and engaged in improper \u201clegal choreography\u201d to obtain their desired outcome.",
      "Speaking at the Republican Attorneys General Association a day after the quick court victory, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli seemed to confirm that.",
      "\u201cSo just yesterday, we had filed a lawsuit against Texas, had a consent decree the same day, or consent judgment, and it got granted hours later,\u201d Kambli told participants, according to audio obtained by NBC News. \u201cAnd what it did was, because we were able to have that line of communication and talk in advance, a statute that\u2019s been a problem for the state for 24 years, we got rid of it in six hours.\u201d",
      "Kambli, who previously worked for Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, added that the Justice Department has \u201cgood relationships\u201d with state attorneys general, which allows it to \u201cget things done.\u201d",
      "Kambli also said the second Trump administration \u201cis learning how to be offensive-minded,\" according to the audio.",
      "\u201cI think that was the biggest critique the first time around in the first Trump administration \u2014 there were a lot of missed opportunities to wield federal government power for the things that we value that just never happened,\u201d Kambli said. \u201cBut this time we\u2019ve brought in a lot of people from state AG world that have done that kind of litigation, know how to do it and have been doing it.\u201d",
      "Paxton's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not dispute that Kambli made the statements and said it was \u201cpretty standard\u201d for Justice Department lawyers to notify state attorneys general of federal lawsuits ahead of time. He cited a Justice Department policy that providing fair warning to state attorneys general before filing lawsuits could \u201cresolve matters prior to litigation.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department filed the lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor, a George W. Bush nominee in the Wichita Falls Division in the Northern District of Texas whose court has become a destination for conservative litigants seeking favorable outcomes.",

They argued that the sequence of events \u201ccompels one conclusion: the United States and the Texas Attorney General colluded to predetermine the outcome of the case.\u201d",
      "The motion added: \u201cThe founders did not design our adversarial system for shadowboxing between co-parties. The system demands opposition, argument, and deliberation \u2014 not consent decrees masquerading as litigation.\"",
      "Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, criticized Paxton for not defending the bipartisan Texas Dream Act, which the Legislature passed and Gov. Rick Perry signed more than two decades ago. She noted that the Legislature had declined to repeal the law.",
      "Paxton recently announced that he is going to challenge U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the Republican primary next year \u2014 a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cInstead of defending the law of Texas ... Attorney General Paxton colluded with the Trump-Vance administration to try to eliminate the law through the courts,\u201d Perryman said in a statement. \u201cThis maneuver is a misuse of the courts. If Attorney General Paxton will not defend Texans, we will. We are committed to ensuring that this cynical move is opposed, to defending the Texas Dream Act, and to supporting the courage of our clients.\u201d",
      "Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said the heads of the Texas House and Senate should be concerned that Paxton\u2019s office declined to defend a state law.",
      "\"The whole American premise of settling a case is that you have people who have conflicting interests and that's why they're in court to begin with,\" Tobias said. \"But of course, we know for political reasons, they're probably not.\"",

      "\"Part of the reason why they're more willing to do that is a political reason, that they want to be senator or a governor,\" he said.",
      "Prakash said that across Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, there has recently been a tendency to settle when a litigant takes a position the administration supports. Administrations also want settlements that will bind the next president to policies their parties support.",

      "A decade after the Supreme Court\u2019s historic Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, some advocates fear the fight for marriage equality is far from over.

      "\u201cFor 49 years, people grew up with that right, and then with the proverbial stroke of a pen on that decision, that right was taken away,\u201d Obergefell said. \u201cWe have to learn from that.\u201d",
      "In his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe, Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly mentioned Obergefell as a decision that the high court should reconsider, raising alarms among same-sex marriage advocates.

      "In Nebraska, the state\u2019s largest worksite immigration raid sent a chilling effect across the city of Omaha this month when federal immigration authorities arrested 76 employees of a meatpacking plant.",
      "About a dozen of them have already been deported or transferred to out-of-state custody. Sixty-three others remain in immigration custody at the Lincoln County Detention Center in Nebraska.",
      "Federal authorities accuse the workers of using stolen identities from U.S. citizens to unlawfully gain employment at Glenn Valley Foods, a meatpacking plant that has been processing boxed beef for more than 15 years.",
      "The Center for Immigrant Refugee and Advancement, an immigrant rights organization in Omaha, provided legal consultations to most of them.",
      "Anne Wurth, the group's associate legal director, told NBC News they are \u201chonest, hardworking individuals in our community\" who have also been victims of an immigration system that \u201cdoes not provide enough pathways\u201d to remain in the country legally.",
      "\"That\u2019s not true,\" said Elhrick Cerdan, the assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Nebraska, who led the enforcement operation at Glenn Valley Foods.",
      "In an interview, Cerdan rejected \u201cthis narrative that these hardworking illegal immigrants were just doing their daily job and trying to earn wages.\"",
      "\"They were stealing the identities of over a hundred U.S. citizens,\" Cerdan said.",
      "Seven people have been charged in connection with the events surrounding the raid at Glenn Valley Foods. Only one of them faces charges of using someone else's Social Security number, court records showed as of Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThat number could change,\u201d Cerdan said, because the investigation continues.",
      "Four protesters, including two U.S. citizens who worked at the plant, face charges accusing them of jumping on law enforcement vehicles as they escorted detainees out of the facility, according to court records.",
      "A Honduran national was charged with resisting arrest and displaying a box cutter when agents tried to apprehend him. A Mexican national is charged with unlawful re-entry into the United States. An employee who was arrested was charged with false representation of a Social Security number.",
      "The rest of the detainees face immigration proceedings, according to Cerdan and Wurth.",

      "\u201cThat day, the biggest concern was officer safety and the safety of the people in that location, whether they were victims, criminals or witnesses,\u201d Cerdan said in a video call Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had an overwhelming number of federal, state and local law enforcement present there.\u201d",
      "Asked how the alleged identity fraud scheme worked, Cerdan declined to provide specific details to protect his investigation. But generally, he said, victims of identity theft lose their information through spam texts, phone calls and emails, as well as illegitimate websites posing as banks or cyberattacks. Often, the information is sold online or on the dark web by a broker or a \u201cdealer of stolen identities,\u201d he said.",
      "Four videos from inside the meat processing facility obtained by NBC News show several agents with their faces covered, wearing tactical gear and asking people for their immigration papers or proof of U.S. citizenship in Spanish. Workers are on edge and scared as some of their colleagues are put in handcuffs and escorted out.",
      "Two other videos from outside Glenn Valley Foods obtained by NBC News show groups of officers, agents and law enforcement vehicles surrounding the plant. The videos also capture family members showing up at the facility to bring documents on behalf of their relatives. Protesters also show up.",
      "It took federal authorities four hours to safely conduct employment authorization audits of every worker at the plant, according to Cerdan and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Nebraska.",
      "Homeland Security agents identified 76 employees at Glenn Valley Foods who lacked valid work authorizations, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThese workers were using Social Security numbers that had not been issued to them,\u201d U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods said.",
      "Based on the findings of the audit, \u201ca large number of suspected fraudulent identification documents\u201d was uncovered, Woods said. \u201cMultiple identities of United States citizens were being fraudulently used by workers at that location.\u201d",
      "Cerdan said workers at Glenn Valley Foods were using the identities of 100 U.S. citizens \u2014 most of them of Latino heritage and from multiple states.",
      "\u201cThese victims have experienced tremendous loss because of reported wages that they did not earn,\u201d he said.",
      "Cerdan said some victims lost federal student aid, as well as disability and health insurance benefits, because \"all of a sudden they\u2019ve made too much income.\" Others had unpaid parking and speeding tickets that didn't belong to them recorded on their driver\u2019s licenses, Cerdan said. Others are being charged taxes \"after their income was falsely increased,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Every employee at Glenn Valley Foods, including those who were detained, was approved through E-Verify, the company's president, Chad Hartmann, told NBC News.",
      "DHS operates the E-Verify system in partnership with the Social Security Administration to let employers know whether prospective employees have legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "\u201cThat system doesn\u2019t capture a solution if somebody\u2019s got a fake ID. That\u2019s what needs to be repaired,\u201d Hartmann said this month.",
      "Cerdan declined to respond to Hartmann's comment, saying E-Verify is run by Immigration and Citizenship Services, another office within DHS.",
      "Wurth said \"it indicates a larger conversation that still needs to be had about reform of the immigration system,\" particularly when it comes to work permits in industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor.",
      "Cerdan said his investigation will continue with a focus on identifying more victims, as well as brokers who may have sold the identities to workers at Glenn Valley Foods."

      "\u201cFirst, I want to say thank you for all the love and support you\u2019ve shown me and my little family, \u201c said Martin, who appeared sitting on a sofa alongside the couple\u2019s newborn daughter, AmyLou.",
      "He then asked followers if they would consider donating to a GoFundMe to help Wright raise their daughter alone.",
      "\u201cThe GoFundMe is to help replace what I would be there for,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt will help replace my income. It will help pay for babysitting. It will help for her school, for her wedding. All of these things that normally Shay and I would do together.\u201d",

      "Since 1989, the matriarch of the Simpson family has entertained viewers as she\u2019s cared for her comedic clan. But many viewers are concerned that they\u2019ve seen the last of her after the Season 36 finale.",

She tells a colleague that she and her brother are \u201creally not that close\u201d and reveals that she previously paid for Bart to go to air conditioning school, but he never followed through with the career.",
      "When Lisa visits her childhood home, she finds her father Homer, who\u2019s supposed to be living in a retirement home that she\u2019s paying for, his friends and her brother Bart. Lisa is annoyed to find out that Bart has been running an unlicensed retirement home out of his house and throwing parties with the money she sent him.",

      "Many fans took to X to share their grief, including one who wrote, \u201cRest in peace Marge Simpson. Lovely caring woman.\u201d",
      "Although many viewers were upset, some noted that Marge\u2019s loss could shake up the show, including one who commented, \u201cMarge Simpson was the glue that hold the family together it shows how for so many years she had to put up with Homer shenanigans. So maybe this makes Simpsons more interesting of a show.\u201d",
      "Still, most fans were in agreement that you shouldn\u2019t mess with a good thing.",
      "\u201cThey f------ killed off Marge Simpson. That\u2019s insanity. Might as well kill off Randy Marsh from South Park and Stewie from Family Guy while you\u2019re at it,\u201d one wrote."

    "story": [
      "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei broke his weeklong silence Thursday, claiming in a televised speech that his country had secured a victory over Israel and delivered a \"slap in the face\" to Washington.",
      "Hours earlier, Iran's government also approved legislation to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a move that will stymie efforts to assess the damage from U.S. airstrikes and monitor uranium enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic emerged victorious and, in return, delivered a harsh slap to America\u2019s face,\u201d Khamenei said after eight days of silence.",
      "The United States had \u201centered a direct war\u201d because it felt like Israel would be \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d if it didn\u2019t, he said, adding that \u201cit gained nothing from this war.\u201d Israel \"had to understand that attacking Iran would come at a heavy cost and thanks to God, that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed a slew of top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. There is still debate, within the U.S. and internationally, about the extent of the damage of American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Khamenei claimed that \"the Americans failed to achieve anything significant in their attack on nuclear facilities.\" On assertions by President Donald Trump that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated,\" the supreme leader added, \"It\u2019s clear that the American president needs to exaggerate, they resort to exaggeration to cover up the truth.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the Iranian Parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation with only one abstention among the 223 lawmakers and none voting against it. Thursday saw the bill's approval by the country's powerful Guardian Council, which includes theologians selected by the supreme leader.",
      "\"Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program will continue with greater speed,\" Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said later. While Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the bill \u201cis a clear response to the illegal attacks against our country.\"",
      "It would mean IAEA inspectors \u201cwill not be allowed entry into the country unless the security of nuclear sites and the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are guaranteed,\u201d he said. And any inspections would also be \u201csubject to approval by the Supreme National Security Council,\u201d he added.",
      "It would thwart efforts by IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, who said at a news conference in Vienna on Wednesday that gaining access to Iran's nuclear facilities was his \"No. 1 priority.\"",
      "He has previously been deeply critical of the Israeli and American strikes, saying \"nuclear facilities should never be attacked due to the very real risk of a serious radiological accident.\"",
      "Sifting through these damaged facilities is potentially very dangerous for his investigators, he said in Vienna.",
      "\"Going back to places that have been shelled is not like going in a normal sort of inspection,\" he said. \"There is rubble. There could be unexploded ordinance.\"",
      "The CIA has cited credible intelligence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d While a Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found it may have only been set back several months, less than claimed by Trump.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will hold a \"major\" news conference at Thursday morning \"in order to fight for the dignity of our great American pilots,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Iran says it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, and it had been complying with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which most experts said was successful in limiting its program, until that was effectively axed by Trump in 2018.",
      "After that, Iran began enriching uranium to much higher grades, more than needed for energy and approaching the potency required for a bomb, the IAEA said.",
      "Grossi also called it \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that Iran is reportedly considering pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",
      "\u201cI hope this is not the case,\" Grossi said of Iran's potential withdrawal. \"I don\u2019t think this would help anybody, starting with Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would lead to isolation, all sorts of problems.\u201d",
      "This 1970 international agreement says that any signatory is barred from developing a nuclear weapon and must be subject to IAEA inspections. Iran, which signed the deal in 1968, says it does not have nuclear weapons; Israel, which is estimated to have around 90 warheads, has never signed the pact.",
      "Iran hard-liners in Washington and elsewhere have been pushing to impose a \u201czero enrichment\u201d ban on Iran \u2014 meaning it would be prevented even from using enriched uranium for nuclear power. Iranian officials point to these arguments as reasons why the country should renege.",
      "\u201cIf we are to remain a member of this treaty, we cannot accept only its obligations while being deprived of the rights it guarantees,\u201d Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Baghaei said Wednesday. \u201cThese rights are clearly defined: the right to peaceful nuclear energy for non-military purposes.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \u201cIran is ready to cooperate in enhancing regional security and strengthening peace and stability,\u201d Pezeshkia said, according to state media. \u201cWe support the establishment of a region free of nuclear weapons and even weapons of mass destruction.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu\u2019s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero,\u201d Trump added.",

      "Netanyahu's supporters, meanwhile, welcomed Trump\u2019s comments. In a post on X, he said it was \u201ctime to put an end to this outrageous injustice and personal persecution \u2014 and cancel this absurd trial once and for all.\u201d",
      "Trump's supportive comments struck a different tone from just a day before when he admonished both Israel and Iran. He accused them of violating a ceasefire shortly after it was agreed to bring an end to 12 days of fighting between the Middle East rivals which began when Israeli forces first launched strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program June 13.",
      "After getting off to a rocky start, the ceasefire was swiftly re-established after both nations launched strikes on each other early Tuesday, drawing rebuke from Trump. It remained in affect early Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu has faced repeated allegations throughout Israel's war in the Gaza Strip that he is delaying an end to the conflict to stall the corruption trial. He has cited the war and security concerns as his reasons for asking for the proceedings to be postponed.",
      "Hundreds of people have been killed in the enclave since mid-March when a brief two-month ceasefire came to an end.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 56,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Israel's military assault, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nba/nba-draft-cooper-flagg-mavericks-takeaways-rcna215122",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:02:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Which teams got better and which teams made questionable picks in Wednesday's NBA Draft? Let's break it all down.",
    "story": [
      "Around the NBA, it's often said that a draft class can't be evaluated for at least two years to see who the true winners, losers, breakout stars and disappointments were.",
      "But what would be the fun in that?",
      "As soon as the 2025 draft's first round wrapped Wednesday night in Brooklyn, New York, NBC News analyzed some of the major storylines to emerge from the first 30 picks.",
      "How will No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg fit in Dallas?",
      "Greif: A player of Flagg's versatility would fit in anywhere in the NBA, but I\u2019m most interested in how much Dallas coach Jason Kidd allows Flagg to handle the ball and initiate the Mavericks\u2019 offense given Kyrie Irving is expected to miss all of next season after injuring a knee ligament.",
      "The Mavericks should have enough salary flexibility this offseason to bring in a point guard (Chris Paul, anyone?) but with Dallas in win-now mode, it would seem to benefit their future to get Flagg a lot of reps as early as possible as a playmaker, just as they did with Luka Doncic in 2018. As someone who watched Flagg play comfortably against established NBA stars when he was only 17 years old, during a scrimmage against the U.S. national team in 2024, I don't have many doubts he will enter the league with a feel for how to handle NBA defenses.",
      "Nadkarni: Flagg should be a great fit with the Mavericks, especially because he will be entering a lower pressure situation than most top draft picks. I\u2019m especially curious to see how he fits in on the defensive side of the ball.",
      "Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, who coached Flagg on the USA Select Team ahead of the Olympics last year, praised Flagg for his attention to detail on that end of the floor after their time together. Flagg could end up being a nice defensive piece on the wing for a roster that already includes Anthony Davis and an emerging rim protector in Dereck Lively III.",
      "Favorite pick",
      "Nadkarni: Ace Bailey was something of a lightning rod entering Wednesday, but he seems like a smart gamble for the Jazz. Utah is in the unenviable position of not being a top target for free agents. The Jazz don\u2019t get many opportunities to acquire a player of Bailey\u2019s talent. And after Utah\u2019s pick fell out of the top four, grabbing a player who many expected to be in the top three feels like a home run.",
      "Could Bailey grumble at first? Sure. Still, he\u2019ll be cost-controlled for four years, and the Jazz will have an opportunity to put a competitive roster around him in the meantime. Though they aren\u2019t quite the same player, remember that this is the same franchise that was once lifted by a young Donovan Mitchell. Bailey should receive a similar opportunity to make his own mark in the backcourt.",
      "Greif: VJ Edgecombe to Philadelphia at No. 3. There was more speculation about whether the Sixers would use or trade their pick, given they are coming off a nightmare season that saw a preseason title contender stumble to 24 wins after an injury to former MVP Joel Embiid and a disappointing first season for splashy free-agent signing Paul George. Holding onto it to select Edgecombe feels like the right move to fit both timelines the team is considering.",
      "He's a player who makes the team better right now, if Philadelphia is still pursuing a championship \u2014 on a team of older, injury-prone stars, his athleticism is badly needed \u2014 and he certainly is a building block for the future, in case the franchise is considering a pivot toward the future. Edgecombe playing with electric young guard Tyrese Maxey is something I'll be watching on League Pass often.",
      "Most surprising pick",
      "Greif: There were a couple of strong passers who made surprising leaps up the draft board. The first was BYU\u2019s Egor Demin, who went eighth overall to Brooklyn, around 20 picks higher than many mock drafts expected. But the biggest jump was Yang Hansen of China, who went from being projected to be taken in the middle of Thursday\u2019s second round to 16th overall, in a trade that lands him in Portland.",
      "No one seemed to have seen that rise coming, but the 7-foot-1 big man\u2019s touch and creative flair as a passer has earned him comparisons to Nikola Jokic. (I\u2019ll admit, the footage of his passes immediately brought to mind visions of Arvydas Sabonis deftly finding open Trail Blazers teammates in the 1990s.)",
      "Let\u2019s pump the brakes a tad; Jokic is the best-passing big man of all-time, and among the best passers ever regardless of position. Yet considering Hansen averaged 15 points, 11 rebounds and four assists playing in China\u2019s top professional division two years ago while still a teenager, I\u2019m intrigued by whether he can hang in the NBA.",
      "Nadkarni: Khaman Maluach was a no-brainer pick for the Suns at No. 10. (The Rockets technically made the selection but it will go to Phoenix as part of the Kevin Durant trade.) Except, within minutes of selecting Maluach, the Suns traded two first-round picks for Hornets center Mark Williams. Huh?",
      "Williams and Maluach are not the kind of big men who can play alongside one another. I understand Phoenix was desperate in the frontcourt. But a pick-strapped team using three first-round picks on two centers is baffling. Maluach would have been a home run had the Suns simply not also traded for Williams. Maybe things will all shake out in the future (Williams could be a trade chip again.) For now, though, drafting Maluach and trading multiple picks for another center doesn\u2019t seem like the most efficient use of resources.",
      "More NBA Draft",
      "The U.S. revoked visas from a top basketball player\u2019s country. How the NBA kept his dream alive.He\u2019s either an NBA star or the draft\u2019s biggest bust. Teams are trying to decide which it is.Why Cooper Flagg is one of the NBA\u2019s most intriguing prospects of the last 15 years",

      "Why Cooper Flagg is one of the NBA\u2019s most intriguing prospects of the last 15 years",
      "Team that won (or lost) the night",
      "Nadkarni: It may be time to nationalize the New Orleans Pelicans. Seriously, what are they doing?",
      "New Orleans already made somewhat of a strange move this summer, trading C.J. McCollum\u2019s expiring contract for two years of Jordan Poole. Sure, whatever.",
      "The real head-scratcher came Wednesday night when New Orleans traded up from No. 23 to No. 13 with the Atlanta Hawks to take Maryland big man Derik Queen \u2014 and gave up a 2026 unprotected first-round pick in the process. Unprotected! A pick that\u2019s going to be the worst between the Pelicans and the Milwaukee Bucks, both teams that are expected to be very bad next year.",
      "There is actually a decent chance New Orleans just traded a potential top-five pick for a late lottery selection. For a team that\u2019s rebuilding, I\u2019m struggling to figure out how this makes sense.",
      "Greif: Rohan, I second your confusion over what is happening in New Orleans. You covered that ground so thoroughly, I'll focus on the positive. I'm cheating a bit but I have two teams that won the night, and both because of the guards they selected.",
      "Let's start with Washington's selection of Tre Johnson at No. 6. In the past week the Wizards have shipped out Jordan Poole, a guard who seemed too untrustworthy to be part of any long-term rebuild, and brought back consummate veteran scorer CJ McCollum from New Orleans in exchange. The Wizards need grown-ups in the room and McCollum, a former union president, gives them that. He'll be there to help mentor Johnson, who came out of Texas as one of the best pure scorers available.",
      "By selecting Ace Bailey and Walter Clayton Jr., Utah has also seemingly chosen a clear direction after spending the past several years wandering through the NBA wilderness in order to earn high draft picks. Bailey has enormous potential, if he can learn to accept playing in Utah, which reportedly was not among his preferred destinations. Clayton Jr. is a winner and watching him guide Florida to multiple comebacks en route to winning the NCAA championship makes me think he'll bring a level of instant competence to the point guard position."

      "On June 4, the Justice Department sued Texas over the Texas Dream Act, then quickly filed a joint motion with Texas asking a judge to declare the law unconstitutional and permanently enjoin Texas from enforcing the law. The same day, the judge did.",
      "Outside organizations sought to invalidate the ruling Tuesday, arguing that the Justice Department and Paxton\u2019s office \u201ccolluded to secure an agreed injunction\u201d and engaged in improper \u201clegal choreography\u201d to obtain their desired outcome.",
      "Speaking at the Republican Attorneys General Association a day after the quick court victory, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli seemed to confirm that.",
      "\u201cSo just yesterday, we had filed a lawsuit against Texas, had a consent decree the same day, or consent judgment, and it got granted hours later,\u201d Kambli told participants, according to audio obtained by NBC News. \u201cAnd what it did was, because we were able to have that line of communication and talk in advance, a statute that\u2019s been a problem for the state for 24 years, we got rid of it in six hours.\u201d",
      "Kambli, who previously worked for Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, added that the Justice Department has \u201cgood relationships\u201d with state attorneys general, which allows it to \u201cget things done.\u201d",
      "Kambli also said the second Trump administration \u201cis learning how to be offensive-minded,\" according to the audio.",
      "\u201cI think that was the biggest critique the first time around in the first Trump administration \u2014 there were a lot of missed opportunities to wield federal government power for the things that we value that just never happened,\u201d Kambli said. \u201cBut this time we\u2019ve brought in a lot of people from state AG world that have done that kind of litigation, know how to do it and have been doing it.\u201d",
      "Paxton's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not dispute that Kambli made the statements and said it was \u201cpretty standard\u201d for Justice Department lawyers to notify state attorneys general of federal lawsuits ahead of time. He cited a Justice Department policy that providing fair warning to state attorneys general before filing lawsuits could \u201cresolve matters prior to litigation.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department filed the lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor, a George W. Bush nominee in the Wichita Falls Division in the Northern District of Texas whose court has become a destination for conservative litigants seeking favorable outcomes.",
      "The groups Democracy Forward, the ACLU Foundation of Texas and the National Immigration Law Center filed a motion Tuesday on behalf of La Uni\u00f3n del Pueblo Entero, a union founded by C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. They argued that the sequence of events \u201ccompels one conclusion: the United States and the Texas Attorney General colluded to predetermine the outcome of the case.\u201d",
      "The motion added: \u201cThe founders did not design our adversarial system for shadowboxing between co-parties. The system demands opposition, argument, and deliberation \u2014 not consent decrees masquerading as litigation.\"",
      "Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, criticized Paxton for not defending the bipartisan Texas Dream Act, which the Legislature passed and Gov. Rick Perry signed more than two decades ago. She noted that the Legislature had declined to repeal the law.",
      "Paxton recently announced that he is going to challenge U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the Republican primary next year \u2014 a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cInstead of defending the law of Texas ... Attorney General Paxton colluded with the Trump-Vance administration to try to eliminate the law through the courts,\u201d Perryman said in a statement. \u201cThis maneuver is a misuse of the courts. If Attorney General Paxton will not defend Texans, we will. We are committed to ensuring that this cynical move is opposed, to defending the Texas Dream Act, and to supporting the courage of our clients.\u201d",
      "Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said the heads of the Texas House and Senate should be concerned that Paxton\u2019s office declined to defend a state law.",
      "\"The whole American premise of settling a case is that you have people who have conflicting interests and that's why they're in court to begin with,\" Tobias said. \"But of course, we know for political reasons, they're probably not.\"",
      "Saikrishna Prakash of the University of Virginia School of Law, who has researched the duty of state attorneys general to defend laws in all 50 states, said more attorneys general are willing to say laws are unconstitutional.",
      "\"Part of the reason why they're more willing to do that is a political reason, that they want to be senator or a governor,\" he said.",
      "Prakash said that across Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, there has recently been a tendency to settle when a litigant takes a position the administration supports. Administrations also want settlements that will bind the next president to policies their parties support.",
      "\"In my mind, it's not a good way to run a railroad, whether done by Biden or by Trump,\" Prakash said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration is suing more states over in-state tuition policies for undocumented students. The Justice Department sued Kentucky last week over its policy of giving in-state tuition to undocumented migrants. On Wednesday, the Justice Department sued the state of Minnesota over its law doing the same.",
      "In both instances, the Justice Department pointed to the outcome in the Texas case as justification."

Temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit were widespread across the Ohio Valley and through the East Coast. \u201cExtremely dangerous heat\u201d is expected to persist through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "But what is a heat dome, and why does the phenomenon bring oppressive heat with it?",
      "A heat dome occurs when a strong and persistent region of high pressure sits over land and traps hot air, like a lid on a pot.",
      "Heat domes are usually affected by the behavior of the jet stream, a ribbon of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere that flows from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere and affects weather systems.",
      "The jet stream is fueled by temperature differences between the colder polar region to the north and warmer air masses to the south. As the jet stream flows around the planet, it can ripple in places, creating troughs and ridges that often result in unusual weather patterns.",
      "Certain ripples can, for instance, amplify cold snaps. Others can move hot air over land, blasting heat and intensifying humidity.",
      "Heat domes can linger for days or weeks, fueling prolonged heat waves that can turn deadly. Heat-related illness and death can affect any person of any age, but children, people with pre-existing health conditions and the elderly are particularly susceptible when temperatures spike.",
      "Climate change is also increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves around the world, studies have shown. The planet's 10 hottest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes Saturday on several nuclear facilities in Iran has divided Americans and exposed fault lines within the coalitions of both the parties, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.",
      "Among U.S. adults, 45% oppose the airstrikes, versus 38% who support them. An additional 18% of Americans said they neither support nor oppose the strikes, illustrating how fluid the situation is.",
      "While this survey was in the field from Monday through Wednesday, Iran launched a retaliatory missile barrage at a U.S. military site in Qatar. Trump then announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, chastised both countries for appearing to break the terms and then congratulated them for stopping attacks. Meanwhile, questions still remain about the ultimate consequences of the U.S. strikes, including exactly what damage they did to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Support for the airstrikes divided predictably along partisan lines. Among Democrats, 77% oppose the airstrikes, with 61% strongly opposed. In a near-mirror image, 78% of Republicans support the airstrikes, with 60% strongly supporting them.",
      "Independents are much more divided, with 45% opposing the airstrikes, 21% supporting and 34% who neither support nor oppose the move \u2014 almost twice the share of the overall population who took the neutral position.",
      "The lead-up to the strikes last week exposed a split in the Republican Party between those with isolationist tendencies in the MAGA wing of the GOP and those with more hawkish, traditionalist Republican Party foreign policy positions. A testy exchange between right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz illustrated the divide, with Carlson forcefully arguing that attacking Iran would betray the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d promises.",
      "But while there is a split among Republicans in the poll, it is an exact inversion of the public debate between prominent pro-Trump figures.",
      "While all Republican factions support the airstrikes, respondents who identify with the MAGA movement are significantly more supportive of the strikes than those who identify as traditional Republicans. Though there are some high-profile dissenters on Iran within the MAGA movement, the rank and file of the movement is firmly in favor of the strikes.",
      "Fully 84% of Republicans who identify with the MAGA movement support the strikes, including 70% who strongly support them. In contrast, 72% of Republicans who identify themselves more as supporters of the party support the strikes, with 49% strongly supporting them.",
      "What happens next",
      "While more Americans oppose the airstrikes than support them, a majority (60%) also support a continuation in military action if Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains intact. Initial intelligence assessments indicate that the strikes only set Iran\u2019s nuclear program back three to six months, though it will take more time to make a final assessment. Trump and his administration have pushed back against those conclusions.",
      "Overall, 26% of Americans say that the U.S. should consider all options for future military action, including the use of ground troops. A slightly higher 34% say they support continued military operations, but only through airstrikes. The remainder of Americans (41%) believe the U.S. should not take further military action in Iran.",
      "The question of how to proceed with military action in Iran also splits the Democratic coalition, with a large divide between those who identify themselves more as supporters of the party versus those who identify themselves more as supporters of the progressive movement.",
      "Among progressives, 75% say the U.S. should not take any further military action in Iran. Meanwhile, supporters of the traditional wing of the Democratic Party are nearly evenly split, with 54% saying that no further action should be taken, and 45% supporting some degree of further action if Iran maintains its nuclear program. Nearly one-fifth \u2014 19% \u2014 of  traditional Democrats believe that the U.S. should consider all options, including the use of ground forces.",
      "Tempering this support for continued military action in Iran is a deep concern about the conflict escalating into a broader regional conflict in the Middle East. A full 78% of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about the conflict escalating. This includes 55% of Republicans, 83% of independents and 95% of Democrats.",
      "The role of Congress",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have questioned the legality of Trump\u2019s decision to launch the military strikes on Iran. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., called the strikes unconstitutional, and he had joined with Democrats to introduce a bipartisan resolution before the attacks to block such action without congressional authorization. (He later said that the cessation of hostilities after the strikes would remove the need for a vote on the resolution.)",
      "A majority (60%) of Americans say that Trump should have received congressional authorization before launching the strikes.",
      "While responses to this question were deeply divided along partisan lines, 19% of Republicans agreed that Trump should have received congressional approval first. And 92% of Democrats agreed with the need for authorization, as did 71% of independents.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey was conducted online June 23-25 among a national sample of 5,448 adults ages 18 and over. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "\u201cThat day, the biggest concern was officer safety and the safety of the people in that location, whether they were victims, criminals or witnesses,\u201d Cerdan said in a video call Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had an overwhelming number of federal, state and local law enforcement present there.\u201d",
      "Asked how the alleged identity fraud scheme worked, Cerdan declined to provide specific details to protect his investigation. But generally, he said, victims of identity theft lose their information through spam texts, phone calls and emails, as well as illegitimate websites posing as banks or cyberattacks. Often, the information is sold online or on the dark web by a broker or a \u201cdealer of stolen identities,\u201d he said.",
      "Four videos from inside the meat processing facility obtained by NBC News show several agents with their faces covered, wearing tactical gear and asking people for their immigration papers or proof of U.S. citizenship in Spanish.

    "story": [
      "A decade after the Supreme Court\u2019s historic Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, some advocates fear the fight for marriage equality is far from over. Among them is Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the case, who became the face of the 2015 decision and has continued to advocate for LGBTQ rights.",
      "\u201cTen years later, I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to be talking about the threats to marriage equality, the potential for Obergefell to be overturned,\u201d Obergefell told NBC News in an interview.",
      "The 2015 ruling was a turning point for LGBTQ rights. But Obergefell said he fears recent comments from conservative Supreme Court justices may signal a willingness to overturn it, particularly after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "\u201cFor 49 years, people grew up with that right, and then with the proverbial stroke of a pen on that decision, that right was taken away,\u201d Obergefell said. \u201cWe have to learn from that.\u201d",
      "In his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe, Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly mentioned Obergefell as a decision that the high court should reconsider, raising alarms among same-sex marriage advocates. Justice Samuel Alito, in a separate 2024 opinion, also expressed concerns about the Obergefell decision, warning that Americans who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds could be labeled as bigots."

      "Teaming up with internet personality Blakely Thornton, the TODAY with Jenna & Friends contributor leans into nostalgia while exploring viral moments in celebrity history between 2000 and 2015, such as the infamous \"Lady Marmalade\" feud or the legacy of the reality show \"Jon & Kate Plus 8.\"",
      "\"Those moments in pop culture \u2014 those Britney (Spears), those Lindsay (Lohan), those Paris (Hilton) moments \u2014 shaped who I was as a gay man,\" Sylvester, 38, tells TODAY.com. \"When I found Blakely Thornton, we decided to do this podcast so we can give those pop culture moments some love.\"",

      "\"For myself, Lance Bass coming out was such a pivotal moment in 2006,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"It was kind of, sort of, when coming out started becoming something that you could emotionally survive.",
      "\"Before Lance Bass came out, people were outed, and Lance Bass kind of ushered in not only being yourself, but being able to survive it and reinvent and keep going and keep it moving,\" he adds. \"Now being friends with Lance Bass, I can say it wasn't easy for him, but it made it easier for all of us.\"",

      "In the full interview, he shared that he decided to come out because rumors about his sexuality \"were starting to affect my daily life.\" (Bass later told Attitude magazine that he chose to come out after celebrity gossip bloggers like Perez Hilton \"bullied\" him with intense coverage at the time. Hilton apologized for some of his content in a 2010 video and said while he didn't see himself as a bully, he would be doing things differently.)",
      "\"Now it feels like it\u2019s on my terms. I\u2019m at peace with my family, my friends, myself and God so there\u2019s really nothing else that I worry about,\" Bass told People at the time.",
      "Sylvester says he remembers feeling \"taken aback\" reading about Bass coming forward with his sexuality.",
      "\"It was somebody that we grew up with, someone that we idolize and someone that in my mind, I thought could make a big difference, and it scared the hell out of me as well at the same time, because I had a secret that I was hiding,\" he says.",

      "\"I think deep down inside, he did it for all of us,\" Sylvester says. \"He didn't even know it at the time. He had no idea what the impact it was going to have, but I do remind him.\"",
      "Other moments that live \"rent-free\" in Sylvester's mind include Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the rise of RuPaul.",
      "\"As a little boy in 1996, watching VH1 during the summer and seeing 'The RuPaul Show' with an out, gay man at the helm \u2014\u00a0pivotal in my life. It gave me something to look forward to,\" he says.",
      "It's part of why he knew he wanted to be an entertainment journalist. Calling fame and celebrity \"scary,\" he says he recognized that he wanted to \"be close enough to the fire without getting burned.\"",
      "\"I think every model wanted to be Cindy (Crawford), they wanted to be Naomi (Campbell). ... That's what models wanted to do. If you're an actor, you wanted to be Tom Cruise, you wanted to be Brad Pitt,\" he says. \"For people like me who are TV hosts, I used to watch Ryan Seacrest, Catt Sadler and Giuliana DePandi, and that's all I ever wanted to do.\""

      "Hargitay had journeyed to the home of Sabin Gray, a diehard fan of her late mother, actor and 1950s sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, to see his collection of Mansfield memorabilia. Hargitay, whose  HBO documentary, \"My Mom Jayne,\" comes out on June 27, ended the visit with a shocking realization.",
      "\"It was a little overwhelming for me because there were life-size cutouts, and it was truly like a museum or a shrine to her,\" Hargitay said. \"That was hard for me at that age to sort of understand. ... I\u2019m seeing all this stuff that I had never seen and kind of grew up away from all of that.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s showing me all these photos. He\u2019s showing me whatever it is, dresses that she had that he\u2019d collected, earrings that she wore, things from movies from the movie set, props or whatever, and then he says to me, 'Do you want to see a picture of Nelson?'\" she recalled.",
      "The question immediately unnerved Hargitay, who was 3 years old when her mother died in a car accident in 1967.",
      "\"I just looked at him, and this jolt went through my body, and I said, 'Who's Nelson?'\" she said. \"And then I knew in one second.\"",

      "\"He sort of panicked and turned white, and he said, 'Oh, it\u2019s probably not true, it\u2019s probably not true,' and that\u2019s when I knew,\" Hargitay said. \"And I think that (Gray) couldn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t know. I was 25, how could I not know?\"",
      "Hargitay was then shown a picture of Sardelli.",
      "\"On a cellular level, it was just like DNA talking to DNA,\" she said. \"I knew it was true, and I just really thought my life was over.\"",

      "\"I remember leaving and driving to my brother\u2019s house, and I thought I was going to crash my car because I was so not present,\" she said. \"I was totally dissociated and out of my body, and I got to my brother\u2019s house. I didn\u2019t even know how I got there, but I knew that I shouldn\u2019t be driving. It was crazy.\"",
      "Hargitay's world was upended. She was very close with Mickey Hargitay, who had raised her after Mansfield was killed in an accident in which Mariska and her two brothers, Zoltan and Mickey Jr., were also in the car.",
      "\"The one thing I did have, the one thing that I was rooted in, the one thing that was my constant, was no longer mine,\" she said about realizing Mickey Hargitay was not her biological father. \"And my identity was just smashed. It was like it broke in two.\"",

      "It started to make sense to her why during her childhood \"everyone asked me if I was Italian.\"",
      "Once she drove to the home of one of her brothers, she asked him if he knew about Sardelli being her biological father.",
      "\"I\u2019m very, very, very, very close with my brother, and he didn\u2019t (know), so then that was also confusing,\" she said. \"And then I went up to my dad\u2019s house, and I was hysterically crying and in a state.\"",
      "She said Mickey Hargitay was in the process of physically building her a home when she asked him about Sardelli.",
      "\"So I drive up to the house that he is building me and confront him, and he was like, 'What? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? That\u2019s so not true,'\" she said.",
      "\"He kept saying, 'You look like my father, you look exactly like my father, you're a Hargitay to the end,'\" she continued. \"The irony is that I'm more like my dad than anyone in our whole family. Like, I am mini-Mickey, right? And so it was just a very extraordinarily painful moment. I say that this is the moment that I became an adult, and it's so visceral for me because I was in so much pain, I was so overwhelmed.\"",
      "Despite finding out the stunning truth about her bloodline, she did not press Mickey Hargitay on the issue.",

I love him. We're done here.'",

      "While she was managing her emotions with Mickey, Hargitay also was reeling at the thought that Sardelli had not acknowledged her as his daughter.",
      "\"That was where the injury was,\" she said, \"is, why wasn\u2019t I claimed? He must have known. He didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t love me, I wasn\u2019t worth it, I was nothing to him. He knew, he had to know that I was his daughter, and I wasn\u2019t worth it. I wasn\u2019t valuable enough, and that\u2019s what I lived with, is that I wasn\u2019t enough.\"",
      "\"So having that feeling of, my mother left me and then again my father abandoned me was so hard to integrate or make sense out of,\" she added.",
      "At 61 years old, Hargitay said she now has the benefit of being able to view the situation with more wisdom.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this life to grow into the miracle of my story, and having this comprehensive understanding and getting the full perspective and now seeing that I had such a limited, teeny, teeny, teeny sliver of the truth (at the time),\" she said."

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "A life-changing Hollywood party",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "From music to medicine",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "The teen idols grow up",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\"Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\" Poublon wrote."

      "Episode 20 picks up where all that left off. Everyone at the villa and everyone at Casa are coupled up with bombshells and seeing what comes of those connections. Meanwhile, Amaya and TJ currently don\u2019t have couples \u2014 and if they don\u2019t find one within the next day, they\u2019re dumped from the island.",
      "Over at Casa, Cierra, who has a strong connection with Nic back at the villa, is vibing with bombshell Elan. \u201cWithin five minutes of conversing, I was like, \u2018Oh, s\u2014, this is going really well,\u201d she says in a confessional. Later, she gets emotional about leaning into a new connection after developing such strong feelings for Nic.",
      "Things seem to be going well for the other girl islanders: Chelley vibes with bombshell Chris. Iris likes bombshell Zac. And Huda is seeking out bombshell J.D. Huda reflects in a confessional how much she\u2019s enjoying herself after dedicating so much of her time prior to Jeremiah, who was dumped before Casa.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to finally be in the zone,\u201d she says in a confessional. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been so closed off, and I haven\u2019t gotten a chance to form connections. I\u2019m having so much fun.\u201d",
      "At the villa, bombshells Coco and Clarke are both connecting with Taylor and Ace, and bombshell Jaden is liking both Austin and Nic.",
      "The stakes remain high for Amaya and TJ, who have to find a connection by nighttime. Amaya has an emotional talk with J.D., then has another chat with Zak, who kisses her for a second time. TJ is continuing to chat with most of the girl bombshells in the villa and seems to connect most with Vanna.",
      "Just as Olandria, Cierra and Huda wonder what happens to the singled-out islander if Amaya finds a connection, both groups at Casa and the villa receive a text: A re-coupling is taking place that night, and those without a pair will be single and vulnerable.",
      "Who Goes Home on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019 Tonight?",
      "When the groups at both Casa and the villa are invited to gather around the fire pits for the re-couplings, the two singles \u2014 Amaya and TJ \u2014 are told to stand.",
      "Viewers see what happens at Casa first. If a bombshell wishes to couple with Amaya, they\u2019re asked to stand. Zak gets to his feet. He coupled with Olandria when they first got to Casa \u2014 so this now leaves Olandria vulnerable.",
      "The rest of the bombshells are asked if any of them wish to couple with Olandria. When nobody stands, the group gets a text that Olandria is dumped from the island. The girls are understandably emotional, as Olandria is an original cast member and had a strong connection with Taylor, who\u2019s back at the villa.",
      "\u201cI did not want to say goodbye here, and I feel like this time I was actually getting it right,\u201d Olandria says in her confessional as she leaves Casa.",

      "It starts with TJ. If any of the girls wish to couple with TJ, they\u2019re asked to stand \u2014 so Vanna does. Vanna had been coupled with Ace since the girl bombshells arrived at the villa, so the process begins again: If anyone wants to couple with Ace, they\u2019re asked to stand. Coco then gets up, leaving her current match, Taylor, vulnerable. Then Clarke stands for Taylor, leaving Nic single.",
      "When nobody stands to couple with Nic, the villa\u2019s re-coupling ends there: Nic is asked to pack his bags.",
      "Nic and Olandria Are Dumped ... or Are They?!",

    "story": [
      "Disney+'s ill-fated \"Lizzie McGuire\" reboot remains a sore spot for many who rooted for the continuation of the early aughts series.",
      "When Jake Thomas, the actor who played the mischievous younger brother to the show\u2019s titular character, found out that the revival officially got canceled in 2020, he took it as a sign.",
      "\"I have a theory: to a certain degree, the show is cursed,\" the 35-year-old actor said during a June 14 interview on \"Zach Sang Show Clips.\" During the episode, Thomas reflected on the series and its several brushes with revitalization.",
      "For two seasons, Thomas appeared as Matt McGuire and appeared alongside Hilary Duff in the Disney Channel original series that aired from 2001 to 2004. The show inspired the 2003 film \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie,\u201d which had a theatrical release.",
      "\u201cBecause this is not the first time we\u2019ve tried to do a continuation of the show,\u201d he explained. \"Originally, we were going to do, after the original run on Disney Channel, they were going to put us on prime time ABC.\"",
      "Thomas reflected on how Disney had once considered a spinoff series, which was going to follow Lizzie McGuire into high school.",
      "\"(It would have been) Lizzie McGuire: now she's in high school!\" he explained. \"But it was going to be a prime time, like a dramatic series ... it just never came together.\u201d",
      "Over a decade later, in 2019, Disney sought to revive its focus on Lizzie \u2014 this time, with the Disney+ reboot series that was meant to follow Lizzie as an adult. At the time, the studio announced the series on social media and later completed production on two episodes before its ultimate cancelation in 2020.",
      "As the story goes, the reboot never saw the light of day. However, Thomas explained that he didn't hear about the series' cancelation from the studio or production, but through a friend.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like, 'Hey, man, I\u2019m so sorry.' I was like, 'What? He was like, 'Hilary posted on Instagram,'\" Thomas explained before detailing his experience of reading the post by Duff, in which she announced the reboot's cancelation and expressed her disappointment.",
      "\"I found out I wasn't going to have a job, which kind of sucked, and then later, I got a call,\" he recalled. \"I mean, it sucked to find out I didn't have a job from Instagram.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely disheartened, just because, you know, I never thought they would really do a reboot,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen it did start to happen, it just it felt very unreal.\"",
      "Thomas details the process being such a surreal experience, especially as the McGuire house had been brought back to life.",
      "\"I still to this day, it's kind of like, 'Did that really happen?'\" he explained. \"Because they recreated down to every detail they could find the McGuire house interior on the sound stage, and walking into that felt like that was a space that was so impactful within my life and my childhood, of growing up on that set and seeing it again, it was crazy.\u201d",
      "Thomas said the experience put him through \"all the different stages of grief,\" but that he is now able to look back with perspective.",
      "\"It is what it is,\" he concluded. \"My response nowadays is just like, 'That's Hollywood.'\""

      "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei broke his weeklong silence Thursday, claiming in a televised speech that his country had secured a victory over Israel and delivered a \"slap in the face\" to Washington.",
      "Hours earlier, Iran's government also approved legislation to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a move that will stymie efforts to assess the damage from U.S. airstrikes and monitor uranium enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic emerged victorious and, in return, delivered a harsh slap to America\u2019s face,\u201d Khamenei said after eight days of silence.",
      "The United States had \u201centered a direct war\u201d because it felt like Israel would be \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d if it didn\u2019t, he said, adding that \u201cit gained nothing from this war.\u201d Israel \"had to understand that attacking Iran would come at a heavy cost and thanks to God, that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed a slew of top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. There is still debate, within the U.S. and internationally, about the extent of the damage of American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Khamenei claimed that \"the Americans failed to achieve anything significant in their attack on nuclear facilities.\" On assertions by President Donald Trump that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated,\" the supreme leader added, \"It\u2019s clear that the American president needs to exaggerate, they resort to exaggeration to cover up the truth.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the Iranian Parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation with only one abstention among the 223 lawmakers and none voting against it. Thursday saw the bill's approval by the country's powerful Guardian Council, which includes theologians selected by the supreme leader.",
      "\"Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program will continue with greater speed,\" Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said later. While Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the bill \u201cis a clear response to the illegal attacks against our country.\"",
      "It would mean IAEA inspectors \u201cwill not be allowed entry into the country unless the security of nuclear sites and the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are guaranteed,\u201d he said. And any inspections would also be \u201csubject to approval by the Supreme National Security Council,\u201d he added.",
      "It would thwart efforts by IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, who said at a news conference in Vienna on Wednesday that gaining access to Iran's nuclear facilities was his \"No. 1 priority.\"",
      "He has previously been deeply critical of the Israeli and American strikes, saying \"nuclear facilities should never be attacked due to the very real risk of a serious radiological accident.\"",
      "Sifting through these damaged facilities is potentially very dangerous for his investigators, he said in Vienna.",
      "\"Going back to places that have been shelled is not like going in a normal sort of inspection,\" he said. \"There is rubble. There could be unexploded ordinance.\"",
      "The CIA has cited credible intelligence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d While a Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found it may have only been set back several months, less than claimed by Trump.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will hold a \"major\" news conference at Thursday morning \"in order to fight for the dignity of our great American pilots,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Iran says it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, and it had been complying with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which most experts said was successful in limiting its program, until that was effectively axed by Trump in 2018.",
      "After that, Iran began enriching uranium to much higher grades, more than needed for energy and approaching the potency required for a bomb, the IAEA said.",
      "Grossi also called it \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that Iran is reportedly considering pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",
      "\u201cI hope this is not the case,\" Grossi said of Iran's potential withdrawal. \"I don\u2019t think this would help anybody, starting with Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would lead to isolation, all sorts of problems.\u201d",
      "This 1970 international agreement says that any signatory is barred from developing a nuclear weapon and must be subject to IAEA inspections. Iran, which signed the deal in 1968, says it does not have nuclear weapons; Israel, which is estimated to have around 90 warheads, has never signed the pact.",
      "Iran hard-liners in Washington and elsewhere have been pushing to impose a \u201czero enrichment\u201d ban on Iran \u2014 meaning it would be prevented even from using enriched uranium for nuclear power. Iranian officials point to these arguments as reasons why the country should renege.",
      "\u201cIf we are to remain a member of this treaty, we cannot accept only its obligations while being deprived of the rights it guarantees,\u201d Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Baghaei said Wednesday. \u201cThese rights are clearly defined: the right to peaceful nuclear energy for non-military purposes.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \u201cIran is ready to cooperate in enhancing regional security and strengthening peace and stability,\u201d Pezeshkia said, according to state media. \u201cWe support the establishment of a region free of nuclear weapons and even weapons of mass destruction.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu\u2019s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero,\u201d Trump added.",

      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Prosecutors say these were worth hundreds of thousands of shekels.",

      "A verdict isn\u2019t expected until 2026 at the earliest, while Netanyahu will also have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "One of Netanyahu's main rivals, opposition leader Yair Lapid, criticized Trump's decision to weigh in on the proceedings. \u201cWith all due respect and gratitude to the president of the United States, he\u2019s not supposed to intervene in a legal process of an independent state,\" he told the Israeli news website Ynet on Wednesday.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters, meanwhile, welcomed Trump\u2019s comments. In a post on X, he said it was \u201ctime to put an end to this outrageous injustice and personal persecution \u2014 and cancel this absurd trial once and for all.\u201d",
      "Trump's supportive comments struck a different tone from just a day before when he admonished both Israel and Iran. He accused them of violating a ceasefire shortly after it was agreed to bring an end to 12 days of fighting between the Middle East rivals which began when Israeli forces first launched strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program June 13.",
      "After getting off to a rocky start, the ceasefire was swiftly re-established after both nations launched strikes on each other early Tuesday, drawing rebuke from Trump. It remained in affect early Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu has faced repeated allegations throughout Israel's war in the Gaza Strip that he is delaying an end to the conflict to stall the corruption trial. He has cited the war and security concerns as his reasons for asking for the proceedings to be postponed.",
      "Hundreds of people have been killed in the enclave since mid-March when a brief two-month ceasefire came to an end.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 56,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Israel's military assault, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave."

Democratic lawmakers have accused the White House of possibly overstating the effect of the strikes.",
      "Ratcliffe said on social media that the CIA\u2019s findings were based on \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d and that they contradicted what he called \u201cillegally sourced public reporting regarding the destruction of key Iranian nuclear facilities.\u201d",

Tehran may have moved the uranium soon after the first bombing raids by Israel, Grossi said.",

      "Distribution wouldn\u2019t open until the next morning, June 3, but the walk along a sea route, from Khan Younis, where they were sheltering in a tent, to Rafah, where the aid site was, would take hours. On the first day the distribution site opened, Zeidan had arrived at 9 a.m., too late to collect any food. Another day, she turned back when she heard there was gunfire near the site.",
      "By then, there had already been multiple incidents in which Palestinians were reported to have been killed while seeking aid in Gaza after a new distribution program was launched just over a week before, led by a recently founded U.S.- and Israel-backed group called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "The United Nations, which had previously run a network of hundreds of aid distribution points across Gaza but has since been sidelined by Israel, warned that reducing aid distribution to GHF\u2019s four sites would be chaotic, insufficient and dangerous. Since GHF began operations on May 26, scores of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to reach its aid distribution sites, according to the local health ministry and witnesses.",
      "The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that more than 400 Palestinians are believed to have been killed while trying to collect humanitarian aid in just under a month.",
      "The Israeli military acknowledges involvement in many of these incidents, often saying that soldiers fire warning shots or at individuals who appear to pose a threat or are in unauthorized areas. GHF says the attacks happen outside their distribution sites.",
      "Most of the deadly incidents unfolded as Palestinians traveled to the GHF distribution sites, according to Palestinian health authorities and witnesses. At least one incident unfolded as Palestinians waited to collect food from United Nations convoys, the organization has said.",
      "Zeidan would soon join the dozens killed as they struggled to secure food, underscoring the pitfalls of a new aid system in which tens of thousands of Palestinians must walk long distances \u2014 often through areas controlled by the Israeli military \u2014 to have a chance of getting a fraction of the limited aid being handed out."

      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

    "summary": "A recent scientific study concluded a woman can run one mile in under 4 minutes. In the coming days, Faith Kipyegon will test that theory on the track.",
    "story": [
      "Last winter, a study startled the running world when a team of researchers concluded that, under the right circumstances, Kenyan superstar Faith Kipyegon could break a barrier long thought impossible \u2014 becoming the first woman to run 1 mile in less than four minutes.",
      "In the coming days, under a worldwide spotlight, that theory will be put to the test.",
      "Kipyegon on Thursday will line up in Paris in a Nike-sponsored race called Breaking4, just four laps \u2014 and 1,609 meters, to be exact \u2014 from history.",
      "If there were ever a runner to make such an attempt, it would be the 31-year-old Kipyegon. A three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, who holds the world record in the 1,500 meters and formerly held the record at 5,000 meters, as well, she has come closer to the four-minute barrier than anyone. In 2023, racing in Monaco, Kipyegon smashed the previous world record for the mile by running 4:07.64.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really stretching your imagination and acceptance of how women can excel in sport,\u201d said Rodger Kram, an associate professor emeritus at the University of Colorado who co-authored the study published in February in the Royal Society of Open Science.",
      "Yet speed alone won\u2019t make up the 7.64-second difference between her personal best and a barrier-breaking achievement \u2014 a lifetime in a race as short as the mile. The big variable is how exactly Kipyegon will \u201cdraft\u201d off pace-setters around her, thus reducing her aerodynamic drag. How many pacers Nike will use, and what formation they will employ, remains a mystery.",
      "Kipyegon told The Associated Press that \u201cbreaking four will really cement my legacy.\u201d Yet breaking four minutes could lead to a wider effect. Half-marathons and marathons have enjoyed a post-pandemic participation boom, but Kram wonders whether Kipyegon\u2019s example could inspire more women to run middle distances.",
      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Iran has suffered a series of humiliating defeats brought on by the regime\u2019s own diplomatic miscalculations and strategic blunders, former officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Less than two years ago, Iran\u2019s government sounded triumphant.",
      "It was November 2023, just weeks after Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and a senior Iranian general was predicting that the regime and its proxy forces in Gaza and Lebanon were poised to vanquish Israel, the United States and other enemies.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting America, Zionism and all those who are targeting the greatness and honor of the Islamic Revolution of Iran,\u201d Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in a speech in the city of Kazvin.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of conquering great heights. ... We are completely overcoming the enemies.\u201d",
      "Now Iran is in its most precarious position since the early 1980s.",
      "Its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon have been devastated, Hamas has been eviscerated in Gaza, Tehran\u2019s nuclear sites have been heavily bombed, and Israel\u2019s military now owns the skies over Iran.",
      "As for Salami, he was killed in an Israeli airstrike this month.",
      "How Iran got here can be traced to a series of miscalculations and strategic blunders, experts and former officials say, a result of decisions made both decades and only months ago.",
      "Tehran\u2019s often obstinate diplomacy, overreliance on regional militants and shoddy security left it vulnerable to adversaries with much more powerful militaries. And at a crucial moment, the regime\u2019s leaders failed to grasp the intentions and capabilities of its arch foes in Jerusalem and Washington, with no foreign partner ready to come to its aid.",
      "\u201cIran was too inflexible when it had to be less stubborn,\u201d said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank. \u201cIt never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Among its more recent missteps, Iran failed to learn from how other countries managed their relations with President Donald Trump or how the ground had shifted after Israel devastated Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Vaez said.",
      "But perhaps Iran\u2019s biggest mistake was counting on those Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon in the first place to serve as a \u201cforward defense\u201d against any possible attack by Israel. That approach worked for years, and it dealt Israel a blow when it sent ground troops into Lebanon.",
      "But everything changed when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Iran had armed, trained and financed Hamas, and the group\u2019s onslaught set off a chain of events that has left the regime in Tehran severely weakened and its regional power diminished.",
      "\u201cI think there is a direct line from Oct. 7 to today,\u201d said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official.",
      "While Israel hammered away at Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after Oct. 7, Iran and its Hezbollah allies prepared for an eventual ground attack from Israel into Lebanon. Instead, Israel took a different tack, targeting Hezbollah\u2019s commanders and its top leader through airstrikes and booby-trapped pagers used by Hezbollah\u2019s members. Israeli forces staged only a small incursion into southern Lebanon.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former Defense Department official with the Atlantic Council think tank, said, \u201cThe dominoes that fell after Oct. 7th left Iran\u2019s proxy network in shambles, eroded deterrence and reduced its counterstrike capabilities.\u201d",
      "But he said Iran failed to adapt and refused diplomatic overtures from Washington despite its increasingly vulnerable position.",
      "Seth Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that after the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Tehran invested heavily in arming and training militias in the region through its Revolutionary Guard Corps, with Hezbollah as the anchor of an \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "The scheme worked for decades, Jones said, but it neglected the country\u2019s armed forces, which have fallen far behind.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that your conventional forces don\u2019t get the same level of focus,\u201d Jones said.",
      "During Israel\u2019s air campaign, \u201cthe Iranians were fighting an enemy that\u2019s got fifth-generation F-35 stealth aircraft.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t have an answer to that,\u201d Jones added.",
      "Iran has also faltered on the diplomatic front.",
      "In talks over its nuclear program, Iran\u2019s leaders stuck to an uncompromising stance mistakenly believing they could buy more time and secure more concessions from Trump, as well as his predecessor, Joe Biden, experts said.",
      "Over four years, Iran dragged its feet and delayed talks with the Biden administration, which had expressed a willingness to revive and revise the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump had abandoned in 2018, Western officials say.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House, his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, offered Iran a way to continue to enrich uranium for a period of years, while other countries in the region would help it develop a civilian nuclear energy program. The Israeli government and Republican hawks were worried that Trump\u2019s offer was too generous. But Iran appeared to misread Trump, calculating that it could extend the talks over a longer period, experts and Western officials say.",
      "In the end, the billions of dollars and decades of effort Iran devoted to its nuclear program \u201cprovided the nation neither nuclear energy nor deterrence,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on social media.",
      "Relying on Russia",
      "Apart from its regional network of proxy forces stretching from Lebanon to Yemen, Iran had long relied on the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad as its only genuine ally. But Sunni rebels ousted Assad in December, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers are no longer welcome in Damascus.",
      "Iran also had portrayed its increasing cooperation with Russia as a \u201cstrategic\u201d partnership, with Tehran providing thousands of Shahed drones for its war on Ukraine, as well as technical advice to help Moscow build the unnamed aircraft on Russian territory. In return, Iran acquired some Russian air defense systems, but promised fighter jets and other hardware never materialized.",
      "Over the past two weeks, Israel\u2019s air force destroyed Iran\u2019s radars and Russian anti-aircraft weaponry, with Tehran losing control over its airspace.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of providing military assistance to Iran when he met Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s hard-line rhetoric about conquering its enemies and its extensive intelligence and security apparatus, Israel has repeatedly carried out sabotage and assassinations of top military officers, nuclear scientists, the leaders of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the leaders of Hamas in Gaza. The operations have humiliated Iran\u2019s regime and shown that the country\u2019s intelligence services are unable to protect top-ranking officers or other key figures.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s entire investments in its forward defense, missiles program and nuclear capabilities evaporated in the course of 12 months of regional war and 12 days of war on its own territory,\u201d said Vaez, of the International Crisis Group. \u201cJudging by that outcome, there is no question that Iran miscalculated at every turn.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0An initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes that the U.S. airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment sites over the weekend were not as effective as President Donald Trump said and that they set the country's nuclear program back by only three to six months, according to three people with knowledge of the report.",
      "\u201cWe were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\u201d said one of the three sources. \u201cThis assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That\u2019s a bad sign for the overall program.\u201d",
      "CNN first reported the assessment\u2019s conclusions.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the reporting on the intelligence assessment was inaccurate.",
      "\u201cThis alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as \u2018top secret\u2019 but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cEveryone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\u201d",
      "Follow along here for live coverage",
      "A White House official said defense officials continue to \u201canalyze the impact\u201d of the bombing targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "Trump declared Saturday that the Iranian nuclear program was \u201ccompletely and totally obliterated,\u201d but the top U.S. military officer was less definitive Sunday in his view as a so-called battle damage assessment was completed.",
      "\u201cFinal battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\u201d the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, said at the Pentagon."

      "Israel hailed its offensive against Iran as a success on Tuesday as it thanked its closest ally, the United States, for its role in \u201celiminating\u201d the Iranian nuclear threat.",
      "But experts say those celebrations are most likely premature, with an accurate picture of the impact of U.S. and Israeli strikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program unclear and hundreds of pounds of enriched uranium still unaccounted for.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too soon for the United States or Israel to claim that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been destroyed,\u201d Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Too soon to tell",
      "While President Donald Trump claimed over the weekend that the U.S. had \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated\u201d Tehran\u2019s key nuclear sites, including Fordo, buried deep under a mountain, Isfahan and Natanz, the full impact of the strikes remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, nearly 400 kilograms, or 880 pounds, of uranium enriched to 60% purity is still publicly unaccounted for.",
      "Follow along for live coverage.",
      "Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons, but its rapid acceleration in uranium enrichment, as reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sparked alarm before Israel\u2019s and the U.S.\u2019 strikes. Power plants require the radioactive metal to be enriched to only 3%-5%, whereas 90% is required to build a nuclear warhead.",
      "Rafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, on Sunday said that damage was visible at the Fordo and Natanz sites after American B-2 Spirit bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator munitions, also known as \u201cbunker busters.\u201d Submarine-fired Tomahawk cruise missiles hit targets at Isfahan.",
      "But he said \u201cno one\u201d including his agency was \u201cin a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo\u201d as he called for inspectors to be allowed to visit Iran\u2019s nuclear sites to account for the stockpiles of uranium and, in particular, \u201cthe 400kg enriched to 60%.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Israel declared its operation against Iran a success as it said it had agreed to a shaky ceasefire announced earlier by Trump.",
      "Trump accused both sides of violating the ceasefire, telling reporters he was going to see if he could bring an end to the infractions as he looks to force Tehran back to the negotiations on its nuclear program.",
      "Was enriched uranium moved?",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the enriched uranium might have been moved before the U.S. launched its strikes on Saturday.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., suggested Monday in an interview with CNBC that U.S. intelligence had found that Iran did not move nuclear material from its Fordo facility before the U.S. attack.",
      "NBC News was not able to independently verify that.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had warned IAEA director Grossi in a letter on June 13 that Iran would adopt \u201cspecial measures to protect our nuclear equipment and materials.\u201d",
      "Images taken two days before the U.S. strike on Fordo released by Maxar Technologies, which provides satellite images used by various government agencies, show 16 cargo trucks on an access road leading up to the nuclear enrichment facility, with images captured the following day showing the trucks had moved away from the sites."

      "On Monday, Iran fired back at the U.S. with a strike on the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in what is already being seen as merely a face-saving gesture. Qatar said it had intercepted the Iranian missiles and condemned the attack, calling it a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "But even as Middle Eastern leaders were quick to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s paradigm-shifting assault on Iran following 10 days of Israeli bombardment, the American strikes are likely to be accepted \u2014 and even privately cheered \u2014 by an Arab officialdom that has long seen Shia Iran as the primary threat to regional stability.",
      "\u201cThese countries are quietly delighted to see Iran cut down to size,\u201d said Firas Maksad, the managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group. \u201cBut the primary objective is to guard against blowback targeting them.\u201d",
      "Statements from the governments of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for example, have stopped short of condemning the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, instead only issuing expressions of concern over an expanding regional conflict.",
      "The statement from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates didn\u2019t even mention the United States by name. The most recent comments contrast with the countries\u2019 strong condemnations of Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran over the past 10 days."
