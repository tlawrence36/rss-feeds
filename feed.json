      "\u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d has once again placed first on the box office charts",
      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $145 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 115% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, it's running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "The appointment of the 45-year-old Venezuelan-Armenian, the husband of soprano Sonya Yoncheva, was announced Friday night. Conlon has been music director since 2006-07 and said in March 2024 that he will retire after after the 2025-26 season.",
      "\u201cLA is a city that is known by innovation, taking risks in productions and musically,\u201d Hindoyan said in New York, where his wife is currently singing at the Metropolitan Opera. \u201cThe idea is to do new pieces, commissions and modern pieces, something to really have a balance between what is classic and go further as much as we can.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan will conduct two productions in 2026-27 and three in each of the following four seasons, LA Opera President Christopher Koelsch said. Koelsch hopes Hindoyan can lead works with Yoncheva, who has not sung a staged production at the LA Opera.",
      "Like other companies, the LA Opera has struggled with increased costs following the pandemic and scrapped a planned pair of world premieres over finances. Tenor and conductor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was a key figure in fundraising for the company as general director from 2003-19.",
      "\u201cPart of my job as a music director and the job of any musician is to really take care of the art form as much as we can,\" Hindoyan said, \"not only on stage, not only studying at home (but also) the connection with the community and the connection to the donors.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan was born in Caracas, played violin and is a product of El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system that was instrumental in the careers of Gustavo Dudamel and Rafael Payare. He was an assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper unter den Linden.",
      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him. In my experience, he almost always coaxes the best out of people,\" Koelsch said. \u201cThe 'Rom\u00e9o' run for me was kind of a test run of how those qualities resonated inside our building, how it worked with the orchestra and the chorus and the administration and the audiences.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Alf Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer whose music provided essential accompaniment for the animated antics of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died.",
      "His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson's Disease for about a decade. He was 84.",
      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\"no relation,\" he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d winning twice.",
      "Al Jean, an early \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said in a post on X Friday that \u201cClausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.\"",
      "While Danny Elfman wrote the show's theme song, Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio.",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show's comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation\u2019s capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties",
      "WASHINGTON -- One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation's capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that unforeseen circumstances have forced the cancellation\u201d of the concert, the Capital Pride Alliance, the main World Pride organizer, said in a Friday statement. \u201cUpdates about the relocated Opening Ceremony program will be released as soon as they are finalized!\u201d",
      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",
      "\u201cDue to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira\u2019s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park,\u201d the Capital Pride Alliance statement said. \u201cDespite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.\u201d",
      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",
      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",
      "Capital Pride Alliance Executive Director Ryan Bos said that security fencing would be installed surrounding the final two-day concert and rally on a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Early hotel reservation numbers for the final World Pride weekend, June 6-8, were originally down from the previous year, according to Destination D.C., which tracks reservations.",
      "But Destination D.C. President Elliott Ferguson told reporters on Thursday that, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing now is a surge at the last minute, especially with the national community.\u201d",
      "Ferguson speculated that concerns about international attendance had \u201cgalvanized the local community, the national community to want to come to the city.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The nation's public television service, PBS, has filed suit against President Donald Trump's executive order that it be stripped of federal funding",
      "PBS filed suit Friday against President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days after NPR did the same for its radio network.",
      "In its lawsuit, PBS relies on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d because of his claim that PBS' news coverage is biased against conservatives.",
      "\u201cPBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d lawyer Z.W. Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cBut regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\u201d",
      "It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organizations impacted by Trump's orders.",
      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

    "story": [
      "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "NEW YORK -- Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan, the demanding head nurse of a behind-the-lines surgical unit during the Korean War on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d has died. She was 87.",
      "Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.",
      "Swit and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d which was based on Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H. Richard Hornberger.",
      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.",
      "In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.",
      "Despite the fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn\u2019t even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.",
      "On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior.",
      "And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.",
      "But the Marseille mural wasn\u2019t meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that\u2019s already circling the world.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child, palace officials confirmed Friday, though they gave no details, saying she is no longer a royal member.",
      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",
      "Officials said that while the birth involved a former royal, the palace decided to publicly confirm the news after media reports earlier this month on the baby's arrival. They added that they hoped Mako would live in a quiet environment.",
      "Mako's parents, Crown Prince Akishino and his wife Kiko, and younger siblings \u2014 Princess Kako and Prince Hisahito \u2014 are delighted and wished Mako's family happiness, officials said.",
      "Japanese tabloid magazine Josei Seven recently published images of Mako and Kei Komuro seen walking with a baby stroller in a neighborhood of New York.",
      "Mako and her husband met at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. They announced in September 2017 their intention to marry the following year, but the wedding was suspended for four years due to a financial dispute involving Kei Komuro's mother.",
      "Due to the controversy, Mako also declined a dowry to which she was entitled for leaving the imperial family.",
      "Mako\u2019s loss of royal status comes from the Imperial House Law, which allows only male succession.",
      "The rule leaves only Akishino and his son Hisahito in line to succeed Naruhito. A government panel is discussing a more stable succession system, but conservatives reject female succession and only plan to allow female royals to help perform public duties after marriage.",

      "LONDON -- Actor and comedian Russell Brand pleaded not guilty in a London court Friday to rape and sexual assault charges involving four women dating back more than 25 years.",
      "Brand, who turns 50 next week, denied two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. He said \"not guilty\u201d after each charge was read in Southwark Crown Court.",
      "His trial was scheduled for June 3, 2026 and is expected to last four to five weeks.",
      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",
      "When the charges were announced last month, he said that he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cI was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,\u201d he said in a social media video. \u201cI was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I\u2019ve never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\u201d",

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",
      "The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.",
      "Jiseok credits BTS\u2019s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM\u2019s donation to his former school \u2014 a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students \u2014 gave him access to music and dance for the first time. \u201cWithout those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,\u201d he said.",
      "Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.",
      "\u201cWe recently saw Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,\u201d PJ said. \u201cAll of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I\u2019d also love to work with Billie Eilish.\u201d",
      "As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked playing it safe \u2014 even with food, I only ate what I was used to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through Big Ocean, I\u2019ve gained confidence in trying new things. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most satisfied with.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II. In one clip, she is seen lifting the flag from the floor and draping it over another artwork, an action Tipu said she would repeat daily.",
      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",
      "The Nelson gallery didn't suggest in its statement that police involvement had influenced Thursday's decision.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "Trump's status as a \u201ccontent creator\u201d was also damaged by attention given to the interview, lawyers said. It was part of their argument opposing CBS parent Paramount Global's effort to dismiss the president's $20 billion lawsuit against the company, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. Trump has claimed the editing was done to advantage Harris, which CBS rejects.",
      "Even with the effort to dismiss the case, Paramount is engaged in settlement discussions with Trump. The prospect of a settlement has so rattled CBS News that two of its top executives have resigned in protest.",
      "Trump, who did not agree to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\" during the campaign, has protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show's Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier in the day. CBS said each reply came within Harris' long-winded answer to Whitaker, but was edited to be more succinct.",

      "CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico -- Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing were found in the northern city of Reynosa, along the Texas border, authorities said on Thursday.",
      "The musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, which played at parties and local dances in the region, had been reported missing since Sunday.",
      "The genre they played \u2013 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2013 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists have mixed the classic genre with trap and sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the group played such songs, other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "Few details were released about where the bodies were found and in what conditions, but Tamaulipas state prosecutors had been investigating the case, according to a statement by state security officials. The last time they had communicated with their families was Sunday night, when they said they were going to a venue where they were hired to play.",
      "After that, nothing else was heard of them. Officials said the bodies shared characteristics of artists, though did not provide further detail.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",

      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",

Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year.

      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system.

The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A verdict is expected in one of France's largest-ever child sex abuse cases",
      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",

      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",

      "Experts warned of startling low turnout in the lead up to the historic elections due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the novelty of voting for judges. Experts say those factors may throw into question the legitimacy of the election, which has faced months of fierce scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum, a member of Mexico\u2019s ruling party, Morena, rejected the criticisms and insisted the election would only only make Mexico more democratic and root out corruption in a system that most people in the country believe is broken.",
      "\u201cWhoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\u201d she said. \u201cMexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\u201d",
      "While some voters said they felt pushed to vote in an election they felt would determine the fate of the country\u2019s democracy, many more expressed a deep sense of apathy, citing disillusionment due to decades of corruption and lack of basic information about the vote.",
      "\u201cI'm not interested (in voting). Parties and their messages \u2014 they come and they go. It's all the same,\u201d said Raul Bernal, a 50-year-old factory worker in downtown Mexico City walking is dog.",
      "Even without the final tally, the results of the vote are set to transform Mexico's judiciary. Morena overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.",
      "\u201cIt's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side\" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. \u201cBut it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.\u201d",
      "Instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters have cast ballots to choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.",
      "Some of the country's voting centers opened with only a trickle of people and small lines forming throughout the day.",
      "Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn\u2019t agree with electing judges and doesn\u2019t support Morena, but came to vote because \u201csince there isn\u2019t much participation, my vote will count more.\u201d",
      "He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates. Other critics said they only voted for the Supreme Court and other top courts.",
      "Francisco Torres de Le\u00f3n, a 62-year-old retired teacher in southern Mexico, called the process \"painstaking because there are too many candidates and positions that they\u2019re going to fill.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had pushed through the judicial reform but remained out of the public eye since leaving office last year, voted in Chiapas near his ranch.",
      "\u201cI wanted to participate in this historic election,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the history of our country \u2026 have the people decided and had the right to elect judges.\u201d",
      "The process has raised concerns.",
      "Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.",
      "Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.",
      "Others like Martha Tamayo, a lawyer and former congresswoman from conflict-ravaged Sinaloa, cast doubt on projections that the election could hand even more power over to criminals and criminal groups, simply because they already have a strong control over courts.",
      "\u201cThe influence of criminal groups already exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cartels go with the judges (bribe them) whether they are elected or not.\u201d",
      "The public has been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.",
      "As a result, many Mexicans said they were going into the vote blind, though others voting Sunday noted they supported the process despite the confusion.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.",
      "\u201cPolitical parties weren\u2019t just going to sit with their arms crossed,\u201d Patin said.",
      "While still unsure if his vote would improve access to justice for many Mexicans, 61-year-old actor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Contreras defended the election, Sheinbaum and her party. He cast his ballot with a tone of hope.",
      "\u201cThe reform has its problems but we needed an urgent change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to start with something.\u201d",

      "Poles awakened Monday to a clear albeit close result that returns a nationalist politician to the presidency who has pledged to hinder the centrist, pro-EU government for the remainder of its term.",
      "Here's what to know about Karol Nawrocki, Poland\u2019s newly elected conservative president:",
      "Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who had no political experience prior to the campaign and who was not even a party member until he was tapped by the conservative Law and Justice party that governed Poland from 2015 to 2023.",
      "Nawrocki heads the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland. Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Many of them oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ visibility and say Nawrocki reflects the traditional values they grew up with.",
      "He was also the preferred favorite of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the American conservative group CPAC holding its first meeting in Poland last week during the campaign to give him a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised him and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "His campaign echoed themes popular on the American right. A common refrain from his supporters is that Nawrocki will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags appeared at his rallies.",
      "Nawrocki performed better in the first round than expected, an indication he was underestimated in the polling.",
      "Nawrocki's quick political rise has not been without controversy, with reports linking him to underworld figures whom he met while boxing or working as a hotel security guard in the past.",
      "Nawrocki has also been linked to a scandal involving the acquisition of a Gdansk apartment from an elderly pensioner named Jerzy. Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home.",
      "His shifting explanations raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity.",
      "It recently emerged that Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk brawl involving about 140 rival soccer fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\u201d combat.",
      "Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.",
      "His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state but many right-wing voters don\u2019t believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.",
      "It's unclear what effect, if any, these scandals had on the outcome of Sunday's result.",

      "The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",

      "Conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After months of political turmoil, South Korea will elect a new president this week to succeed conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his brief but shocking imposition of martial law.",
      "Surveys suggested liberal Lee Jae-myung is heavily favored to win Tuesday's snap election, riding on a wave of public disappointment of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle in December. The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, wants a come-from-behind victory, but observers say his refusal to directly criticize Yoon made it difficult for him to narrow the gap with Lee.",
      "The winner will be sworn in as president on Wednesday without the typical two-month transition period. The new leader faces the urgent tasks of trying to heal the deep domestic divide over Yoon's action as well as focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump's America-first policy and North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "Lee, who represents the main liberal Democratic Party, is the favorite to win the elections. In three Gallup Korea surveys released last week, 46% to 49% of respondents picked Lee as their choice for next president, giving him a comfortable lead over Kim with 35% to 37%.",
      "Lee narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, and spearheaded parliament\u2019s two votes to overturn Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and impeach him, before the Constitutional Court formally dismissed him in April.",
      "Lee\u2019s outspoken criticism of South Korea's conservative establishment and calls to punish those involved in Yoon's martial law enactment have caused worries among his opponents that Lee's election would further polarize the country.",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, has fought an uphill battle against Lee as his People Power Party struggles to restore public confidence. Kim's opposition to Yoon's impeachment and reluctance to explicitly criticize the disgraced leader drove him away from moderate voters, analysts say.",
      "Four other politicians are running for the presidency, including Lee Jun-seok of the small conservative New Reform Party, who has categorically rejected Kim's request to field a unified candidate between them to prevent a split in conservative votes.",
      "The election has got ugly, with candidates levelling damaging statements, personal attacks and even sexually offensive language against each other without unveiling clear, long-term vision for South Korea.",
      "During last week's televised debate, Lee Jae-myung labelled Kim as \"Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s avatar,\u201d while Kim called Lee a \u201charbinger of monster politics and dictatorship.\u201d Lee Jun-seok faced withering public criticism after he used graphic references to women\u2019s bodies to criticize Lee Jae-myung's son over his purported sexually explicit online slur targeting a female singer.",
      "Unlike past elections, North Korea's nuclear program hasn't emerged as a hot-button topic, suggesting that most candidates share a view that South Korea has few immediate ways to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons. Dealing with Trump's aggressive tariffs policy hasn't been a divisive issue either.",
      "Kim has instead focused on portraying Lee Jae-myung as a dangerous leader who would likely wield excessive power by putting the judiciary under his control and revising laws to stop his criminal trials. Lee Jae-myung, for his part, has repeatedly questioned Kim's ties with Yoon.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new president will have little time to negotiate with the United States before July 9, when Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on global tariffs expires, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates. A U.S. federal court has recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose the tariffs, but the White House has appealed, leaving the long-term outcome unclear.",
      "South Korea's outgoing administration was trying to finalize a comprehensive \u201cpackage\u201d deal with the U.S. by early July to soften the blow to the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "Lee has accused government officials of rushing negotiations for short-term political gains and said it wouldn\u2019t serve national interests to obsess over securing an early agreement with Washington. Kim said he would place a priority on a meeting with Trump as soon as possible to resolve trade issues.",
      "The next government in Seoul may also struggle to ease security tensions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program, which has been complicated by North Korea's support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Lee has expressed a willingness to improve ties with North Korea but acknowledged that it would be difficult to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon. He said he would support Trump's push to resume nuclear diplomacy with North Korea. Kim Moon Soo has promised to build up South Korea's military capability and win a stronger U.S. security support, suggesting he would uphold Yoon's hard-line approach on North Korea.",
      "The most pressing domestic issue facing the new president will be a starkly divided nation that had seen millions rallying for months to either support or denounce Yoon.",
      "Yoon had labeled Lee\u2019s party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. He also endorsed unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that the liberals had benefited from election fraud, prompting his supporters to rally in the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs.",
      "Lee has issued a message of unity and vowed not to seek political vengeance against his rivals if elected. But his critics doubt that, suspecting Lee could use investigations of Yoon's martial law decree as a vehicle to suppress his opponents.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal saga is likely to overshadow the early months of Seoul\u2019s next government, as the former president continues to stand trial on high-stakes rebellion charges, which carry a possible sentence of death or life in prison.",

      "The death toll from devastating flooding in a market town in Nigeria\u2019s north-central state of Niger rose to at least 200 on Sunday, a local official said",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- The death toll from devastating flooding in a market town in Nigeria\u2019s north-central state of Niger rose to at least 200 on Sunday, a local official said.",
      "Torrents of predawn rainfall early Thursday unleashed the devastating flood on Mokwa, nearly 380 kilometers (236 miles) west of Abuja and a major trading and transportation hub where northern Nigerian farmers sell beans, onions and other food to traders from the south.",
      "The deputy chairman of Mokwa Local Government, Musa Kimboku, confirmed the updated fatality count to The Associated Press on Sunday. He said rescue operations have been called off, as authorities no longer believe there are any survivors.",
      "To prevent the outbreak of disease, officials are currently exhuming bodies buried beneath the rubble, Kimboku added.",
      "On Saturday, the spokesperson for the Niger State emergency service, Ibrahim Audu Husseini, said an additional 11 people were injured and more than 3,000 people were displaced.",
      "At least 500 households across three communities were affected by the sudden and intense flood that built rapidly in about five hours, leaving roofs barely visible and surviving residents waist-deep in water, trying to salvage what they could and rescue others.",
      "Husseini added that two roads were washed away and two bridges collapsed.",
      "In a statement on Friday night, President Bola Tinubu expressed condolences and said he had directed the activation of an emergency response to support victims and \u201caccelerate\u201d recovery.",
      "Flooding is common during Nigeria\u2019s wet season. Communities in northern Nigeria have been experiencing prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change and excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during the brief wet season. But this flood has been particularly deadly in Mokwa, a farming region near the banks of the River Niger.",
      "Mokwa community leader Aliki Musa said the villagers are not used to such flooding.",
      "The chairman of the Mokwa local government area, Jibril Muregi, told local news website Premium Times that construction of flood-control works was long overdue.",

    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom is shifting its stance on the disputed Western Sahara, backing Morocco's plan to offer its people limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty",
      "RABAT, Morocco -- The United Kingdom on Sunday became the latest country to back Morocco\u2019s position on the disputed Western Sahara, calling its plan to keep the territory under Moroccan control \u201cthe most credible, viable and pragmatic\u201d way to resolve the decades-long conflict.",
      "At a joint press conference in Morocco's capital, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the United Kingdom was changing its position to support Morocco's plan to offer the area limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. He and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita lauded the two countries' ties on security and trade, noting Morocco's role as co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.",
      "\"The time for a resolution and to move this issue forward is long-overdue, and would strengthen the stability of North Africa,\" Lammy said.",
      "He also reiterated support for the United Nations-led process and called on Morocco to \u201cexpand on details of what autonomy within the Moroccan State could entail for the region.\u201d",
      "Western Sahara is a strip of coastal desert rich in phosphates and fish that the United Nations has considered a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d throughout almost 50 years of dispute. It's claimed by both Morocco and Polisario, a pro-independence group that operates out of refugee camps in southwestern Algeria.",
      "The shift fulfills one of Morocco's primary foreign policy objectives and makes the United Kingdom the third permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to back its position, following France and the United States. Since 1991, the United Nations has administered a peacekeeping mission designed to hold a referendum to determine the status of the disputed territory, all of which is under Morocco's control except for a small sliver near the Algerian border.",
      "After years of conflict, the area has recently emerged as a hotspot for investment, drawing European and American firms interested in fishing, agriculture and infrastructure projects that would allow for the transmission of wind and solar power. As negotiations have stalled, Morocco has invested heavily in the region and sought support from trade partners. Polisario has taken its fight to international courts, arguing that Morocco does not have the right to trade resources belonging to the Sahrawi people while the conflict remains unresolved.",
      "The countries exchange billions of dollars worth of cars, fruits and vegetables. The two are partnering on XLinks, a renewable energy storage and transmission project whose backers hope will power millions of British homes.",
      "The British shift angered Algeria, Morocco's regional rival, which in a statement on Sunday blasted Morocco's plan as \u201cempty of content and incapable of contributing to a serious and credible settlement of the conflict.\u201d",
      "Polisario Front representatives didn\u2019t respond to questions about the United Kingdom's stance.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of people on Sunday vowed to keep on fighting for justice and rule of law in Serbia as they demanded that President Aleksandar Vucic call a snap parliamentary election following months of persistent demonstrations that have challenged his firm grip on power in the Balkan country.",
      "Protesters led by university students blocked bridges in the capital Belgrade and rallied in 30 other Serbian cities and towns as they also marked exactly seven months since a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the north, killing 16 people and sparking the massive wave of anti-corruption protests.",
      "\u201cThe whole of Serbia has risen,\u201d protesting students said in a speech that was read at all the rallies at the same time. \u201cThere will be no more silence, there will be no more surrender!\u201d",
      "Many people in Serbia believe that the deadly Nov. 1 canopy collapse in Novi Sad was the result of flawed renovation work on the station building, and they link the disaster to alleged government corruption in major infrastructure projects with Chinese state companies.",
      "Vucic, whom critics have accused of imposing authoritarian rule in Serbia since coming to power over a decade ago, initially dismissed the possibility of holding early elections but on Friday suggested they could take place, though without saying exactly when.",
      "Sunday's protests included commemoration ceremonies for the victims of the Novi Sad crash and student marches and blockades. In Belgrade, crowds halted traffic at two key bridges over the Sava River for three hours, while protesters in Novi Sad carried a white wreath for the canopy collapse victims as they walked toward the crash site.",
      "Mina Miletic, from Belgrade, said she is encouraged by so many people fighting together for the same goal: \u201cThe rule of law and life in a decent country.\u201d",
      "Vucic has accused the protesters of working for unspecified Western powers to \u201cdestroy Serbia.\u201d Pro-government media on Sunday described the blockades in Belgrade as \u201cterror\u201d and alleged falsely that \u201conly a handful\u201d of people joined the rallies.",
      "Most media in Serbia are controlled by the ruling populists, often lashing out at government opponents and accusing them of anti-state activities.",
      "The student movement is seeking a snap vote, arguing that the current government cannot meet their demands for justice for the crash victims. Presidential and parliamentary elections are otherwise due some time in 2027.",
      "No one has been sentenced in connection with the tragedy in Novi Sad and doubts prevail that ongoing legal proceedings will uncover the alleged corruption behind the crash.",
      "Serbia is formally seeking European Union entry but the ruling populists have been accused of clamping down on democratic freedoms, including free media. Vucic's authorities have stepped up pressure on protesters, including police detentions, intimidation and physical attacks.",

      "LONDON -- For soccer-loving transgender women in England, it's been a tough day, as the ban on their participation in women's teams came into force.",
      "To show its solidarity with the community and against the decision by the governing body of English soccer (football), Goal Diggers Football Club, a London-based trans-inclusive women\u2019s team, held a tournament Sunday.",
      "The message was clear. Yes, it's a sad day, but no one will stop us playing the sport we love.",
      "Around 100 people \u2014 women, trans women, non-binary and gender non-conforming players \u2014took part in the \u201cLet The Dolls Play Tournament\u201d in Islington, north London.",
      "And everyone present appeared to find comfort in their solidarity despite the occasional foul, intentional or not.",
      "\u201cYou know they\u2019re not going take away this community, my friends,\u201d said Paula Griffin, a 60-year-old transgender woman. \"And there\u2019s such a powerful message coming from that, that the people who care about women\u2019s sport are the people who play the women\u2019s sports. And these are the people that are my friends.\u201d",
      "Griffin, like the others, are still dismayed by the decision last month by England's Football Association to ban transgender women from playing on women's soccer teams from June 1 following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in April.",
      "The F.A. said it had decided to change its rules that had allowed transgender athletes to play in women's soccer teams if they had reduced testosterone levels.",
      "The decision came in the wake of the ruling from the U.K.'s Supreme Court that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it was condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really upset me,\u201d said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old transgender woman. \"I have to say, this has been a really hard week. I\u2019ve struggled to get out of bed at times. I\u2019m doing my best to get through work and come to things like this, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d",
      "The issue has been polarizing in the U.K. and beyond, particularly in the United States, where President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to prohibit participation of transgender athletes in sports and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court.",
      "For those present at the tournament in north London on Sunday morning, the fight will go on but for now, it's about keeping the sport they love close.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the whole point of today, is we\u2019re trying to just reclaim the day and make it a really joyous time to spend together,\u201d said Jahnavi Kalayil, a 26-year-old woman. \"And I think it\u2019s definitely happened, everyone\u2019s had a really great time. Whether winning or losing the games, it\u2019s more about just coming together as a community and making sure we\u2019re standing up for our trans siblings.\u201d",

      "Two U.S. senators are warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling on peace while preparing a fresh military offensive against Ukraine",
      "PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe\u2019s security map.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.",
      "In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who they say is \u201c100% aligned\u201d with them on the war \u2014 the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing. A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West\u2019s last chance to choke off the Kremlin\u2019s war economy, they said.",
      "\"What I learned on this trip was he\u2019s preparing for more war,\u201d Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation \u201cbone-crushing\u201d and said it would place Russia\u2019s economy \u201con a trade island.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,\u201d he said.",
      "At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports \u2014 targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.",
      "Graham called it \u201cthe most draconian bill I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.\"",
      "\u201cThe world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.\u201d",
      "Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal \u2014 a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.",
      "\u201cPutin is playing President Trump,\" Blumenthal said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking him for a sucker.\u201d The senator said Putin \"is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.\u201d",
      "Graham added: \u201cWe saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He\u2019s preparing for more war.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see it.\u201d Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump\u2019s advisers.",
      "Graham backed the president\u2019s diplomatic instincts but said, \"By trying to engage Putin \u2014 by being friendly and enticing \u2014 it\u2019s become painfully clear he\u2019s not interested in ending this war.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate \u2014 and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office\u2014 may help shift the conversation.",
      "\u201cHe needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,\u201d he said of Putin.",
      "In Kyiv, the senators said, the war\u2019s human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia \u2014 calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.",
      "Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. \u201cPutin is a thug. He\u2019s a murderer.\"",
      "Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.",
      "After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.",

      "The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.",
      "That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago partly on disillusionment with the previous Conservative administration 's efforts to get a grip on the the numbers making the crossing.",
      "Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the U.K. by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.",
      "Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.",
      "French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.",
      "\u201cPretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,\" Defense Secretary John Healey told Sky News.",
      "He added that it is a \u201creally big problem\u201d that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the U.K. is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not doing it, but, but for the first time for years \u2026 we\u2019ve got the level of cooperation needed,\" he told Sky News. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.\u201d",
      "Despite French and U.K. efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.",
      "The Home Office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.",

      "The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal directed investigators to produce Hasina, a former home minister and a former police chief before the court on June 16.",
      "Hasina has been in exile in India since Aug. 5, 2024, while former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan is missing and possibly also in India. Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun has been arrested. Bangladesh sent a formal request to India to extradite Hasina in December.",
      "State-run Bangladesh Television broadcast the court proceedings live.",

      "In an investigation report submitted on May 12, the tribunal\u2019s investigators brought five allegations of crimes against humanity against Hasina and the two others during the mass uprising in July-August last year.",
      "According to the charges, Hasina was directly responsible for ordering all state forces, her Awami League party and its associates to carry out actions that led to mass killings, injuries, targeted violence against women and children, the incineration of bodies and denial of medical treatment to the wounded.",
      "The charges describe Hasina as the \u201cmastermind, conductor, and superior commander\u201d of the atrocities.",
      "Three days after Hasina's ouster, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the nation's interim leader.",
      "The Yunus-led administration, which has already banned the Awami League party, amended relevant laws to allow for the trial of the former ruling party for its role during the uprising.",
      "In February, the U.N. human rights office estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks in the crackdown on the student-led protests against Hasina, who ruled the country for 15 years.",
      "The tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladesh\u2019s independence war in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war against Pakistan. Aided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father and the country\u2019s first leader.",
      "In a separate development, Bangladesh\u2019s Supreme Court on Sunday cleared the path for the Jamaat-e-Islami party to regain its registration as a political party after a decade \u2014 a decision that would enable the party to take part in elections.",
      "The country\u2019s top court overturned a previous High Court verdict and said it is now up to the Election Commission to formally restore the registration of Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party and their election symbol.",
      "Yunus said his administration would hold the election by June next year, but the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's archrival, wants the election to be held in December this year. The relation between Zia's party, which is the largest in absence of Hasina's party, and the Yunus-led government has recently been frosty over the polls schedule.",

      "The British government is about to outline the biggest increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War as it seeks to send \u201ca message to Moscow.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. is about to see the biggest increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War as it seeks to send \"a message to Moscow,\" the British defense secretary said Sunday.",
      "John Healey said the Labour government's current plans for defense spending will be enough to transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a historic low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "He said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027, which amounts to an extra 13 billion pounds ($17 billion) or so a year, were \u201con track\u201d and that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d it would hit 3% in the next parliament in the early 2030s.",
      "The government will on Monday respond to a strategic defense review, overseen by Healey and led by Lord George Robertson, a former NATO secretary general and defense secretary in a previous Labour government.",
      "It is expected to be the most consequential review since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and make a series of recommendations for the U.K. to deal with the new threat environment, both on the military front and in cyberspace.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been compelled to take a closer look at its defense spending since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a message to Moscow,\u201d Healey told the BBC. \u201cThis is Britain standing behind, making our armed forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight, if required.\u201d",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has also piled pressure on NATO members to bolster their defense spending. And in recent months, European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",
      "Healey also said Russia is \u201cattacking the U.K. daily\u201d as part of some 90,000 cyber attacks from state-linked sources that were directed at the U.K,\u2019s defense over the last two years. A cyber command to counter such threats is expected to be set up as part of the review.",
      "\u201cThe tensions are greater but we prepare for war in order to secure the peace,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re strong enough to defeat an enemy, you deter them from attacking in the first place.\u201d",
      "While on a visit to a factory on Saturday where Storm Shadow missiles are assembled, Healey said the government would support the procurement of up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons and that new funding will see U.K. munitions spending hitting 6 billion pounds in the coming years.",
      "\u201cSix billion over the next five years in factories like this which allow us not just to produce the munitions that equip our forces for the future but to create the jobs in every part of the U.K.,\u201d he said.",
      "Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary for the main opposition Conservative Party, welcomed the government\u2019s pledge to increase defense spending but said he was \u201cskeptical\u201d as to whether the Treasury would deliver. He called on the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3% of national income within this parliament, which can run until 2029.",
      "\u201cWe think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation,\u201d he told Sky News.",

The IAEA did not immediately return a request for comment about the phone call.",

    "story": [
      "Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, as its next president \u2014 a win that signals a turn to the right in one of the European Union's member states",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe.",
      "Nawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country\u2019s domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.",
      "Here are some key takeaways:",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions.",
      "The 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland's sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.",
      "His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right \u2014 even the far right in recent times.",
      "Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.",
      "As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.",
      "But Tusk's coalition \u2014 a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives \u2014 has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.",
      "Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk\u2019s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.",
      "Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.",
      "Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.",
      "Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.",
      "While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid \u2014 particularly support for refugees.",
      "His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland\u2019s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki\u2019s approach could shift Poland\u2019s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.",
      "The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk\u2019s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.",
      "Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.",
      "While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki\u2019s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels\u2019 efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.",
      "Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.",
      "Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.",

      "And in response to recent comments by Trump, it said of the U.S.: \u201cInstead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.\u201d",
      "Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.",
      "Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and \u201chopefully we\u2019ll work that out,\u201d while still insisting China had violated the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",
      "\u201cRising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,\u201d says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies \u201cwithout aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it\u2019s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the U.S.\u201d",
      "That promise, though, could be at odds with his pledge to reduce food costs.",
      "Rising grocery prices, Trump has said, were among the biggest reasons voters swung his way. A look around a supermarket makes clear how many products could be impacted by new taxes on steel and aluminum, from beer and soda to dog food to can after can of beans, fruit, tomato paste and more.",
      "\u201cIt plays into the hands of China and other foreign canned food producers, which are more than happy to undercut American farmers and food producers,\u201d insists Can Manufacturers Institute president Robert Budway. \u201cDoubling the steel tariff will further increase the cost of canned goods at the grocery store.\u201d",
      "Budway says production by domestic tin mill steel producers, whose products are used in cans, have dramatically decreased in recent years, making manufacturers reliant on imported materials. When those prices go up, he says, \u201cthe cost is levied upon millions of American families.\u201d",
      "Food companies were already warily assessing the administration\u2019s tariffs before the latest hike, which Trump said would go into effect on Wednesday. The Campbell Co., whose soup cans are a staple for millions of Americans, has said it was working to mitigate the impact of tariffs but may be forced to raise prices. ConAgra Brands, which puts everything from cans of Reddi-Whip to cooking sprays like Pam on supermarket shelves, likewise has pointed to the impact steel and aluminum tariffs have.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t get all of our materials from the US because there\u2019s no supply,\u201d ConAgra CFO David Marberger said at a recent Goldman Sachs conference on global staples.",
      "Beyond the obvious products \u2014 canned foods like tuna, chicken broth and cranberry sauce \u2014 economists warn of a spillover effect that tariffs can have on a gamut of items. If the cost to build a store or buy a truck to haul food rise, the prices of products may follow.",
      "Most Americans will never buy a tractor, but Babak Hafezi, who runs a global consulting firm and teaches international business at American University, says a price spike in such a big-ticket item vital to food production will spill down to all sorts of other items.",
      "\u201cIf a John Deere tractor costs 25% more, consumers pay the price for that,\u201d Hafezi says. \u201cThis trickles down the economy and impacts every aspect of the economy. Some of the trickling is immediate and others are slower to manifest themselves. But yes, prices will increase and choices will decrease.\u201d",
      "Trump appeared before a crowd of cheering steelworkers to unveil the new tariffs at a rally outside Pittsburgh. In a statement, David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International union, called tariffs \u201ca valuable tool in balancing the scales\u201d but \u201cwider reforms of our global trading system\" are needed.",
      "It may be harder to gauge the weight of tariffs on, say, a can of chickpeas versus that of a new car, but consumers are likely to see myriad indirect costs from the levies, says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade.",
      "\u201cAnybody who\u2019s directly connected to the steel industry, they\u2019re going to benefit. It\u2019s just coming at a very high cost,\u201d Waldkirch says. \u201cYou may get a few more steel jobs. But all these indirect costs mean you then destroy jobs elsewhere. If you were to add that all in, you come up with a pretty large negative loss.\u201d",

      "Black women are starting to pay more for their hair care because of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on goods imported from China",
      "ATLANTA -- Before the oppressive summer heat descends on Atlanta, therapist Brittanee Sims usually gets her thick, curly hair braided at a salon to preserve her healthy mane.",
      "But it\u2019s more expensive this year. So she'll only pay for her teenage daughter and son to get their summer hairdos. Not having braided hair \u201ccreates more of a hassle for everything,\u201d said Sims, who counts herself among the tens of millions of women that regularly spend on the Black hair care industry.",
      "Now, she said, she has to \u201cgo home and figure out what I\u2019m gonna do to my hair in the morning, after I went to the gym and it\u2019s messed up with sweating and frizz.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices for products many Black women consider essential, squeezing shoppers and stylists even more as they grapple with inflation and higher rents. Much of the synthetic braiding hair, human hair for extensions, wigs and weaves, styling tools, braiding gel and other products is imported from or has packaging from China, which was subject to a combined 145% tariff in April. India also is a major global source of human hair.",
      "Many Black women have hair types and workplace-favored styles that require careful attention, and they can spend hundreds of dollars at salons each month on extensions, weaves, wigs and braids. The Associated Press spoke with several Black hair industry experts, beauty supply store owners, and wholesale companies, as well as nearly two dozen Black stylists and braiders, some of whom may have to raise prices even as business has slowed.",
      "On Thursday, a federal appeals court reinstated most of Trump's tariffs on imported goods after they were blocked the day before by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Earlier this month, the United States agreed to drop the 145% tax on goods imported from China to 30% while the two economic superpowers negotiate new trade agreements. Imports from most other countries face baseline tariff rates at 10%.",
      "Regardless, the next few months \u201care already shot\u201d for many items, said Marty Parker, a University of Georgia business professor and supply chain expert who worked in the hair care industry. The costs companies have been facing at ports are making their way down to consumers, supply shortages are getting worse, and it's unclear what will happen if negotiations break down.",
      "\u201cPrices go up very fast and come down very slow,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Some stylists said they're seeing fewer clients because prices are going up for virtually everything.",
      "Atlanta stylists are paying more for hair from China. Atlanta stylist Yana Ellis, who also sells products like wigs, paid an extra $245 in shipping for 52 bundles of hair in March compared to 40 bundles in December. AaNiyah Butler said her shipping costs for human hair more than doubled from February to May. And Dajiah Blackshear found in early May that a beauty supply store raised the cost of the kind of hair she\u2019s used for years by $100.",
      "The store owner said he may have to stop selling that brand of hair because it went up so much. Similarly, some wholesale hair stores have seen higher costs or are expecting them in the coming weeks. Even the typical $6 to $10 cost of a pack of synthetic hair has crept up.",
      "Blackshear doesn't want clients to bring hair because she likes to vet the quality. But if expenses continue to mount, she may have to raise her prices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult,\u201d she said, especially for clients who are \"having to make those hard decisions, between \u2018do I get my hair done or do I pay my bills?\u2019\u201d",
      "Janice Lowe, who runs 5 Starr Salon in a lower-income neighborhood southeast of Atlanta, has started asking clients to bring hair and is unable to purchase certain products.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m falling behind on my obligations,\u201d she said.",
      "Consultants vary on how much prices will rise, when they\u2019ll go up and for how long \u2014 and the full harm to stylists and consumers could be months away.",
      "The global Black hair care industry was worth about $3.2 billion in 2023, according to market.us, and Black women spend six times more on hair care than other ethnicities.",
      "Stylists often purchase some harder-to-get professional products from door-to-door distributors that buy from wholesale companies or larger distributors that purchase directly from other countries.",
      "Lowe has seen some of her distributors vanish altogether, making it harder to get professional lines such as Black-owned leading professional hair care brand Design Essentials, manufactured in Atlanta at McBride Research Laboratories.",
      "Design Essentials is trying to delay big price increases until 2026 or 2027, and may turn to layoffs or pause promotions to save money, said president Cornell McBride Jr. Most packaging plastics come from China, but ingredients can come from many places.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to put it to the consumer but the person who pays is the consumer in the end,\u201d McBride Jr. said.",
      "Hawa Keita and her mother usually charge customers between $160 and $250 for braiding at their shop, Eve\u2019s African Hair Braiding in College Park southwest of Atlanta. Keita is determined to take losses because their customers \u201ccan\u2019t afford the Atlanta prices,\u201d Keita said.",
      "The cost of a box of 100 packs of braiding hair from China went up for the first time in two years, from $250 to $300, Keita said. They order weekly, often multiple boxes. Some companies say they'll soon raise prices or run out of stock.",
      "Making customers happy is ultimately what will keep the business afloat, Keita said. She smiled as she recounted braiding a young woman\u2019s hair for her birthday with a style she suggested.",
      "\u201cWhen we finished, she gave me the biggest hug, and she was in here screaming and just yelling because she just really loved her hair,\u201d Keita said.",
      "For many Black Americans, especially women, affording their hair care also means confronting unfavorable beauty standards. Georgia State University law professor Tanya Washington said recent discoveries about dangerous chemicals in synthetic hair and hair straightening products have sparked conversations among Black women looking for hairstyles that don't require as much imported products.",
      "But embracing natural hairdos can be daunting for women like the soon-to-be lawyers and clerks Washington advises who face pressure to straighten their hair.",
      "\u201cThat puts everyone who does not have organically, naturally derived straight hair at a disadvantage in these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that a definition of professionalism that favors one phenotype \u2014 European phenotype \u2014 over all others, is inappropriate.\"",
      "Longstanding income disparities between Black and white American women can also make higher hair care prices untenable. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2023, the median household income in Atlanta is $131,319 for white households and $47,937 for Black households.",
      "It's an inequality issue that professional hairstylists are aware of nationwide.",
      "Stylist Mitzi Mitchell, owner of PIC ONE Beauty Services in Pennsylvania, said she has stocked up on certain products and tools for another year in anticipation of price increases.",
      "She wants to avoid \u201cbootleg\u201d products, which are made illegally and often aren\u2019t as safe, but became much more prevalent in the marketplace during economic downturns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really conscientious about my Black minority clients because we make a heck of a lot less than other nationalities,\u201d said Mitchell, who is Black. \u201cI try to keep prices low so we can continue to have the same services, but I know I will have to raise it.\u201d",

      "Nearly four dozen people in 18 states have been sickened in an expanding outbreak of salmonella food poisoning tied to recalled cucumbers sent to restaurants, hospitals, cruise ships and grocery stores, including Target stores, federal health officials said Friday.",
      "At least 16 people have been hospitalized after eating cucumbers produced by Florida-based Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The cucumbers were sold from April 29 through May 19.",
      "The outbreak includes reports of illness from people aboard six different cruise ships that departed from U.S. ports between late March and mid-April, the CDC said. The true number of sick people is likely much higher and the outbreak could affect additional states, officials said.",
      "Several companies have issued recalls for whole cucumbers and cucumbers used in a range of sandwiches, salsas and other foods linked to the outbreak. Target recalled dozens of products, including whole cucumbers, salads and vegetable rolls.",
      "The outbreak was detected during a follow-up inspection in April to a 2024 outbreak that sickened 551 people and led to 155 hospitalizations in 34 states and Washington, D.C.

      "Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has vetoed a bill that would have made Colorado the first state to ban landlords from using rent-setting algorithms, which many advocates have blamed for driving up housing costs across the country.",
      "RealPage is the target of a federal lawsuit filed last year that accuses the real estate software company of facilitating an illegal scheme to help landlords coordinate to hike rental prices. Eight other states, including Colorado, have joined the Department of Justice's lawsuit, though RealPage has vehemently denied any claims of collusion and has fought to have the lawsuit dismissed.",
      "Critics say RealPage software combines confidential information from each real estate management company in ways that enable landlords to align prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents. RealPage\u2019s clients include huge landlords who collectively oversee millions of units across the U.S.",
      "The Colorado bill, which recently passed the Democratic-led Legislature along party lines, would have prevented the use of such algorithms.",
      "In a veto letter Thursday, Polis said he understands the intent of the bill but that any collusion among landlords would already violate existing law.",
      "\u201cReducing market friction through legitimate means that do not entail collusion is good for both renters and landlords,\u201d Polis wrote. \u201cWe should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, RealPage applauded Polis' veto, calling it an example of \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Jennifer Bowcock, a spokesperson for the Texas-based firm.",
      "But Polis' decision outraged local housing advocates and the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer rights advocacy group that has helped lead the fight against RealPage and other companies that use rent-setting algorithms.",
      "\u201cThis veto sends the devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from people who have the least,\u201d said Sam Gilman, co-founder and president of the Community Economic Defense Project, a Colorado-based nonprofit.",
      "RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage's clients charge the highest possible rent.",
      "Although Colorado was the first state to pass a bill targeting rental algorithms, at least six cities have passed similar ordinances over the past year. They include Philadelphia; Minneapolis; San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "RealPage has decried those measures and sued over Berkeley's ordinance, saying it violates the company\u2019s free speech rights and is the result of an \u201cintentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\u201d about its products.",
      "RealPage argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply. It also says that its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since landlords are incentivized to maximize revenue and maintain high occupancy.",
      "A clause recently added to Republicans\u2019 signature \u201c big, beautiful \u201d tax bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. On Tuesday, five Democratic senators sent a letter to RealPage asking if the company was involved in getting that clause inserted.",
      "In an email, Bowcock said RealPage was not involved in the AI moratorium language, but she said the company supports \u201ca thoughtful, well-grounded, and consistent regulatory approach to AI, rather than a patchwork of state and local legislation.\u201d",

      "Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA on Friday; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.",

(Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they\u2019re trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a draft analysis of the environmental effects of building a protective tunnel around an aging Enbridge oil pipeline running beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes",
      "Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.",
      "The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.",
      "With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.",
      "Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.",
      "The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.",
      "Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.",
      "Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.",
      "The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.",
      "Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,\u201d Enbridge officials said in a statement.",
      "The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains \u201can existential threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cChances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes \u2014 our most valuable freshwater resource \u2014 skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.\u201d",
      "Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.",
      "\u201cMy key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,\" she said.",
      "Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.",
      "Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.",
      "Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.",
      "A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.",
      "About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\u2019s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it\u2019s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",

Aldi\u2019s chocolate sandwich cookies and Oreos both have blue packaging. The supermarket's Golden Round crackers and Mondelez\u2019s Ritz crackers are packaged in red boxes.",

      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",
      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump\u2019s tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "The \u201cagreement in principle\u201d will require the company to pay and invest more than $1.1 billion, including an additional $445 million for the crash victims\u2019 families, in return for dismissing the criminal case, according to court documents. Dismissing the fraud charge will allow the manufacturer to avoid a possible criminal conviction that could have jeopardized the company\u2019s status as a federal contractor, experts have said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, will decide whether to accept the motion to dismiss, accept the terms of the non-prosecution agreement and whether to cancel the trial. O\u2019Connor on Thursday ordered all the lawyers to present him with a briefing schedule on the government\u2019s motion by June 4.",

The Justice Department has noted that the victims\u2019 families had mixed views on the proposed deal.",

      "Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents dozens of the victims' families said in a statement Thursday that although he had wanted to see a more vigorous prosecution, he didn't think it was going to happen.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I can only hope the criminal case and the lawsuits motivated Boeing to improve safety,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really matters. We all want to walk onto a Boeing plane and feel safe.\u201d",
      "Boeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about a new software system that could turn the plane\u2019s nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.",
      "The Max planes crashed after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded until the company redesigned the software.",
      "The Justice Department charged Boeing in 2021 with deceiving FAA regulators about the software and about how much training pilots would need to fly the plane safely. The department agreed not to prosecute Boeing at the time, however, if the company paid a $2.5 billion settlement, including the $243.6 million fine, and took steps to comply with anti-fraud laws for three years.",
      "But last year, federal prosecutors said Boeing violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed last July to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring what could have been a lengthy public trial.",
      "Then in December, O'Connor rejected the plea deal. The judge said the diversity, inclusion and equity, or DEI, policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking a monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Under the new agreement, Boeing must retain an \u201cindependent compliance consultant\u201d who will make recommendations for \u201cfurther improvement\u201d and report back to the government, court documents said.",

      "Japan says China will resume imports of Japanese seafood that it banned in August 2023 over the discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea",
      "TOKYO -- China will resume Japanese seafood imports that it banned in 2023 over worries about Japan's discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, a Japanese official said Friday.",
      "The issue has been a significant political and diplomatic point of tension for the wary Asian powers.",
      "Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the two sides reached an agreement after Japanese and Chinese officials met in Beijing and the imports will resume once the necessary paperwork is done.",
      "China did not immediately comment. China blocked imports of Japanese seafood because it said the release would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities in eastern China.",
      "Japanese officials have said the wastewater must be released to make room for the nuclear plant\u2019s decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligible.",
      "Friday's announcement is based on an agreement between the two nations that Beijing would take steps toward ending the ban by joining water sampling missions by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The March 2011 nuclear meltdowns followed an earthquake and tsunami. There were meltdowns in the plant's three reactors, causing large amounts of radioactive water to accumulate. The water release has been a milestone for the plant\u2019s battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that officials say has hampered the daunting task of removing fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.",
      "The wastewater was treated and heavily diluted to reduce the radioactivity as much as possible before Japan began discharging the wastewater in August 2023.",
      "Last September, then-Prime Minster Fumio Kishida said the two sides reached \u201ca certain level of mutual understanding\u201d that China would start working toward easing the import ban and join the IAEA expanded monitoring of wastewater discharges.",
      "People inside and outside Japan protested the initial wastewater release. Japanese fishing groups said they feared it would further damage the reputation of their seafood. Groups in China and South Korea also raised concerns.",
      "Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings has said the utility would compensate Japanese business owners appropriately for damages suffered by export bans.",

      "Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, spoke for nearly two hours as she listed her accomplishments since taking office in January and announced multimillion-dollar investments to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s health, education and public safety.",

      "She noted that more than 60%, or roughly $8 billion, of the upcoming general fund budget is slated for health, education and public safety. The budget has not yet been approved.",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Santiago, vice president of Puerto Rico's Independence Party, said after the governor's address that the numbers announced are not sufficient given that thousands of certain government employees, including police officers, are needed.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, decried federal bureaucracy during her address, noting her administration would keep pushing to free some $18 billion in federal funds set aside to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid, which Hurricane Maria razed in September 2017 as a Category 4 storm.",
      "She also renewed her pledge to cancel the government\u2019s contract with Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cThe termination of this contract will be a reality,\u201d she said as supporters stood up and applauded.",

      "The length of her address and the speed at which she sometimes delivered it surprised some.",
      "Political analyst and university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto said it seemed like a ploy to distract those who have criticized her administration of inaction and the government of so far not approving many laws.",
      "\u201cShe tried to bring an optimistic tone because she knows she has received a lot of criticism,\" Schmidt Nieto said.",
      "Another who criticized Gonz\u00e1lez was Pablo Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and president of the opposition Popular Democratic Party: \u201cIf one word describes the start of this government, that word is disorder.\"",
      "He noted that in the past five months, Gonz\u00e1lez has presented three candidates for Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of state, two candidates for its justice department and another two candidates for its labor department. None of those positions have been filled as Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s party has failed so far to approve her nominees.",

      "CVS and Express Scripts are asking a federal judge to block an Arkansas law prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies in the state",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- CVS and Express Scripts asked a federal judge on Thursday to block a law prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies in Arkansas, challenging the first such restriction enacted by a state.",
      "The lawsuits come a little over a month after Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed the legislation restricting pharmacy benefit managers, also known as PBMs, which run prescription drug coverage for big clients that include health insurers and employers that provide coverage.",
      "Supporters of the Arkansas law have said it's needed because PBMs are forcing independent pharmacies, especially those in rural areas, to close.",
      "But in its lawsuit, Express Scripts said the measure would end up having \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d and force pharmacies around the state to close.",

      "CVS, which ran TV ads urging Sanders to veto the legislation, has said it would have to close its 23 retail pharmacies in the state if the law takes effect.",
      "Attorney General Tim Griffin defended the law on Thursday, saying PBMs' \u201cwield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk is leaving Washington after a short but turbulent stint in government and getting back to his numerous businesses, each with their own set of issues for the billionaire to address.",
      "Start with his electric car company Tesla. While how much Musk accomplished in his role as President Donald Trump's chief cost-cutter is up for debate, it's clear his association with right-wing politics damaged Tesla's brand and tanked sales.",
      "Musk's social media platform X, formerly Twitter, needs to rebuild its advertising base; his aerospace company SpaceX appears to be financially promising but has seen some recent setbacks; and it's unclear if his satellite business Starlink can keep striking deals without Trump nearby.",
      "Here's a look at the state of some key Musk businesses.",

      "The answer is crucial to reviving profits because so much else is uncertain. Tesla's lineup of cars in aging and its foreign rivals have become much more competitive. They would be taking market share from Tesla even in the best of circumstances.",
      "Tesla's decision to close down factories as it retooled its best-selling Model Y, among other temporary problems, contributed to its struggles in the first quarter. But the blowback from Musk's time in Washington created doubts for some analysts.",
      "In a note to clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\u201d And Wedbush Securities said at one point, \u201cThis is a full blown crisis.\"",
      "News earlier this week from Europe doesn't bode well: Sales in April plunged by half.",
      "Another big test for Musk: Will Tesla's launch of its first ever driverless taxis prove successful?",

      "Investors are convinced Musk will deliver, judging by the 50% jump in Tesla stock since he made that statement. But he faces many challenges, not least is whether technically the taxis will work without hitting things \u2014 or people.",
      "Federal safety regulators last month requested data from Telsa on how the robotaxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request comes after an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla last year equipped with Full Self-Driving software after several accidents, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",
      "Even if the Austin test goes off without a hitch, Musk faces another challenge: Waymo.",
      "The driverless taxi company owed by Google parent Alphabet just logged its ten-millionth trip and is now operating in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and several other cities.",
      "After Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and opened it up to all manner of conspiracy theories, long-time advertisers began to flee. Then Musk made the situation worse when he threatened to \u201cname and shame\u201d them, and sued them.",

      "\u201cSome big brands resumed spending on X in part to curry favor with the Trump administration, or to avoid potential retaliation by Musk,\u201d said e-marketer analyst Jasmine Enberg,. \u201cBut fear is not a sustainable motivator, and most were spending less than they were previously.\u201d",
      "She expects X\u2019s ad business will rebound this year, but still be smaller than it was before Musk bought the company.",
      "It's not clear how well Musk's rocket company SpaceX is faring because the private company doesn't disclose its finances. That said, news headlines point to both troubles and triumphs.",
      "First the bad development, which came just this week with a spinning explosion of one of the company's Starship mega rockets over the Indian Ocean. That followed explosions of two other Starships earlier this year that sprayed flaming debris across the Caribbean Ocean.",
      "Undeterred, Musk is vowing several more tests soon but the stakes are high and the clock is ticking. NASA hopes to use Starship for future missions to the moon, including one next year that will attempt a lunar orbit and then send the four astronauts aboard back home.",
      "The good news is that investors who have gotten a peek at SpaceX's finances apparently are excited.",
      "A private financing round for the company a few months ago followed by a private sale of shares recently have reportedly valued SpaceX at $350 billion, a big jump from a $210 billion estimated value just a year ago.",
      "A SpaceX satellite internet subsidiary called Starlink also has been striking deals to set up in foreign countries. But it's not clear how much is the result of cold business calculation and how much is due to politics, an advantage that could disappear as Musk leaves Washington.",

      "Next up: South Africa, maybe.",
      "Earlier this month, following Trump's Oval Office dressing down of that country's president, regulators in the country loosened a rule in a way that could help Starlink win a foothold in the country.

There was an umpire review that appeared to involve whether or not Grant touched home plate. After a nearly 15-minute delay, the home run ruling was upheld because it was determined on the field that the runs were scored, and the home plate umpire announced that the play was not reviewable.",
      "Tennessee coach Karen Weekly said Tennessee noticed that Grant's teammates touched her and helped her back to home plate. Weekly believed that was illegal, which would have turned Grant's homer into the third out, so the Volunteers notified the umpires.

      "\u201cIt was just kind of a blackout moment.\" she said. \u201cI know going into that bat I just wanted to keep my mind right, stay aggressive.

The tensions were high and everything, and that\u2019s just where I just laid my pressure on.\u201d",
      "Even after giving up the homer, Tennessee's Karlyn Pickens recovered and went the distance for the win. The first-team National Fastpitch Coaches Association All-American gave up four earned runs on 11 hits and struck out seven.",
      "\u201cWell, during that lengthy review/not review, we talked about if it comes back and it goes against us and we\u2019re tied up, then we keep playing,\" Weekly said. \u201cSo we just kept putting them in that mindset \u2014 I think prepare for the worst. And then if the best happens, great.\u201d",

      "Stark maintained her poise well enough to earn a $2.4 million prize in the most lucrative event of the year. Now she just needs to figure out how to spend her winnings.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has called himself for breaking the rules at the French Open and conceded a point during his four-set victory over Ben Shelton",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz called himself for breaking the rules at the French Open and conceded a point to Ben Shelton on Sunday during the defending champion's 7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory in the fourth round.",
      "Early in the second set, Shelton whipped a passing shot well out of Alcaraz's reach up at the net. So Alcaraz flung his racket \u2014 and, as his equipment flipped through the air, its strings somehow not only made contact with the ball but sent it back over the net and onto the other side of the court.",
      "Initially, the second-seeded Alcaraz was awarded the point. But he immediately went over to the chair umpire to admit that he wasn't holding his racket when it touched the ball. That's not allowed, so the point went to Shelton, an American seeded 13th.",
      "When the official informed the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd what had happened, Alcaraz was given a round of applause.",
      "This all happened at what could have been a critical moment, because instead of leading 40-30 on his serve, Alcaraz was now down 30-40, giving Shelton his first break point of the match. But Alcaraz saved that one \u2014 and five others in that 20-point game \u2014 along the way to taking a two-set lead in an entertaining matchup between a pair of 22-year-olds who hit the ball hard.",
      "The 13th-seeded Shelton, twice a semifinalist at majors, delivered serves at up to 143 mph (230 kph) and forehands at up to 116 mph (187 kph). Alcaraz, already a four-time Grand Slam champion, showed off various parts of his repertoire.",
      "It was tighter than the score might indicate: Shelton held three opportunities to own the opening set, leading in the tiebreaker at 6-4, 6-5 and 7-6. Take any of the subsequent points, and Shelton would own that set.",
      "But Alcaraz \u2014 who meets No. 12 Tommy Paul of the U.S. in the quarterfinals Tuesday \u2014 saved the first with a service winner. Shelton netted a backhand on the next. And the last ended with Shelton smacking a backhand right at the body of Alcaraz, who was up at the net and contorted himself in order to chop a drop volley winner.",
      "Alcaraz then converted his second set point, closing a 15-stroke exchange with a down-the-line forehand that drew a mistake from Shelton.",
      "The third set went to Shelton when Alcaraz put a forehand into the net, and the big-swinging American punched the air, then his chest, and screamed: \u201cLet's go, baby! Come on!\u201d",
      "The fourth swung Alcaraz\u2019s way when he used a drop shot winner to set up a break point that he claimed for a 2-1 edge and, after a total of 3 hours, 19 minutes, he was able to finish off an 11th consecutive win at Roland-Garros.",

      "Iga Swiatek turned things around at Roland-Garros after dropping eight of the first nine games against 12th-seeded Elena Rybakina in the fourth round and put together a 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory to extend her bid for a record fourth consecutive French Open...",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Iga Swiatek turned things around at Roland-Garros after dropping eight of the first nine games against 12th-seeded Elena Rybakina in the fourth round Sunday, putting together a 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory to extend her bid for a record fourth consecutive French Open championship.",
      "The big-serving and hard-hitting Rybakina \u2014 who won Wimbledon in 2022 \u2014 got off to a stunning start, leading 5-0 after less than 20 minutes and grabbing 24 of the initial 32 points. She was responsible for 10 of the match's first 12 winners.",
      "\u201cI needed to do something to get back in the match and, honestly, with her playing like that, I didn't have a lot of hope,\u201d Swiatek said afterward.",
      "There was more of the same early in the second set. Swiatek double-faulted to close the first game, then turned to her team in the stands with her palms up and said something; soon she was down 2-0.",
      "That, though, is when Swiatek suddenly transformed back into what she's been so often in recent seasons, but not over the past 12 months: a seemingly invincible force on red clay who has won four of the past five titles at the French Open, where she is 39-2 for her career and unbeaten in her past 25 contests.",
      "That certainly seemed in danger at the outset in Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Swiatek had trouble dealing with Rybakina's power and repeatedly was forced into errors. Given the rough stretch since June 2024 for Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, maybe it would not have been entirely shocking for her to take a loss Sunday.",
      "After all, Swiatek hasn\u2019t reached the final of any event since earning the trophy in Paris a year ago and has slid from No. 1 to No. 5 in the WTA rankings.",
      "That rut includes a surprising exit in the semifinals at the 2024 Summer Olympics, which were contested at Roland-Garros; she ended up with the bronze medal. Then, later last season, she was banned for a total of one month after testing positive for a banned substance; her explanation was accepted that the result was unintentional and caused by a contaminated medicine.",
      "On Tuesday, Swiatek will play No. 13 Elina Svitolina, a three-time major semifinalist but 0-4 in previous French Open quarterfinals.",
      "Svitolina saved three match points earlier Sunday to get past 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1. All of the top eight women\u2019s seeds reached the fourth round; No. 4 Paolini was the first to exit.",
      "Swiatek was almost the next, but she pulled out the tight win.",
      "One key moment across the 2 1/2 hours that perhaps presaged Rybakina\u2019s unraveling came when she was a point away from a second break in the second set and had the chance to strike a forehand into an empty section of the court. Instead, she hit it right at Swiatek. When the ball came back over the net, Rybakina netted a jumping overhead.",
      "Soon, Swiatek was playing better, imposing herself on groundstroke exchanges as she tends to, in part by moving closer to the baseline. Her returns became more effective as Rybakina\u2019s first-serve percentage dipped from 56% in the first set to 45% in the second and 43% in the third.",
      "In the second set, Swiatek reeled off five straight games and, in one burst, 10 straight points.",
      "Still, not all was smooth sailing in the third for Swiatek. Not at all.",
      "She faced three break points while trailing 3-2 but escaped from that predicament. After earning a break to lead 4-3, though, Swiatek gave it right back, double-faulting to allow Rybakina to make it 4-all.",
      "In the next game, Swiatek appeared to have a break for a 5-4 edge when, on break point, Rybakina's second serve was ruled a fault. But chair umpire Kader Nouni overruled the line judge\u2019s out call. When Swiatek told him Rybakina didn't argue about the original ruling, Nouni replied: \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to check it.\u201d",
      "It was one of several disputed calls in the third, and Rybakina eventually held there, and Swiatek held for 5-all, then claimed the last two games. When the match ended on her forehand winner, Swiatek yelled, rocked back on her heels and put her fist to her chest.",

      "Later Sunday, No. 13 Ben Shelton and No. 15 Frances Tiafoe played their fourth-round matches with a chance to join Paul in the quarterfinals. Shelton's opponent was defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, while Tiafoe faced Daniel Altmaier of Germany.",

      "Saturday's Champions League triumph confirmed what many observers had suspected for some time - that PSG's moment had finally come.",
      "Years of frustration in European club soccer's elite competition was blown away in one glorious and historic night in Munich.",
      "Not only did PSG end its long wait for the trophy it prized most of all but it produced a statement performance and set a new benchmark for what it is to win the Champions League title.",
      "The 5-0 rout of Inter Milan was officially the biggest winning margin of any final in the competition's 70-year history. And it could have been so much more emphatic had Bradley Barcola been clinical in front of goal, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia taken more than just one of his chances or D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 stayed on the field for longer than 67 minutes having scored two and set up another.",
      "Star striker Ousmane Dembele didn't even get a goal to his name.",
      "As impressive as PSG's victory was, it could have been even better. In other words, this is a team that is yet to reach its peak.",
      "With an average age of 24.8 years old, PSG's starting lineup was packed with youth, which was in stark contrast to an Inter team with an average age of over 30.",
      "At 31, captain Marquinhos was PSG's only starter over 30, while Dou\u00e9 was one of three teenagers to play, along with substitutes Senny Mayulu and Warren Zaire-Emery.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of young players - players who need to develop and I'm one of them,\u201d Dou\u00e9 said. \u201cWe are always going to strive to get better.\u201d",
      "Keeping young teams together is easier said than done when Europe's biggest clubs come calling. That should not be a concern for Qatar-backed PSG, which is one of the richest clubs in the world and in recent years has focused on picking up the best young talent - from France in particular.",
      "It seems there is little danger of PSG settling for just one Champions League title.",
      "\"We are ambitious, we are going to continue to conquer the football world,\u201d a triumphant Luis Enrique said Saturday night after winning the trophy for the second time as a coach, 10 years after leading Barcelona to the trophy.",

      "\u201cI think it is an incredible competition. Maybe not now in its first edition, but it will become an incredibly important competition to win,\u201d he said of the tournament that kicks off in the United States this month. \u201cWe want to finish the season in style with the cherry on the cake.\u201d",
      "The 55-year-old Luis Enrique has established himself as one of the finest coaches in the world after winning a second Champions League title.",
      "PSG has entrusted him to build a team in his image, rather than a selection of superstars and it has paid off.",

      "Liverpool, which ran away with the Premier League title this season, was eliminated in the round of 16, while Manchester City and Arsenal were beaten as well.",
      "Luis Enrique's brand of soccer has simply been too good for the rest in Europe, which is now playing catch up.",
      "It is difficult to see where PSG needs to add to a squad with so much depth, but its rise to the top has come on the back of spending billions on some of the world's best players.",
      "The era of Galactico signings is over for now, but the arrival of Kvaratskhelia from Napoli in January was evidence of president Nasser Al-Khelaifi's ongoing willingness to go big in the transfer market.",
      "The Georgian forward sparked a dramatic turnaround in PSG's form in Europe, which saw it go from near elimination at the league phase to Champions League winner.",
      "Manchester City might have thought its Champions League title in 2023 would spark a new era of success in Europe, but the opposite has been true and Pep Guardiola's team was eliminated in the playoffs this season.",
      "The Champions League is notoriously difficult to defend, with Real Madrid the only team to retain the trophy in the modern era, having won three in a row from 2016-18. The difficulty is largely due to the wide spread of talent among Europe's elite.",
      "PSG will come up against a Liverpool team that topped the league phase of this year's competition and is already making ambitious moves in the transfer market.",
      "Madrid with a new coach in Xabi Alonso and signings such as Trent Alexander-Arnold should be a contender again. So too Barcelona after falling short in the semifinal.",
      "City, meanwhile, is undergoing a rebuild of its own.",
      "PSG, however, will likely start next season as the team to beat, with a bright young squad that finally knows how to get over the line.",

      "The helicopter's advanced avionics, which Airbus codeveloped with Israeli companies in the last two years, also includes an integrated weapons system dubbed H-Force which enables the pilot to easily operate the helicopters weaponry in flight, eliminating the need for a separate weapons officer on board.",
      "Dudek said another unique aspect of the Cypriot helicopters is an integrated battle management system that enables the aircraft to operate seamlessly with forces on the ground as well as other aircraft, including those belonging to the forces of other nations.",
      "Additionally, the helicopter\u2019s electronic warfare and other systems afford it a strong self-protection capability.",
      "Ethnically-divided Cyprus is in the process of modernizing its defensive capabilities to bring it up to modern European and NATO standards after years of relying on mainly Soviet-era, Russian-made weaponry. The island nation continues to operate Russian-made T-80 main battle tanks, but has recently sold off 11 Russian-made Mi35 attack helicopters to Serbia.",
      "Cyprus was split in 1974, when Turkey invaded following a coup by Athens junta-backed supporters of uniting the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence and maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s northern third.",
      "The Cypriot defense minister said the helicopter purchase is part of wider strategic planning for the continuous upgrading of the National Guard, enabling the island to take part in joint military drills with friendly nations.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

    "story": [
      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",

      "Vance also touted the Trump administration\u2019s record at fulfilling the campaign promises made last year.",
      "As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",
      "The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Senate advanced legislation earlier this month that creates a federal framework to regulate stablecoins, a bill that Vance said the Trump administration wants passed into law quickly.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have identified a new pod of ancient hunter-gatherers who lived near the land bridge between North America and South America about 6,000 years ago.",
      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",
      "Discovered through ancient DNA, the group lived in the high plateaus of present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \u2014 close to where the Americas meet. Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",

      "Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our Milky Way galaxy",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\u201cWhile our discovery doesn\u2019t yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEither we are uncovering something entirely new, or we\u2019re seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d",
      "Launched in 1999, Chandra orbits tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth, observing some of the hottest, high-energy objects in the universe.",

      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Fukushima disaster resulted in large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the plant, polluting surrounding areas.",

      "The government is aiming to find disposal sites for the soil by 2045, with officials suggesting low risk material could be used to build roads and in other public works projects across the country.",
      "The Environment Ministry said that the soil will be used as foundation material and safely covered with top soil thick enough to keep radiation at negligible levels.",
      "But there is much public unease. The government has already been forced to discontinue a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",
      "The IAEA is providing assistance with the Fukushima decommissioning process, which requires removing more than 880 tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "In 2023 Japan began discharging treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the sea to reduce the risk of accidental leaks and to make space to build facilities needed for melted fuel removal.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone.",
      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",
      "Scientists think that ancient humans were crafting whale bone instruments in places including the Arctic and South Pacific. There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Delegations from Russia and Ukraine gathered in Turkey on Monday for their second round of direct peace talks in just over two weeks, although expectations were low for any significant progress on ending the three-year war.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation led Defense Minister Rustem Umerov was in Istanbul for the meeting, according to Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, said in a message posted on the Ukrainian Embassy Whatsapp group. The Russian delegation headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, arrived Sunday evening, Russian state media reported.",
      "Turkish officials said the meeting would start at 1 p.m. local time, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan presiding over the talks and officials from the Turkish intelligence agency also present.",
      "However, Ukrainian spokesperson Tykhyi said the start would be at midday local time. It was not immediately possible to clarify the discrepancy.",
      "Recent comments by senior officials in both countries indicate they remain far apart on the key conditions for stopping the war. Fierce fighting has in the meantime continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, and both sides have hit each other\u2019s territory with deep strikes.",
      "On Sunday, a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep inside Russia, Ukraine\u2019s Security Service said, while Moscow pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones.",

      "Ukrainian air defenses damaged 52 out of 80 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.",

      "The defense secretary warned Chinese action against Taiwan could be imminent.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reaffirmed in a speech in Singapore on Saturday that the United States will continue to support U.S allies in the Indo-Pacific region against Chinese aggression as he warned that Chinese military action against Taiwan could be \"imminent.\"",
      "Hegseth made his remarks in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which is organized by the International Institute for Security Studies and is a high-profile gathering of regional and international security leaders.",
      "His remarks laid out how the Trump administration sees the Indo-Pacific region as a \"priority theater\" and how the U.S. is prepared to stand by allies in a region where China continues to carry out aggressive military actions, particularly against Taiwan and the Philippines.",
      "\"We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not instigate nor seek to subjugate or humiliate,\" Hegseth said. \"President Trump and the American people have immense respect for the Chinese people and their civilization, but we will not be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not let our allies and partners be subordinated and intimidated.\"",
      "In recent years China has invested heavily in building up its military and increased its naval and air presence around Taiwan, engaging in almost daily harassment of Taiwan's borders -- raising concerns that it is preparing to retake by force the island nation it considers a breakaway province.",
      "\"Nobody knows what China will ultimately do,\" said Hegseth. \"But they are preparing and we must, therefore, be ready as well. Urgency and vigilance is our only option.\"",
      "\"We are preparing for war, to deter war \u2014 to achieve peace through strength,\" Hegseth added. \"And we look to you \u2014 our allies and partners \u2014 to join us in this important work. Our time is now. The threats we face will not wait. Nor can we.\"",
      "\"To be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world,\" said Hegseth who stressed that China may be ready to act sooner than the 2027 deadline that China's President Xi Jinping had set for China's military to be prepared for possible action against Taiwan.",
      "\"There is no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent -- we hope not, but it certainly could be,\" said Hegseth.",
      "China has also increased tensions with the Philippines where Chinese military vessels regularly harass Philippine ships operating in the international waters of the South China Sea as it continues to assert its territorial claims in the region.",
      "Relations between the U.S. and China have also soured following Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Chinese imports that led China to announce reciprocal tariffs. Both sides have since entered into a shaky temporary agreement to lower their tariffs.",
      "In his remarks, Hegseth said the Trump administration was pursuing a \"common sense\" approach to reestablishing deterrence that includes increasing the U.S. military presence in the western Pacific, \"helping allies and partners strengthen their defense capabilities, and by rebuilding our defense industrial bases.\"",

      "Hegseth encouraged Asian countries to follow the example of NATO nations that have made commitments to increase their military spending to 5% of their gross domestic product as the Trump administration has stated that it wants them to take more ownership of their security commitments in Europe.",
      "\"President Trump and I will be counting on you in this room -- our allies and partners -- to be force multipliers of peace alongside the United States,\" Hegseth said. \"We ask \u2014 and indeed, we insist \u2014 that our allies and partners do their part on defense.\"",
      "He added, \"Sometimes, this means having uncomfortable and tough conversations. Partners owe to it to each other to be honest and realistic. This is the essence of a pragmatic, common-sense foreign policy.\"",
      "Hegseth emphasized that the administration's approach does not mean that America's allies will have to go it alone in potential military actions.",
      "\"You will also see that we are -- and will remain -- loyal to our allies and partners. In fact, the only way to ensure lasting alliances and partnerships is to make sure each side does its part,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth added, \"We will stand with you and beside you to deter Chinese aggression,\" said Hegseth.",
      "The forum is sometimes an opportunity for high-level meetings between top U.S. and Chinese defense leaders during times of rising tension. But in an apparent snub, China's defense minister did not attend this year's forum and instead China was represented by a delegation from its National Defense University.",
      "\"We can't account for whether or not China is here or not, but we're glad we are, and we think it makes the region more stable and more peaceful,\" Hegseth told reporters when asked to comment on China's decision.",
      "China's rising aggression in the region has been a major topic of the conference that included an opening address by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been touring of Southeast Asian nations to stress France's role in the region.",
      "On Friday night, Hegseth sat in the audience as Macron stressed the importance of a new alliance between European and Asian nations to avoid becoming \"collateral victims of decisions made by superpowers\" -- a reference to the United States and China.",
      "Macron cautioned against a loss of credibility for the international-rules based order if it is applied differently by the U.S. with regard to China while it attempts to resolve the war in Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep seized Ukrainian territory as the Trump administration has proposed.",
      "\"If we consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what could happen in Taiwan?\" Macron said. \"What would you do the day something happens in the Philippines?\"",
      "\"What is at stake in Ukraine is our common credibility, that we are still able to preserve territorial integrity and sovereignty of people,\" said Macron. \"No double standards.\"",

      "Both governors have denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination.",
      "Democratic governors Tim Walz and Wes Moore are fired up - but not solely to eat South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's so-called \"world famous\" breaded fish.",
      "They're fired up to refocus their party, and on Friday evening, both pitched their theory of how to build up coalitions and win back the Americans they've lost: emphasize the political gravity of the moment forcefully and frequently, and don't wait until the midterms to talk to as many constituencies as possible.",
      "\"Each and every one of us, we're not going to have someone come save us. But who wants that? We can save ourselves. We can get out there. We can make a difference,\" said Minnesota Gov. Walz during brief remarks on stage to a few hundred Democrats in Columbia, South Carolina. \"We need to change the attitude, compete in every district, compete for every school board seat, and come out to this damn fish fry with the attitude: 'we're going to fill up on some fish, and then we are going to beat the hell out of these dictators.'\"",
      "Moore, the first Black governor of Maryland, in his remarks stressed that the \"baton is in our hands.\"",
      "\"We are not going to drop it. We are going to run through the tape, and we are going to win because we understand what's at stake,\" said Moore",
      "He continued the refrain, as a rallying cry of sorts: \"Send a message the entire country is going to hear. This is our time. This is our moment. We will not shirk, we will not flinch, we will not blink. We will win, just as those who came before us did.\"",
      "Yet, neither of them said that they should be the leader of the party in 2028. Both governors have denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination, which the pair reiterated during a gaggle with reporters before their on-stage remarks Friday. During that gaggle, Clyburn said he saw both Walz and Moore as \"great leaders\" but said they have to decide their own plans.",
      "Walz has said he has no plans for a White House run and is still mulling whether he will run for gubernatorial reelection. When pressed at an appearance at Harvard's Institute of Politics, Walz said he wasn't sure if the party's eventual candidate is clear just yet.",
      "\"I think it's a super talented bench,\" Walz said. \"Do I think the person's out there? No, I'm not sure they're out there yet.\"",
      "Moore has rejected the notion more fiercely, telling ABC's \"The View\" plainly, \"I am not running.\"",
      "He doubled down in the reporter gaggle Friday, \"Anyone who is talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously,\" Moore told reporters. \"The fight is 2025. Right now.\"",
      "Moore also gave a keynote address at the state's key fundraiser, the Blue Palmetto Dinner, just before his Fish Fry appearance, where, according to a circulated copy ahead of his remarks, he said the party must be delivering \"an alternative\" to Trump at this moment.",
      "\"I want to be clear: We can \u2013 and we must \u2013 condemn Donald Trump's reckless actions. But we would also be foolish not to learn from his impatience. Now is the time for us to be impatient too. Let's not just talk about an alternative. Let's not just study an alternative. Let's deliver an alternative,\" Moore's prepared remarks said.",
      "Even still, it's no secret that Clyburn's fish fry has often been fertile waters for would-be Democratic rising stars and Pennsylvania Ave. hopefuls to mix and mingle among powerful party operatives, donors, and key South Carolina early state voters in one night. And while not as much of a crazed scene as the 2019 event, where a menagerie of Dem candidates vied for stage-time as the partiers shimmied shoulder to shoulder, Friday night's event was still high-energy.",
      "Walz will be speaking to Palmetto State Democrats once again Saturday morning. But that doesn't end the Minnesota governor's campaign travel. After his address on Saturday, he's quickly off to California to speak at its Democratic Party's event.",
      "The famous fish fete tees off a weekend of fundraising and party business as the South Carolina Democratic Party convenes for their state convention. Friday night's event also comes as South Carolina's future placement within the party's early voting calendar is in flux.",
      "Last cycle, due to changes made by the Democratic National Committee, South Carolina replaced historically first Iowa as the initial contest. However, Democrats must set a new calendar for 2028.",
      "Which order the state comes in is less important to Clyburn, he said.",
      "\"I never ask for anything more than to keep us in the pre-primary window,\" said Clyburn. \"Whether that be one, two, three, or four, I don't care.\"",

      "He spoke to reporters after a veterans memorial event in Delaware.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, after delivering first public remarks since his office announced earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with 'aggressive\" prostate cancer, told reporters on Friday that he was feeling \"optimistic\" about his prognosis.",
      "\"Well, the prognosis is good. You know, we're working on everything. It's moving along. So, I feel good,\" Biden said.",
      "He said he had decided on a treatment option, mentioning that he would be taking various medications.",
      "\"The expectation is, we're going to be able to beat this \u2026 it's not in any organ. My bones are strong. It hasn't penetrated so I'm feeling good,\" he added, later saying his family is also optimistic about the diagnosis and said \"one of the leading surgeons in the world\" is working with him.",
      "The announcement from Biden's office said there was \"metastasis to the bone.\"",
      "Asked about the recent controversy over his mental and physical capabilities while in office, Biden joked, with a smile, \"You can see that -- I'm mentally incompetent and I can't walk.\"",
      "And asked about Democrats who say he shouldn't have run again, Biden said, \"Why didn't they run against me then? Because I'd have beaten them.\" He added he has no regrets.",
      "\"There's a lot going on. And I think we're in a really difficult moment, not only in American history, in world history. I think we're one of those inflection points in history where the decisions we make in the next little bit are going to determine what things look like for the next 20 years,\" he added, saying he is proud of his record as president.",
      "On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that former first lady Jill Biden should \"speak up about what she saw in regards to her husband and when she saw it and what she knew,\" accusing her of lying.",
      "Asked about Leavitt's comments, Biden smiled and said, \"I don't know who the press secretary is,\" but afterward said he was joking and that the media would play that straightforwardly.",
      "In his earlier formal remarks at a Memorial Day service in his home state of Delaware, Biden said that American politics have \"become so divided and so bitter,\" but that he sees the military as united.",
      "\"My friends, Memorial Day is about something profound,\" Biden said. \"Our politics have become so divided and so bitter -- all the years that I've been doing this, I never thought we'd get to this point, but we are. Our troops don't wear a uniform that says I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican; it says I'm an American, I'm an American, that's who I am.\"",
      "Biden also called his time as the commander in chief the greatest honor of his life, and highlighted the 10th anniversary of the passing of his son Beau \u2013 who served in the Delaware Army National Guard and died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015, when he was 46 years old.",
      "\"The greatest honor [of] my life has been, for four years, of being the commander in chief, [of the] United States,\" Biden said, adding a lighthearted aside that if he had come from another state besides Delaware, he doesn't think that would have happened.",
      "\"I know for many of you, Memorial Day, like for us, is deeply personal,\" Biden said solemnly later in his remarks. \"For the Bidens, this day is the 10th anniversary [of] the loss of my son Beau, [who] spent a year in Iraq, and to be honest, it's a hard day.\"",
      "He spoke about Beau joining him at Memorial Day services, about Beau's time in the Delaware Army National Guard and deployment to Iraq, and the time Beau asked his father to pin the bars on his military uniform.",
      "Beau's legacy lives on in his children and grandchildren, like the legacies of the loved ones other attendees lost, Biden said. \"And just like the legacy of all our fallen heroes lives on -- they live on in us, and they live on in the strength and freedom of our nation. That sounds like hyperbole, but it's real. It's literal.\"",
      "\"So everyone, everyone who came here today to grieve with grief in your heart, please know you're not alone. You'll never be alone, and your loved one will never be forgotten. Period,\" Biden said.",
      "He told attendees as well that \"being with all of you, quite frankly, it makes things a little bit easier. It really does. So thank you for allowing me to grieve with you.\"",
      "After his remarks, Biden appeared visibly emotional when other elected officials speaking at the event spoke about Beau Biden, praising who he was and his military service.",
      "Speaking more generally about Memorial Day, Biden told attendees, \"Folks, every year we come together to remember, to remember, to remember the brave women and men who gave their all for this nation, or as Lincoln called it, the last full measure of devotion,\" Biden said.",
      "He added, \"They laid down their lives so we could live our lives in peace, and maybe the most important word with possibilities. And I know, I know I speak for everyone here, and \u2014 when I say, we remember them every single day, not just this day, but every day.\"",
      "The former president spoke forcefully about providing services to veterans, saying that those who served and have passed deserve that honor.",
      "\"So today, let's renew our pledge to honor our heroes. I mean, sincerely renew our pledge to honor our heroes... I get really angry when I hear about, [claims that] veterans are seeking too much. They're not enough!\" Biden said, adding that is why he wrote legislation relating to Gold Star families and others.",
      "Biden's remarks were also his first after the release of the the book \"Original Sin\", written by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which alleges Biden had physical and mental impairments while president that were covered up by people in his inner circle.",
      "Spokespeople for Biden have said nothing in \"Original Sin\" shows that Biden did not do his job or that there was any cover-up. Biden. In an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" earlier this month, Biden pushed back on a slate of books making claims about his mental acuity, with the former president saying, \"They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that.\"",

      "Trump held a rally at U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh Friday.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday touted a \"blockbuster agreement\" between U.S. Steel and Japanese company Nippon Steel that he said would keep the iconic U.S. steelmaker in Pittsburgh -- though he previously opposed such a merger and offered few details on the specifics of the deal.",
      "Trump discussed the \"partnership\" between the two companies during a rally at the Irvin Works plant in Allegheny County on Friday evening -- flanked by steelworkers and big banners reading \"American Jobs\" and \"The Golden Age.\" During the event, Trump also announced his plan to double a current 25% tariff on steel imports to 50%.",
      "Trump told the crowd Nippon would invest a total of $14 billion as part of the deal, with some $2.2 billion slotted to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley and another $7 billion to modernize steel mills, expand ore mines and build facilities in Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama and Arkansas.",
      "Trump emphasized that the U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, bringing in more jobs for Americans -- and even promised a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. Steel worker.",
      "\"There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever,\" Trump pledged.",
      "U.S. Steel would still be \"controlled by the USA,\" Trump said, adding, \"Otherwise, I wouldn't have done the deal.\" But he did not explicitly say how the ownership of the company would be structured.",
      "Despite hailing the agreement during the rally, Trump later told reporters that he hasn't seen the final details yet.",
      "\"I have to approve the final deal with Nippon and we haven't seen that final deal yet,\" Trump told reporters on the tarmac following the Pittsburgh event. \"But they've made a very big commitment, and it's a very big investment.\"",
      "In his remarks at the rally, the president said U.S. Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years.",
      "\"You're not going to have to worry about that,\" he said, predicting, \"They're going to be here a lot longer than that.\"",
      "In his remarks at the rally, Trump portrayed himself as a skillful dealmaker, saying he rejected previous offers from Nippon before he said he realized they how much they wanted to invest in the U.S.",
      "\"I have to tell you about Nippon,\" Trump said. \"They kept asking me over and I kept rejecting it. 'No way, no way, no way.' And after about four times, I said, 'You know, these people really want to do a great thing. They ... really want it.\"",
      "Trump once opposed sale",
      "Trump first announced the agreement on his conservative social media platform last week. He said it would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the American economy. The \"investment,\" he wrote, would take place over the next 14 months.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Trump pledged to block the Japanese steelmaker from purchasing U.S. Steel. As president-elect, he repeated that vow.",
      "\"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,\" Trump wrote in a post to his conservative social media platform in early December.",
      "The Biden administration in January blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel over national security concerns. The White House said at the time it was important to keep one of the largest steel producers in the nation an American-owned company.",
      "The reaction was mixed. The president of the United Steelworkers union, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers, celebrated the move while local leaders expressed concern about U.S. Steel's future in southwestern Pennsylvania.",
      "Weeks after the inauguration, Trump met with U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt at the White House. In early April, he ordered a new national security review of Nippon Steel's proposed bid to acquire U.S. Steel.",
      "Leading up to Friday's rally, the White House had provided few details, other than those mentioned by Trump in his social media post, about the agreement.",
      "Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser, insisted on Thursday that U.S. Steel \"owns\" the company.",
      "\"Nippon Steel is going to have some involvement but no control of the company,\" Navarro told reporters outside the White House, though he didn't take any more questions on the agreement.",
      "Nippon was seeking 100% ownership of U.S. Steel in talks with Trump, Nikkei Asia reported earlier this month.",
      "U.S. Steel issued a brief statement last week in which it said Trump \"is a bold leader and businessman who knows how to get the best deal for America.\"",
      "\"U. S. Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,\" the company said without sharing more specifics.",

      "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein says he doesn't plan to testify in his New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein doesn't plan to testify at his New York sex crimes retrial, his lawyer said Sunday. That means jurors soon will get the case against the former movie studio boss who propelled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.",
      "The trial will move on to closing arguments Tuesday without testimony from Weinstein, Arthur Aidala said Sunday night. The court handles other cases on Mondays.",
      "It's unclear whether jury deliberations would begin Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.",
      "It was a fraught decision for Weinstein, who didn\u2019t testify at previous trials in New York and California and was convicted in both. He denies the allegations, and Aidala has said that Weinstein was carefully weighing whether to take the stand this time.",
      "While his California appeal winds on, Weinstein won a new trial in his New York rape and sexual assault case when the state\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction.",
      "He's charged in New York with raping Jessica Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, separately, in 2006. Mann was an actor and hairstylist, Haley a production assistant and producer, and Sokola a model who aspired to an acting career.",
      "All three women testified for days at the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of what they say they endured. They said Weinstein suggested he'd help them achieve their show-business dreams, but then maneuvered them into private settings and preyed on them.",
      "His attorneys have argued that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "In the U.S., defendants in criminal cases aren't obligated to testify, and many decide not to, for various reasons. Among them: the prospect of being questioned by prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein has been watching the New York retrial intently from the defense table, sometimes shaking his head at accusers\u2019 testimony and often leaning over to one or another of his attorneys to convey his thoughts.",
      "Aidala said outside court Thursday that Weinstein thought a lot of holes had been poked in the accusers' accounts, but that he also was pondering whether jurors would feel they needed to hear from him.",
      "The jury has heard from a few other defense witnesses \u2014 one of them via a transcript read by court employees.",
      "That witness, Talita Maia, testified at the 2020 trial but was unavailable this time, so jurors instead got a reading Friday of her earlier testimony. One court stenographer voiced the 2020 attorneys' questions, while another stenographer sat in the witness box and rendered Maia's answers, at times with emphasis.",
      "Maia and Mann were roommates and friends in 2013 but later fell out. According to Maia, Mann never mentioned in those days that Weinstein had hurt her in any way. Both Maia and another witness, Thomas Richards, met up with Mann and Weinstein shortly after Mann has said she was raped.",
      "Both witnesses testified that they saw nothing amiss.",
      "Mann testified earlier this month that she never anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn't think she'd be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.",
      "Weinstein's defense also brought in former Sokola pal Helga Samuelsen, who has friendly ties to the former producer. Samuelsen testified Thursday that Weinstein visited Sokola once and spent about a half-hour in a bedroom with her in a New York apartment the women briefly shared in 2005; Sokola told jurors no such thing happened.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola, Mann and Haley have given their permission to be identified.",

      "A list of more than 500 \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s website after receiving criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies",
      "WASHINGTON -- A widely anticipated list of \u201c sanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears on the Department of Homeland Security's website after receiving widespread criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.",
      "The department last week published the list of the jurisdictions. It said each one would receive formal notification the government deemed them uncooperative with federal immigration enforcement and whether they\u2019re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.",
      "The list was published Thursday on the department\u2019s website but on Sunday there was a \u201cPage Not Found\" error message in its place.",
      "The list was part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to target communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren\u2019t doing enough to help its immigration enforcement agenda and the promises the president made to deport more than 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal authorization.",
      "The list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly, a DHS senior official said.",
      "\u201cDesignation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\u201d the official said in a statement.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that there had been anger from some officials about the list. However, she didn\u2019t address why it was removed.",
      "\u201cSome of the cities have pushed back,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThey think because they don\u2019t have one law or another on the books that they don\u2019t qualify, but they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals.\u201d",
      "The list, which was riddled with misspellings, received pushback from officials in communities spanning from urban to rural and blue to red who said the list doesn\u2019t appear to make sense.",
      "In California, the city of Huntington Beach made the list even though it had filed a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s immigration sanctuary law and passed a resolution this year declaring the community a \u201cnon-sanctuary city.\u201d",
      "Jim Davel, administrator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, said the inclusion of his community must have been a clerical error. Davel voted for Trump as did 67% of Shawano County.",
      "Davel thinks the administration may have confused the county\u2019s vote in 2021 to become a \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary County\u201d that prohibits gun control measures with it being a safe haven for immigrants. He said the county has approved no immigration sanctuary policies.",

      "Tulsa\u2019s new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help",
      "TULSA, Okla. -- Tulsa's new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help in a city-backed bid to make amends for one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.",
      "The plan by Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black mayor of Oklahoma's second-largest city, would not provide direct cash payments to descendants or the last two centenarian survivors of the attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. He made the announcement at the Greenwood Cultural Center, located in the once-thriving district of North Tulsa that was destroyed by a white mob.",
      "Nichols said he does not use the term reparations, which he calls politically charged, characterizing his sweeping plan instead as a \u201croad to repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor 104 years, the Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city's history,\u201d Nichols said Sunday after receiving a standing ovation from several hundred people. \u201cThe massacre was hidden from history books, only to be followed by the intentional acts of redlining, a highway built to choke off economic vitality and the perpetual underinvestment of local, state and federal governments.",
      "\u201cNow it's time to take the next big steps to restore.\u201d",
      "Nichols said the proposal wouldn't require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely.",
      "The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105 million in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by June 1, 2026. Although details would be developed over the next year by an executive director and a board of managers, the plan calls for the bulk of the funding, $60 million, to go toward improving buildings and revitalizing the city's north side.",
      "\u201cThe Greenwood District at its height was a center of commerce,\u201d Nichols said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo what was lost was not just something from North Tulsa or the Black community. It actually robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivaled anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Nichols' proposal follows an executive order he signed earlier this year recognizing June 1 as Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day, an official city holiday. Events Sunday in the Greenwood District included a picnic for families, worship services and an evening candlelight vigil.",
      "Nichols also realizes the current national political climate, particularly President Trump's sweeping assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, poses challenging political crosswinds.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this lines up with a broader national conversation is a tough environment,\u201d Nichols admitted, \u201cbut it doesn't change the work we have to do.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Weary, is a granddaughter of massacre survivor John R. Emerson, Sr., who owned a hotel and cab company in Greenwood that were destroyed. She acknowledged the political difficulty of giving cash payments to descendants. But at the same time, she wondered how much of her family's wealth was lost in the violence.",
      "\u201cIf Greenwood was still there, my grandfather would still have his hotel,\u201d said Weary, 65. \u201cIt rightfully was our inheritance, and it was literally taken away.\u201d",
      "Tulsa is not the first U.S. city to explore reparations. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, was the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination, offering qualifying households $25,000 for home repairs, down payments on property, and interest or late penalties on property in the city. The funding for the program came from taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana.",
      "Other communities and organizations that have considered providing reparations range from the state of California to cities including Amherst, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Asheville, North Carolina; and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.",
      "In Tulsa, there are only two living survivors of the Race Massacre, both of whom are 110 years old: Leslie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher. The women, both of whom were in attendance on Sunday, received direct financial compensation from both a Tulsa-based nonprofit and a New York-based philanthropic organization, but have not received any recompense from the city or state.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the survivors and the founder of the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, said earlier this year that any reparations plan should include direct payments to Randle and Fletcher and a victims' compensation fund for outstanding claims.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Solomon-Simmons on behalf of the survivors was rejected by the Oklahoma Supreme Court last year, dampening racial justice advocates' hopes that the city would ever make financial amends.",

      "The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted \u201cto debunk some false claims\" about his tax cuts.",
      "Leavitt said that the \"blatantly wrong claim that the \u2018One, Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\u201d",
      "But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.",
      "\u201cWe have to get a lot of votes,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t be cutting.\u201d",
      "That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable.",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: \u201cI was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",
      "To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.",
      "But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.",
      "The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.",
      "The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.",
      "Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when that growth is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods \u2014 all of which, by Miran\u2019s logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cI do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,\u201d Miran told reporters recently.",
      "White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is \u201cin any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.\u201d",
      "Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.",
      "\u201cThis just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,\u201d said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be \u201cdealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.\u201d",
      "Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are \u201ca work of fiction.\u201d He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,\u201d said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. \u201cThese are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.\u201d",
      "The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Johnson saying there are enough senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.",
      "\u201cI think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about the spending reduction and reducing the deficit,\u201d Johnson said on CNN.",
      "The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.",
      "When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it\u2019ll all happen very quickly,\u201d Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.",
      "Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional \u201cgrowth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.\u201d",
      "The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.",
      "\u201cIt's treading water,\u201d Tedeschi said.",

      "The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years.",
      "The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.",
      "Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.",
      "The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday \u2014 near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage \u2014 and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",
      "While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that \u201crecognizes Alaska's unique value.\u201d",
      "Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline \u2014 despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.",
      "In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make \u201cenergy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,\" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.",
      "\u201cI think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.",
      "There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.",
      "Debate over drilling in the refuge \u2014 home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife \u2014 has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich\u2019in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.",
      "Many North Slope I\u00f1upiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.",
      "Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d",
      "For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.",
      "The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the \u201cgigantic natural gas pipeline.\" He said countries like Japan and South Korea \u201cwant to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.\u201d No firm commitments from countries have been made.",
      "The company advancing the project \u2014 in partnership with a state corporation \u2014 is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.",
      "While Dunleavy has likened Trump\u2019s friendly approach to energy development as \u201cChristmas every day,\u201d Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.",
      "State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",
      "Alaska\u2019s tax structure allows companies like ConocoPhillips Alaska \u2014 which is pursuing a massive oil project known as Willow in the reserve \u2014 to write off a portion of their development costs against production taxes they incur elsewhere on the North Slope. While lawmakers widely support Willow, they also have argued a change in federal royalty share would address a hit to state revenues created by production in the reserve.",

      "Pride Month kicks off with events around the world starting this weekend.",
      "It's an annual series of parades and other gatherings to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights.",
      "At its heart, Pride is both a party and a protest.",
      "In the U.S. this year, that means speaking out against a slew of policies that impose restrictions on transgender people and that try to end diversity, equity and inclusion programming in government, education and businesses.",
      "Here's a look at the event's roots and this year's events and themes.",
      "The monthlong global celebration began with Gay Pride Week in late June 1970, a year after the violent police raid at New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn, a gay bar.",
      "At a time when many LGBTQ+ people kept their identities private, the June 28, 1969, raid sparked a series of public protests and catalyzed the gay rights movement.",
      "The first pride week featured marches in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, and it has since grown to other cities. On the calendar are events in Philadelphia this weekend; New Orleans on June 14; Chicago on June 21 and 22; and New York over the weekend of June 28 and 29. Many other events in big cities and small towns are also planned.",
      "There are pride celebrations around the world, including in Tokyo on June 8; Toronto on June 27-29; Sao Paolo on June 22; and Paris on June 28.",
      "Some events fall outside of June, too. World Pride, a biannual event held this year in Washington, D.C., began in May and goes through June 8. Pride in London is in July; a big celebration in Rio de Janeiro is in November and Atlanta's is in October.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton proclaimed June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in 1999, marking the first time a U.S. president did so.",
      "When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he quickly attempted to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "He\u2019s especially targeted transgender people with policies that halted allowing people to change the sex listed on their passport, removed transgender military troops and sought to stop using federal insurance programs to pay for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19, and keep transgender athletes out of girls and women's sports competitions.",
      "All of those changes are being challenged in court.",
      "His actions follow years of policies in Republican-controlled states that bar gender-affirming care for transgender minors and dictate which sports transgender people can play and which school and other public bathrooms they are allowed to use. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on whether Tennessee's ban on medical treatment is constitutional.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s orders called for removing references to what he and some other conservatives call \u201cgender ideology\u201d from government publications and websites.",
      "A result of that: References to transgender people have been removed from government websites, including the one for the Stonewall National Monument, site of the event that inspired Pride.",
      "About half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling transgender issues, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last month. About 4 in 10 voters approve of his job as president overall.",
      "But support for his individual policies on transgender people is not uniformly strong, with a clearer consensus against policies that affect youth.",
      "Organizers of Milwaukee's PrideFest are prepared for close to 50,000 people at the event scheduled for June 5-7.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling that people will be showing up, and that\u2019s their protest,\u201d said Wes Shaver, the president and CEO of Milwaukee Pride, Inc.",
      "The event's theme is \u201cCelebrating the Power of Pride\u201d and for the first time, one of the entertainment stages one night will feature only transgender performers. Shaver said that's an intentional move in response to Trump's policies. Another night, the stage will feature only performers of color.",
      "Jeremy Williams, the executive producer of Philly Pride 365 in Philadelphia, said he didn't expect more protest than in the past there.",
      "\u201cEverybody's just there to be together,\u201d he said.",
      "One milestone that's likely to be celebrated: This month marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized same-sex marriage nationwide. It was a watershed event in establishing rights for LGBTQ+ people across the country.",
      "About two-thirds of LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. said the case made the nation more accepting of same-sex couples, according to a Pew Research Center poll released last week.",
      "The poll found that LGBTQ+ people don't always feel accepted, though. About 6 in 10 said they see \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d of social acceptance for those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. But only about 1 in 10 said the same is true for nonbinary and transgender people.",
      "Several big companies have pulled back on sponsorships for Pride events this year.",
      "Among them: Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based brewer, declined to sponsor PrideFest in its home city after three decades of support, leaving organizers $150,000 short of last year's budget, they told The Associated Press.",
      "NYC Pride said about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. The carmaker said it was reviewing all its marketing costs.",
      "In other cities, such as Kansas City, Missouri, pride events lost about half their budgets.",
      "Several companies that have pulled back have not explained why to the AP. But some experts see the change as part of a broader retreat from brand activism.",
      "Still, the groups behind many Pride events say some companies have kept contributing but have asked not to be listed publicly as sponsors.",

      "The California high school track-and-field championship has kicked off to a relatively quiet atmosphere",
      "CLOVIS, Calif. -- California\u2019s high school track-and-field state finals will award one extra medal Saturday in events where a transgender athlete places in the top three, a rule change that may be the first of its kind nationally by a high school sports governing body.",
      "The new California Interscholastic Federation policy was written in response to the success of high school junior AB Hernandez, a trans student who competes in the girls high jump, long jump and triple jump. She led in all three events after preliminaries Friday. The CIF said earlier this week it would let an additional student compete and medal in the events where Hernandez qualified.",
      "The two-day championship kicked off in the sweltering heat at high school near Fresno. The atmosphere was relatively quiet Friday despite critics \u2014 including parents, conservative activists and President Donald Trump \u2014 calling for Hernandez to be barred from girls competition leading up to the meet.",
      "There was some pushback Friday. A group of fewer than 10 people gathered outside the stadium ahead of the meet to protest Hernandez's participation. Some of them wore \u201cSave Girls\u2019 Sports\u201d T-shirts. At one point as Hernandez was attempting a high jump, someone in the stands yelled an insult. An aircraft circled above the stadium for more than an hour during the events, carrying a banner that read, \u201cNo Boys in Girls\u2019 Sports!\u201d",
      "The rest of the night ran smoothly for Hernandez, who finished the triple jump with a mark close to 41 feet (13 meters), nearly 10 inches (25 centimeters) ahead of her closest competitor, San Francisco Bay Area junior Kira Gant Hatcher.",
      "Hernandez also led in the long jump with a mark close to 20 feet (6 meters) to advance to the final. She advanced in the high jump, clearing 5 feet, 5 inches (1.7 meters) with ease.",
      "She did not address the press.",
      "The CIF rule change reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls\u2019 participation in youth sports.",
      "\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\u201d the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.",
      "A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats.",
      "The federation announced the rule change after Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The CIF said it decided on the change before then.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez\u2019s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.",
      "Some California Republicans also weighed in, with several state lawmakers attending a news conference to criticize the federation for keeping Hernandez in the competition and a Republican gubernatorial candidate planning to attend Saturday's finals.",
      "California law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The federation said the rule would open the field to more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes but not for other trans athletes.",
      "The federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\u201d or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn\u2019t worry about critics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "California\u2019s state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify. The state had the second-largest number of students participating in outdoor track and field in the nation during the 2023-2024 school year, behind Texas, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "Olympians Marion Jones and Tara Davis-Woodhall previously set state championship records in the long jump in 1993 and 2017, respectively, both surpassing 22 feet (6.7 meters).",
      "The boys 100-meter dash heats were also a highlight Friday. Junior Jaden Jefferson of De La Salle High School in Concord finished in 10.01 seconds, about .2 seconds faster than a meet record set in 2023. Jefferson's time won't count as a record unless he can replicate his results in the final.",

      "After years of sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride events around the country, some companies are pulling their financial support",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Many U.S. corporations this year stopped supporting Pride events that celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in budget shortfalls ahead of the summer festivities and raising questions about corporate America\u2019s commitment to the cause.",
      "The moves come as President Donald Trump has shown antipathy for trans protections and has attempted to roll back some LGBTQ+ friendly federal policies. Experts also note that a growing slice of the public has grown tired of companies taking a stance on social and political issues.",
      "San Francisco Pride, the nonprofit that produces one of the country\u2019s largest and best-known LGBTQ+ celebrations, is facing a $200,000 budget gap after corporate donors dropped out. In Kansas City, Missouri, KC Pride lost about $200,000 \u2014 roughly half its annual budget.",
      "Heritage of Pride, the umbrella organization behind NYC Pride and other LGBTQ+ events in New York City, is fundraising to narrow a $750,000 budget gap after companies withdrew.",
      "Meanwhile, Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch ended its sponsorship of PrideFest in St. Louis, Missouri, its home base, after 30 years, leaving organizers with a $150,000 budget shortfall.",
      "In response, many Pride organizations have canceled some dance parties, reduced the number of stages, hired less pricey headliners and no longer give volunteers free food or T-shirts.",
      "But the core celebrations will go on. In San Francisco, this year\u2019s Pride theme is \u201cQueer Joy is Resistance.\u201d In New York, it's \u201cRise Up: Pride in Protest,\u201d and, in Boston, it's \u201cHere to Stay!\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you come to Pride this year, that\u2019s a revolutionary act,\u201d said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride. \u201cYou are sending a message to those in Washington that, here in San Francisco, we still have the same values that we\u2019ve always had \u2014 you can love who you love here. We\u2019re not going to retreat from that.\u201d",
      "Following media coverage of their retreat, some companies changed course but asked that their names not be affiliated with the events, the event organizers said.",
      "San Francisco Pride earlier this year lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast, Anheuser-Busch and Diageo, the beverage giant that makes Guinness beer and Smirnoff vodka.",
      "\u201cWith everything we\u2019re facing from the Trump administration, to lose five of your partners within a couple of weeks, it felt like we were being abandoned,\u201d Ford said.",
      "After the withdrawals drew attention, some corporations said they would donate but only anonymously, Ford said, declining to identify those companies. As of this week, neither Comcast, Anheuser-Busch nor Diageo appeared on the organization\u2019s website as sponsors of the June 29 festivities. It was unclear if they donated.",
      "Anheuser-Busch and Diageo didn\u2019t reply to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. A spokesperson for Comcast also declined to comment but said some of its companies are sponsoring Silicon Valley Pride and Oakland Pride.",
      "NYC Pride spokesperson Chris Piedmont said about 20% of its corporate sponsors either dropped their support or scaled back, including New York-based PepsiCo and Nissan.",
      "Kyle Bazemore, Nissan North America's director of corporate communications, said the decision comes as the automaker reviews all of its marketing expenses to lower costs. PepsiCo did not return an email seeking comment.",
      "Piedmont said NYC Pride has also received anonymous corporate funding and that he appreciates the unpublicized support.",
      "\u201cWriting a check to a nonprofit and supporting a nonprofit with no strings attached is stepping up to the plate,\u201d Piedmont said.",
      "The shift reflects how corporations are adjusting to a changing cultural landscape that began during the pandemic and accelerated with Trump's second term, experts said.",
      "\u201cCompanies are resourceful, they are clever at identifying trends and studying their environment and their customers\u2019 needs, but those needs change and corporations adjust,\u201d said Amir Grinstein, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.",
      "Corporations' presence in rainbow-filled Pride parades, concerts and dance parties became more ubiquitous after the landmark 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, as companies splashed their names on parade floats, rainbow flags and bright plastic bracelets.",
      "So-called brand activism reached its peak between 2016 to 2022, a period of social upheaval around the pandemic, police brutality and transgender rights, Grinstein said.",
      "But research has since found a growing number of American consumers don't want companies taking positions on such topics, said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.",
      "\u201cThere have always been people who said, \u2018I don\u2019t want my toothpaste to have an opinion, I just want to use my toothpaste,\u2019 but the tide has shifted, and research shows there are more people that feel that way now,\" Kahn said.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican-led states have been passing legislation to curtail diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights, especially the ability of transgender young people to participate in sports or receive gender-affirming care.",
      "Trump signed executive orders on his first day in office that rolled back protections for transgender people and terminated federal DEI programs.",
      "Some companies followed suit by eliminating their DEI goals, prompting Pride organizations to sever ties.",
      "San Francisco's organizers cut ties with Meta after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram terminated its DEI goals and content moderation policies.",
      "Twin Cities Pride ended its relationship with Target over the Minneapolis-based retailer's curtailing of its DEI initiatives following a backlash from conservatives and the White House. The company's retreat from DEI policies led to a counter-boycott by civil rights advocates.",
      "Target announced in May that sales fell more than expected in the first quarter due to customer boycotts, tariffs and other economic factors. The company now offers only some Pride products at a few stores and online.",
      "Still, Rick Gomez, Target's chief commercial officer, told reporters in May that it's important to celebrate Heritage Months, which highlight different groups from Latinos to Asian Americans to the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"They drive sales growth for us,\u201d he said.",
      "First-time donations from individuals, foundations and local businesses have increased following corporate America's retreat.",
      "In Minneapolis, a crowdfunding campaign by Twin Cities Pride to fill a $50,000 funding gap raised more than $89,000.",
      "In San Francisco, two local foundations donated $55,000 combined.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first year that there\u2019s been an inflammatory climate around Pride,\u201d said James Moran, a spokesperson for KC Pride, in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cWe know that our community is looking for spaces that are meant for us, where we can celebrate but also process what\u2019s going on and build our own support networks.\u201d",

      "The third week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial featured testimony from the second of three women expected to testify that the hip-hop mogul sexually abused them",
      "NEW YORK -- Some of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 ex-employees took a central role in the third week of his sex trafficking trial, including personal assistants who testified that the hip-hop mogul was capricious, controlling and violent.",
      "The week began with Capricorn Clark, a personal assistant who was later a global brand director for Combs\u2019 company. She recalled witnessing Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, and said he raged about wanting to kill rapper and romantic rival Kid Cudi.",
      "It ended with another ex-assistant, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cMia,\" who alleges Combs raped her during a torturous eight-year tenure working for the rap star. She is the second of three women expected to testify that he sexually assaulted them. Combs has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The trial resumes Monday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Here are key moments from Week 3:",
      "Former employees of Combs\u2019 Bad Boy Entertainment described repeatedly witnessing him beat Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, but said they didn't report the abuse to law enforcement because they feared Combs would harm them.",
      "Clark testified that the day she started as Combs\u2019 personal assistant in 2004, he threatened he would kill her if her previous work for rival rappers interfered with her work for him.",
      "Then, she testified, she watched in shock as Combs viciously assaulted Cassie, his on-again, off-again girlfriend for more than a decade, in 2011 after learning she was dating Cudi. Clark said her \u201cheart was breaking from seeing her get hit like that,\" and neither she nor Combs\u2019 bodyguard intervened.",
      "She said she called Cassie's mother and told her: \u201cPlease help her. I can\u2019t call the police, but you can.\u201d",
      "Weeks later, Clark said, she reported what happened to Cassie to the president of Bad Boy Records.",
      "She also testified about her own run-ins with Combs, telling jurors that he kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her to Cudi\u2019s house as he fumed that he was going to kill the rapper. Cudi testified that he believed Cassie and Combs had broken up. He said his relationship with Cassie only lasted a few weeks.",
      "Clark said she stayed in Combs\u2019 SUV while he broke into the home. She said she was fired weeks later for what she contends was a trumped-up reason.",
      "One of the week\u2019s biggest developments came outside the courtroom. Cassie, 38, delivered her third child less than two weeks after testifying for four days as the prosecution\u2019s prize witness.",
      "The news of her son\u2019s birth Tuesday reached the jury the next day when Cassie\u2019s longtime stylist, Deonte Nash, testified that he was still close to Cassie and had sent her well wishes after the birth.",
      "Cassie, known for the platinum-selling 2006 hit single \u201cMe & U,\u201d married personal trainer Alex Fine in September 2019 \u2014 about a year after breaking up with Combs for good. Their first daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, was born in 2019. They welcomed a second daughter, Sunny Cinco Fine, in 2021.",
      "Jurors heard from a Los Angeles police officer who responded to the December 2011 break-in at Cudi\u2019s home and an arson investigator who spoke about his efforts to solve the firebombing of Cudi's Porsche 911 weeks later.",
      "Officer Chris Ignacio said he found Christmas gifts, some opened, with luxury watches and purses. Cudi has testified that his dog was traumatized after being locked in a bathroom by intruders.",
      "Ignacio said he saw a car with tinted windows registered to Bad Boy outside the house but didn't approach it because he had no proof a crime had occurred.",
      "Prosecutors are trying to prove that Combs was behind the break-in and the subsequent firebombing, which involved a Molotov cocktail dropped through a hole sliced in the convertible\u2019s fabric roof.",
      "Lance Jimenez, a Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator, said the explosive was made from a 40-ounce Olde English 800 malt liquor bottle and a silky designer handkerchief.",
      "\u201cI personally felt it was targeted,\u201d he said of the Jan. 9, 2012, attack.",
      "Celebrity stylist Deonte Nash was a witness like no other, adding flair and humor within seconds of taking the stand on Wednesday. Asked if he wanted to testify, he declared: \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d",
      "Nash said he knew Combs as \u201cPuff\u201d and Cassie as \u201cCass.\u201d He said he responded to a Craigslist ad and started working at Bad Boy Entertainment as an intern and then a stylist from 2008 to 2018.",
      "Prosecutor Maurene Comey put a picture of Nash in front of him and asked, \"Is it a glamour shot of you?\u201d",
      "\u201cYes. I look amazing,\u201d Nash responded, drawing laughs.",
      "Asked what he had heard Combs call Cassie over the years, Nash answered \u201cUm, Baby Girl, CC, Cass\u201d and then listed a number of slurs against women. Asked how often Combs used one particular slur, Nash said: \u201cUm, quite a bit. That was his fave.\u201d",
      "Nash later testified that Cassie had confided in him that she didn't always want to go along with Combs\u2019 demands that she have sex with other men during his drug-fueled \u201cfreak-off\u201d marathons.",
      "Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions: forcibly kissing her and putting his hand up her dress at his 40th birthday party, forcing her to perform oral sex as they packed for a trip, and raping her after he climbed into her bed at his Los Angeles home.",
      "Mia said she thought her sexual abuse was sporadic enough that each time it occurred, she thought it would never happen again. She said she put on a brave face and continued to work for Combs, in part because she felt shame, blamed herself and feared what would happen if she reported him to authorities.",
      "Cassie testified previously that Combs raped her after she broke up with him in 2018.",
      "Mia said she witnessed Combs physically attacking Cassie \u201call the time\u201d at his houses, her apartments, hotels, events and while traveling. She said Combs also turned his wrath on her, throwing her into a swimming pool, dumping a bucket of ice on her and hurling a bowl of spaghetti in her direction.",
      "Prosecutors insisted all week that they are ahead of schedule in presenting their case and said they could be done calling witnesses by mid-June.",
      "But Combs lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the defense\u2019s presentation might take longer than expected \u2014 particularly after prosecutors revealed they were making \u201cfairly substantial changes\u201d to their plan.",
      "\u201cIt may be that because of witnesses the government is not calling, we might have more on the defense case,\u201d he said.",
      "As a result, he added, the trial might run to the start of July.",

      "The 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail more than two weeks ago by cutting out a hole behind a toilet received help from at least 14 people, many of them friends and family who provided food, cash, transport and shelter according to court documents",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail more than two weeks ago by cutting out a hole behind a toilet received help from at least 14 people, many of them friends and family who provided food, cash, transport and shelter according to court documents.",
      "Records reviewed by The Associated Press show how some of the fugitives received aid before and after their escape \u2014 including from a number of people named in police reports but not yet facing charges.",
      "A former jail employee is accused of driving escapee Lenton Vanburen to a relative's home and helping him FaceTime family the day of the escape, while another friend later offered him a hiding place in a vacant apartment he had been hired to repaint.",
      "Others sent money via apps, lied to authorities during interrogation and messaged or called the fugitives, police say. Some are now held on bonds $1 million or higher and most face the felony charge of accessory after the fact.",
      "In a city with an entrenched mistrust of the criminal justice system, authorities on Thursday raised the reward to $50,000 per fugitive. They stressed that friends and family are key to capturing the two remaining escapees, convicted murderer Derrick Groves and Antoine Massey, who faces kidnapping and rape charges.",
      "\u201cWe understand that some of you might be reporting a friend, a loved one, a relative and albeit not easy, it is critical to your safety and the safety of the public that you report them,\u201d Jonathan Tapp, special agent in charge of FBI New Orleans, said Thursday.",
      "After the audacious escape in the early hours of May 16, a woman who police described as \u201cassociated\u201d with Groves \u201cpicked up\u201d and transported escapee Vanburen to a relative's residence, the documents show.",
      "She then video-called Vanburen's sisters, who came to meet him.",
      "This woman \u2014 who has not been charged with aiding in the escape \u2014 shares the same name as a former Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office employee, according to court records. In 2023, that employee was arrested for bringing a folding knife and a bag of Cheetos containing tobacco and marijuana into the jail.",
      "The charges were dropped in part due to the woman's lack of criminal history and she \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d a pretrial diversion program, the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office told The Associated Press. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office did not respond to request for comment.",
      "In a text message to an AP reporter, the woman denied bringing in contraband or aiding fugitives.",
      "Separately, authorities arrested a jail plumber they say helped the men escape, but his attorney maintains he was just trying to unclog a toilet.",
      "Several escapees, including Massey, relied on internet phone services to communicate with accomplices and \u201cavoid detection\" by not leaving a trail of cellular signals, police reports say.",
      "Escapee Corey Boyd used an internet phone service to message several contacts seeking money and access to their iCloud accounts, threatening to kill one person if they did not comply, court records show.",
      "The FBI reviewed months of calls from Boyd's \u201ctop caller\u201d while incarcerated. They then found a brief call from a new phone number the night after the escape and used that to help track down Boyd. They discovered that Boyd\u2019s aunt was messaging him on Instagram to help him get food as hid in the apartment where a SWAT team captured him May 20.",
      "One of the women accused of helping Massey suffered from years of physical abuse from him, court records show.",
      "The woman, who had previously filed a protective order against Massey after he attempted to strangle her, was aware of his planned escape and later misled authorities, police say.",
      "She exchanged messages with Massey\u2019s 31-year-old sister saying they hoped he \"never gets caught.\"",
      "Authorities staked out the New Orleans home of Massey\u2019s sister but a search six days after the escape turned up empty-handed. Police learned Massey had been inside the home before the raid and altered and deleted evidence on his sister's phone.",
      "Court records show police accuse Massey's sister of lying to them, slowing down the manhunt and forcing them to lose \u201ccritical days and hours\u201d in the search.",
      "At least seven of the people facing felony charges for aiding the fugitives have ties to Lenton Vanburen, Jr. according to authorities.",
      "After alerting two of his sisters by prison phone in the hours before his escape, he instructed they contact \u201cmy girl\u201d and provide her with a \u201cclean phone\u201d so the two could communicate.",
      "The woman identified by police as Vanburen's love interest told The Associated Press she never received the phone and denied involvement in the escape plans.",
      "Vanburen's sisters met up with him the night of his escape at a family member's residence where he was able to shower, change clothes and was given toiletries. Another family member later reportedly took him to a relative's home in Mississippi.",
      "Vanburen was ultimately captured in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Monday and two men arrested this week were accused of helping him find shelter in a hotel \u2014 paid for in cash \u2014 and an apartment undergoing renovation. The Baton Rouge court system had no record of their legal representation.",
      "In another case, a 59-year-old Louisiana woman is accused of sending cash to fugitive Jermaine Donald, a family friend, according to her attorney.",
      "Lindsey Hortenstine, communications director for the Orleans Parish Public Defenders\u2019 office, said that most of the people arrested in connection with helping the fugitives have not yet secured attorneys.",
      "Louisiana State Police Superintendent Colonel Robert Hodges said tips from friends and family remain essential to locating the remaining fugitives.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re tired, they\u2019re looking over their shoulder, looking for resources,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cI think the advantage goes to law enforcement and we need the public\u2019s help to ensure that we keep that advantage.\u201d",

      "Would U.S. companies go back to Russia if there\u2019s a peace deal over Ukraine",
      "Hundreds of foreign companies left Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including major U.S. firms like Coca-Cola, Nike, Starbucks, ExxonMobil and Ford Motor Co.",
      "But after more than three years of war, President Donald Trump has held out the prospect of restoring U.S.-Russia trade if there\u2019s ever a peace settlement. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has said foreign companies could come back under some circumstances.",
      "\u201cRussia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic \u2018bloodbath\u2019 is over, and I agree,\u201d Trump said in a statement after a phone call with Putin. \u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED.\u201d",
      "The president then shifted his tone toward Putin after heavy drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, saying Putin \u201chas gone absolutely crazy\u201d and threatening new sanctions. That and recent comments from Putin warning Western companies against reclaiming their former stakes seemed to reflect reality more accurately \u2014 that it\u2019s not going to be a smooth process for businesses going back into Russia.",
      "That\u2019s because Russia\u2019s business environment has massively changed since 2022. And not in ways that favor foreign companies.",
      "And with Putin escalating attacks and holding on to territory demands Ukraine likely isn\u2019t going to accept, a peace deal seems distant indeed.",
      "Here are factors that could deter U.S. companies from ever going back:",
      "Russian law classifies Ukraine\u2019s allies as \u201cunfriendly states\u201d and imposes severe restrictions on businesses from more than 50 countries. Those include limits on withdrawing money and equipment as well as allowing the Russian government to take control of companies deemed important. Foreign owners\u2019 votes on boards of directors can be legally disregarded.",
      "Companies that left were required to sell their businesses for 50% or less of their assessed worth, or simply wrote them off while Kremlin-friendly business groups snapped up their assets on the cheap. Under a 2023 presidential decree the Russian government took control of Finnish energy company Fortum, German power company Unipro, France\u2019s dairy company Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg.",
      "Even if a peace deal removed the U.S. from the list of unfriendlies, and if the massive Western sanctions restricting business in Russia were dropped, the track record of losses would remain vivid. And there\u2019s little sign any of that is going to happen.",
      "While the Russian government has talked in general about companies coming back, \u201cthere\u2019s no specific evidence of any one company saying that they are ready to come back,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s all at the political narrative level.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions and legal changes have left \u201clong-lasting damage\u201d to its business environment, says Elina Ribakova, non-resident senior fellow at the Bruegel research institute in Brussels.",
      "She said a return of U.S. businesses is \u201cnot very likely.\u201d",
      "In a meeting at the Kremlin on May 26 to mark Russian Entrepreneurs Day, Putin said that Russia needed to throttle large tech firms such as Zoom and Microsoft, which had restricted their services in Russia after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, so that domestic tech companies could thrive instead.",
      "\u201cWe need to strangle them,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAfter all, they are trying to strangle us: we need to reciprocate. We didn\u2019t kick anyone out; we didn\u2019t interfere with anyone. We provided the most favorable conditions possible for their work here, in our market, and they are trying to strangle us.\u201d",
      "He reassured a representative from Vkusno-i Tochka (Tasty-period) \u2014 the Russian-owned company that took over McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the country \u2014 that Moscow would aid them if the U.S. fast food giant tried to buy back its former stores. Asked for comment, McDonald\u2019s referred to their 2022 statement that \u201cownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.\u201d",
      "On top of Russia\u2019s difficult business environment, the economy is likely to stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military, economists say.",
      "\u201cRussia has one of the lowest projected long-term growth rates and one of the highest levels of country risk in the world,\u201d says Heli Simola, senior economist at the Bank of Finland in a blog post. \u201cOnly Belarus offers an equally lousy combination of growth and risk.\u201d",
      "Most of the opportunity to make money is related to military production, and it\u2019s unlikely U.S. companies would work with the Russian military-industrial complex, said Ribakova. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear where exactly one could plug in and expect outsize returns that would compensate for this negative investment environment.\u201d",
      "Some companies, including Renault and Ford Motor Co., left with repurchase agreements letting them buy back their stakes years later if conditions change. But given Russia\u2019s unsteady legal environment, that\u2019s tough to count on.",
      "The Russian purchasers may try to change the terms, look for more money, or ignore the agreements, said Weafer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how those buyback auctions will be enforced.\u201d",
      "Multinational oil companies were among those who suffered losses leaving Russia, so it\u2019s an open question whether they would want to try again even given Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves. US.. major ExxonMobil saw its stake in the Sakhalin oil project unilaterally terminated and wrote off $3.4 billion.",
      "Russia\u2019s major oil companies have less need of foreign partners than they did in the immediate post-Soviet era, though smaller oil field services might want to return given the size of Russia\u2019s oil industry. But they would have to face new requirements on establishing local presence and investment, Weafer said.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics, 2,329 foreign companies are still doing business in Russia, many from China or other countries that aren\u2019t allied with Ukraine, while 1,344 are in the process of leaving and 494 have exited completely. The Yale School of Management\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute lists some two dozen U.S. companies still doing business in Russia, while some 100 more have cut back by halting new investments.",
      "U.S. sanctions are considered the toughest, because they carry the threat of being cut off from the U.S. banking and financial system. But the EU is still slapping new rounds of sanctions on Russia. Even if U.S. sanctions are dropped, EU sanctions would continue to present compliance headaches for any company that also wants to do business in Europe.",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will seek to energize activists at Democratic state conventions in South Carolina and California on Saturday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will seek to energize activists at Democratic state conventions in South Carolina and California on Saturday, as the party's 2024 vice presidential nominee works to keep up the high national profile he gained when Kamala Harris selected him as her running mate.",
      "Walz, a former schoolteacher who went to Congress and then became his state\u2019s governor, will keynote the South Carolina gathering in Columbia, traditionally a showcase for national-level Democrats and White House hopefuls. Another leader who often appears on those lists, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, spoke Friday night at the party\u2019s fundraising dinner.",
      "South Carolina held the first Democratic presidential primary of the 2024 campaign, and the party hopes for a repeat as first in line in 2028. But the national party organizations haven't settled their 2028 calendars yet, and party officials in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada are also vying to go first.",
      "\u201cFrom the classroom to the governor\u2019s office, Tim Walz leads with compassion and common sense,\u201d the South Carolina party posted on social media earlier this month when it announced his appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s proof that you can govern with both heart and backbone, and he\u2019s bringing that message to South Carolina.\u201d",
      "Walz, who's on a long list of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early-voting states, will also be a featured speaker as California Democrats gather in Anaheim on Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fired up to welcome Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to the Convention stage in Anaheim,\u201d state chair Rusty Hicks said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s a former teacher, a veteran, and a trailblazer who\u2019s spent his career fighting for working families and standing up for the values we all share \u2014 fairness, dignity, and opportunity for all.\u201d",
      "Democrats have been debating since Harris lost to President Donald Trump in November over which direction the party should take. That self-examination reflects deep frustrations among Democratic voters that their leaders are failing to put up enough resistance against Trump, who has taken a much more aggressive approach to his second term in the White House.",
      "Walz hasn't officially said if he'll seek a third term in 2026, but acknowledges he's thinking about it. He said in a recent interview with KSTP-TV that he would probably wait to decide until July, after he calls a special session of the closely divided Minnesota Legislature to finish work on the state's next budget. Those negotiations have gone slowly despite his frequent meetings with legislative leaders.",
      "He's given mixed signals on a 2028 presidential run while keeping up his attacks on Trump. He told The New Yorker Radio Hour for an interview that aired in March that he would \u201ccertainly consider that\u201d if circumstances were right. He told CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d last month that he was \u201cnot thinking about running in 2028.\u201d",
      "But he hasn't ruled it out, either, and has signaled possible interest in other ways.",
      "Following the Democratic ticket's defeat in November, Walz returned to the road in March when he went to Iowa to launch a series of town halls in competitive congressional districts represented by Republicans, after House Speaker Mike Johnson advised GOP representatives to avoid holding town halls because of protests at them.",
      "Walz's gubernatorial campaign organization, which has been actively raising money, has used his travels in \u201cSupport Tim on the Road\u201d fundraising pitches.",
      "\u201cFor the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been showing up where Republicans won\u2019t,\u201d he wrote in one recent message. \u201cI\u2019ve hosted town halls in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Texas to hear from people the GOP is neglecting.\u201d",

      "The explosive growth of the data centers needed to power America\u2019s fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing has spurred states to dangle incentives in hopes of landing an economic bonanza",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The explosive growth of the data centers needed to power America's fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing platforms has spurred states to dangle incentives in hopes of landing an economic bonanza, but it's also eliciting pushback from lawmakers and communities.",
      "Activity in state legislatures \u2014 and competition for data centers \u2014 has been brisk in recent months, amid an intensifying buildout of the energy-hungry data centers and a search for new sites that was ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Many states are offering financial incentives worth tens of millions of dollars. In some cases, those incentives are winning approval, but only after a fight or efforts to require data centers to pay for their own electricity or meet energy efficiency standards.",
      "Some state lawmakers have contested the incentives in places where a heavy influx of massive data centers has caused friction with neighboring communities. In large part, the fights revolve around the things that tech companies and data center developers seem to most want: large tracts of land, tax breaks and huge volumes of electricity and water.",
      "And their needs are exploding in size: from dozens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts and from dozens of acres up to hundreds of acres for large-scale data centers sometimes called a hyperscaler.",
      "While critics say data centers employ relatively few people and pack little long-term job-creation punch, their advocates say they require a huge number of construction jobs to build, spend enormous sums on goods and local vendors and generate strong tax revenues for local governments.",
      "In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are writing legislation to fast-track permitting for data centers. The state is viewed as an up-and-coming data center destination, but there is also a sense that Pennsylvania is missing out on billions of dollars in investment that's landing in other states.",
      "\u201cPennsylvania has companies that are interested, we have a labor force that is capable and we have a lot of water and natural gas,\u201d said state Rep. Eric Nelson. \"That\u2019s the winning combination. We just have a bureaucratic process that won\u2019t open its doors.\u201d",
      "Kansas approved a new sales tax exemption on goods to build and equip data centers, while Kentucky and Arkansas expanded pre-existing exemptions so that more projects will qualify.",
      "Michigan approved one that carries some protections, including requirements to use municipal utility water and clean energy, meet energy-efficiency measures and ensure that it pays for its own electricity.",
      "Such tax exemptions are now so widespread \u2014 about three dozen states have some version of it \u2014 that it is viewed as a must-have for a state to compete.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s often a nonstarter if you don\u2019t have them, for at least the hyperscalers,\u201d said Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a massive impact on the overall spend of the data center.\u201d",
      "In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to create \u201cmicrogrid\u201d districts free from local zoning and electric rate regulations where data centers can procure power from standalone power plants.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called the bill his \u201clandmark policy proposal\u201d for 2025 to put West Virginia \u201cin a class of its own to attract new data centers and information technology companies.\u201d",
      "Utah and Oklahoma passed laws to make it easier for data center developers to procure their own power supply without going through the grid while Mississippi rolled out tens of millions of dollars in incentives last year to land a pair of Amazon data centers.",
      "In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed legislation earlier this month that eased regulations to speed up power plant construction to meet demand from data centers, including a massive Facebook facility.",
      "The final bill was fought by some lawmakers who say they worried about data centers using disproportionate amounts of water, taking up large tracts of land and forcing regular ratepayers to finance the cost of new power plants.",
      "\u201cI do not like that we\u2019re making customers pay for two power plants when they only need one,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told colleagues during floor debate.",
      "Still, state Sen. Russell Ott suggested that data centers should be viewed like any other electricity customer because they reflect a society that is \u201caddicted\u201d to electricity and are \u201cfilling that need and that desire of what we all want. And we're all guilty of it. We\u2019re all responsible for it.\u201d",
      "In data center hotspots, some lawmakers are pushing back.",
      "Lawmakers in Oregon are advancing legislation to order utility regulators to ensure data centers pay the cost of power plants and power lines necessary to serve them.",
      "Georgia lawmakers are debating a similar bill.",
      "In Virginia, the most heavily developed data center zone in the U.S., Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have forced more disclosures from data center developers about their site's noise pollution and water use.",
      "In Texas, which endured a deadly winter blackout in 2021, lawmakers are wrestling with how to protect the state's electric grid from fast-growing data center demand.",
      "Lawmakers still want to attract data centers, but a bill that would speed up direct hookups between data centers and power plants has provisions that are drawing protests from business groups.",
      "Those provisions would give utility regulators new authority to approve those agreements and order big electric users such as data centers to switch to backup generators in a power emergency.",
      "Walt Baum, the CEO of Powering Texans, which represents competitive power plant owners, warned lawmakers that those provisions might be making data center developers hesitant to do business in Texas.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a lot of new announcements in other states and over the last several months and not as much here in Texas,\" Baum told House members during a May 7 committee hearing. \"I think everybody right now is in a waiting pattern and I worry that we could be losing to other states while that waiting pattern is happening.\u201d",

      "A single photo sparked a 25-year search in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- It wasn't going to be easy to track down the woman who came to be known as \u201cMiss Atomic Bomb.\" All Robert Friedrichs had to go on was a stage name he found printed under an archival newspaper photo that showed her posing with other Las Vegas showgirls.",
      "It would take him more than two decades to unravel the mystery of Lee A. Merlin's true identity.",
      "Friedrichs, 81, isn\u2019t a detective. He\u2019s a historian and a retired scientist who got his start during the atomic age, a complicated moment in American history when the line was blurred between fear and fascination with nuclear power.",
      "Between 1951 and 1992, hundreds of nuclear tests were performed, mostly underground, in the desert outside Las Vegas. But it was the massive mushroom clouds from the above-ground nuclear blasts that captured the public\u2019s imagination throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.",
      "Las Vegas sought to capitalize on that craze, and in 1957 sent a photographer out on assignment to shoot a promotional ad for nuclear tourism. He got an idea to capture the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel in a swimsuit in the shape of a fluffy mushroom cloud. In the photo, the high-heeled showgirl is smiling with arms outstretched as the desert unfolds behind her like a stage.",
      "The image played a key role in shaping Las Vegas \u2019 identity as a city of fantasy and spectacle. Yet little was known about the star of the photo \u2014 until now.",
      "Friedrichs first set out to find Miss Atomic Bomb around 2000. The Atomic Museum was set to open in Las Vegas in a few years and as a founding member, he was \u201choping against hope\u201d that she was still alive and could attend the grand opening.",
      "What started as a simple question \u2014 Who was she? \u2014 became an obsession for Friedrichs that outlasted careers and outlived friends.",
      "Friedrichs filled stacks of binders with clues and potential leads, like one that led him \u201cto a guy in South Dakota.\" Days off were spent either combing through online newspaper archives or sifting through special collections at the library.",
      "He tracked down the photographer from that famous photoshoot and interviewed former showgirls who confirmed Miss Atomic Bomb's stage name. But the woman\u2019s real name still eluded him.",
      "Leads dried up and months turned into years.",
      "The mystery didn\u2019t keep him up at night, but he said when he was awake, it consumed his thoughts. He would sometimes stare at the photo, wondering if she\u2019d ever give up the answer.",
      "Then, last winter, something unexpected happened. He gave a talk at the Atomic Museum about his search, and the next day, an audience member sent him a copy of an obituary. A detail stood out: The woman had once been the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel.",
      "Her name was Anna Lee Mahoney.",
      "She was born on Aug. 14, 1927, in the Bronx. Mahoney trained in ballet in New York before performing in shows and musicals under her stage name, Lee A. Merlin.",
      "By 1957, she was the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel\u2019s Copa showroom, a frequent haunt of the Rat Pack and mobsters. She performed for elite audiences, including Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong, according to her obituary.",
      "After hanging up her dancing shoes, Mahoney worked for 30 years as a mental health counselor, moved to Hawaii and got married. She died in 2001 in Santa Cruz, California, after a battle with cancer.",
      "Her photograph is one of the most requested of the 7.5 million images kept in the Las Vegas Convention Center and Visitors Authority\u2019s archive. It has inspired Halloween costumers, and former Playboy Bunny Holly Madison recreated it in 2012. One of the outtakes from the famous shoot appears in the background of an episode of \u201cCrime Story,\u201d a police TV drama set in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just really amazing that one click of the shutter could have such an impact,\u201d Friedrichs said.",
      "A temporary exhibit showcasing the decades-long search opens June 13 at the Atomic Museum.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about Miss Atomic Bomb, about Anna Lee Mahoney,\u201d said Joseph Kent, the museum\u2019s deputy director and curator, \u201cbut it\u2019s also about Robert\u2019s quest to find out her real identity.\u201d",
      "Over the years, the project had become deeply personal for Friedrichs.",
      "He and the photographer, Don English, became fast friends after their first meeting. Before the Atomic Museum opened to the public, Friedrichs took English inside to tour the space. English brought the original camera he used to take the infamous photo.",
      "English posed in the lobby for a photo with a life-sized cardboard cutout of \u201cMiss Atomic Bomb.\u201d Friedrichs jokes it\u2019s his favorite of all the photos he\u2019s collected of her in 25 years.",
      "English died in 2006, long before Friedrichs solved the mystery. Instead he called English\u2019s daughter to share the news.",
      "\u201cShe was really excited that we had gotten this put to bed,\u201d Friedrichs said.",
      "And then there were the showgirls who spent hours talking with Friedrichs. They shared their stage names and stories about vintage Vegas \u2014 fancy dinners, photoshoots and lavish gifts like a beautiful citrine ring that one of them got from a man who wanted to marry her.",
      "The women provided a glimpse into the atomic era, life as Copa showgirls and how they became icons of Las Vegas, yet were sometimes misidentified in photo captions or their names altogether omitted.",
      "And finally, with the help of private investigators who donated their time, Friedrichs uncovered conclusive evidence linking all of Miss Atomic Bomb\u2019s names to a single Social Security number.",
      "\u201cIt's something I always hoped would be completed in my lifetime,\" said Friedrichs, teary-eyed.",
      "His motivation to solve the mystery didn\u2019t come from curiosity alone. The missing name was a gap in the historical record, he said, and he wanted to fix it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like knowing someone was the first president of the United States, but what was his name again?\u201d",

      "\"'Madleen' sails to Gaza today with twelve humanitarians and as much life-saving aid as she can carry, including baby formula, medical supplies, and more. She departs from European territorial waters, sailing entirely through international waters into Palestinian waters off Gaza,\" the coalition wrote\u00a0in a social media post Sunday. \"Unarmed and nonviolent, 'Madleen' poses no threat. She sails in full accordance with international law. Any attack or interference will be a deliberate, unlawful assault on civilians.\"",

      "\"We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\" Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",

      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-clinton-and-james-patterson-on-their-new-thriller-the-first-gentleman/",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:10:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-macfarlane-from-family-guy-to-lush-life-the-lost-sinatra-arrangements/",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Jun 2025 09:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The writer-producer-voice artist behind the animated hit is also a crooner of the Great American Songbook. He is now releasing a new album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements.\"",
    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely, his composer and arranger for \"Family Guy,\" combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Emmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.",

      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its warning about the risk of contracting measles while traveling, after the agency tallied dozens of cases so far this year in travelers who were infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S.",
      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, the CDC has received at least 62 reports of travelers who were contagious with the highly transmissible virus while flying into the U.S. or within the country, a spokesperson for the health agency told CBS News in a statement.",
      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",
      "The changes come as the CDC's tally of measles cases has begun to show signs of accelerating again.",
      "At least 1,088 cases of measles have been reported so far this year, the CDC said Friday, with two more states \u2014 Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 now reporting their first confirmed cases. Around 90% of confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks within the U.S., not travel outside the country.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs.

      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",

      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",

      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",

      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",

      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U.

The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",

    "summary": "As the trade standoff with China continues, President Trump announced the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday defended the Trump administration's escalating tariff policies, saying that while some companies have already announced price hikes, he thinks others will\u00a0 choose not to.",
      "\"Some are and some aren't,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" He pointed to companies like Home Depot and Amazon who have indicated they will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, whereas others, such as Walmart and Best Buy, have signaled potential price increases.",
      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

    "summary": "Higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic in Las Vegas, but casual trips are down.",
    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",

      "The investigation into the bitcoin torture case in New York City has revealed gruesome details about the alleged kidnapping and beating of an Italian man for his fortune in the cryptocurrency.",
      "What we know about the bitcoin torture case",
      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

    "story": [
      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",
      "The trademark lawsuit is not the first for Aldi, which been called out numerous times over its products' packaging. Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 16:04:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

      "The median sale price for homes in McAllen \u2014 $204,499 \u2014 is about four times as much as the median local income, giving buyers more moderate wiggle room when it comes to affordability.",
      "Best in affordability",
      "When looking solely at affordability \u2014 the median sale price of a home relative to the median local income \u2014 Midwestern metro areas reign. Illinois cities Peoria and Decatur top the ranking in affordability, according to SmartAsset. Other locales house hunters may want to keep an eye on include Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Davenport, Iowa; Muncie, Indiana; Springfield, Illinois; and St. Joseph, Missouri, which are among the least expensive metro areas, according to the study.",
      "While Midwestern cities ranked higher in affordability than others, only Lawton, Oklahoma, where homes have a median sale price of $150,007, made it into SmartAsset's top 10 cities for first-time homebuyers overall.",
      "Best place for expanded inventory",
      "One of biggest issues plaguing the housing market is the limited supply of homes for sale While studies show\u00a0that the inventory of available properties is rising in many markets, some metro areas are still suffering from\u00a0shortages, which increases competition and prices for homebuyers.",
      "If you're looking for more robust inventory, you may want to consider heading south. Cape Coral, Florida, offers the greatest number of homes for sale per capita, according to SmartAsset, followed by Port St. Lucie, Florida.",

      "President Trump on Friday said that China is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year.",
      "Mr. Trump didn't specify in what way he believes China is violating the agreement. On May 12, the two nations committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "As part of the agreement, China also said it would also ease some nontariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, High Frequency Economics said at the time.",
      "Rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, could be at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint, said equities analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge on Friday.",

(For the higher income earners among them especially, summer will also involve travel.)",

      "Those in comparably lower income levels report feeling stress about finances more often. Stress and concern go up with feeling less secure in a job (for those employed.) Concern about monthly ability to pay for food and groceries is strongly associated with more frequent feelings of stress. Conversely, feelings of being secure or optimistic financially are linked to confidence in being able to save, buy extras and pay for the basics.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",

      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

The ruling emphasizes that he was wrong to claim a virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs, that IEEPA law doesn't grant any such boundless authority, and that it would be unconstitutional if it did.\" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University involved in one of the lawsuits before the U.S. Court of International Trade, said in a statement.",
      "Following the decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs deriving from a series of executive orders invoking IEEPA are unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras found that the law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in five of his orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the plaintiffs in the case, two family-owned businesses based in Illinois. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a 33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers with the trade court that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has said that if the appeals court declines to provide interim relief in the coming hours, the U.S. will ask the Supreme Court to intervene Friday.",
      "\"Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,\" the Justice Department filing said.",
      "The department has also asked the U.S. Court of International Trade to pause enforcement of its ruling pending appeal. That court has given the states and small businesses until Friday at 12 p.m. to respond to the government's stay request.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" Somin\u00a0told CBS News earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling\u00a0voided both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily suspended the trade court's decision freezing the tariffs, reinstating the levies for now.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loans-credit-scores-plunge/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:41:02 -0400",
    "summary": "New delinquency reports will hurt the credit scores of borrowers who fail to make payments on their student loans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments earlier this month is taking a toll on many borrowers' credit records.",
      "Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For its report, the Fed looked at a borrower delinquency rate based on shares of student loan borrowers with at least one student loan reported as past due or in default.",
      "Another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points for the first three months of 2025. A low credit score makes securing future loans both more difficult and more costly, pushing milestones like buying a home, or saving for retirement, further out of reach. It can even impact one's employment prospects.",
      "\"The key risk is that this could lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans, which could reduce delinquent borrowers' access to credit, which would then be used for other areas of spending such as on cars and mortgages,\" Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some 2.4 million of the newly delinquent borrowers previously had credit scores above 620, which are considered good and would have allowed them to qualify for new car loans, mortgages and credit cards before the delinquencies were reported, Fed researchers said.",
      "\"These borrowers saw substantial declines in their credit standing in the first quarter and will now face steeper borrowing costs or denial for new credit,\" Fed researchers said in the report.",
      "Grace period expires",
      "Student loan repayments were paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by President Trump in March 2020, during his first term. After multiple extensions of the payment pause by former President Biden, repayments resumed in October 2023.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education then instituted a 12-month \"on ramp\" period which expired in October 2024, to give student borrowers some leniency as they resumed payments. During the transition period, loan servicers did not report missed payments or delinquent loans to credit bureaus, protecting many student borrowers from the worst consequences of not making their payments. Borrowers are considered delinquent on their loans when a payment is more than 90 days late.",
      "The pandemic-era pause on repayment had a positive effect on borrowers' credit scores: Between 2019 and 2024, the number of borrowers with credit scores below 620 fell by more than 4 million, as borrowers moved into higher credit score brackets, an analysis from Oxford economics shows.",
      "With that grace period having ended on May 5, newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores are also being dinged, as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus.",
      "\"Borrowers receiving a new delinquency will see a drop in their credit score. This may signal a reversal of the positive credit score trend seen during the pandemic, which would lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in a report.",
      "Long-lasting consequences",
      "Substantial drops in delinquent student borrowers' credit scores will have long-lasting ramifications for those affected, including lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and limited access to credit in general, according to experts.",
      "\"The long-term issue is they'll have trouble accessing other types of loans in the future, like mortgage and car loans. It's easier to build credit scores when you don't have negative data, but when you have a delinquency, it's hard to come out of that. It takes a lot of effort,\" Tushar Bagamane, CEO of budgeting tool Vola Finance, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Consumers with multiple delinquencies report having to pay \"exorbitantly high on interest\" on larger loans once a delinquency impacts their credit score, Bagamane said.",
      "\"They have to pay more on their home loans and the cost of those lines of credit affects the income they have left after meeting their essential needs,\" he said. \"The ability to refinance existing loans with a low credit score can be prohibitively expensive and at that point, borrowers are almost left outside the financial system.\"",
      "By that he means they can't achieve milestones like owning a home or acquiring other assets, \"which is not a good position to be in,\" Bagamane added.",
      "American dream increasingly out of sight",
      "Zwemmer, of Oxford Economics, noted that a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years, and so avoiding becoming delinquent on a loan in the first place is the best course of action. If millions of student borrowers drop into lower credit score brackets, it could exacerbate the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans.",
      "\"Older and lower-income segments of the population will be most impacted, so we'll be looking to see if there's a further bifurcation of U.S. consumers,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "Jason Ackerman, a certified public accountant and co-founder of WealthRabbit, a retirement planning platform, said that as their credit scores drop, those who can least afford to shoulder higher borrowing costs will see their rates rise.",
      "\"Younger people are getting further behind on the American dream of buying a house and saving for retirement,\" Ackerman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Their payments get higher \u2014 and the more you're putting toward student loans, the less you can put toward other things.\"",

We are working to quickly and securely restore operations.\"",
      "Victoria's Secret also didn't specify when it first identified the issue and began pulling back services. Most media reports of the retailer's website going dark emerged Wednesday \u2014 when the company also shared an update on social media \u2014 but some frustrated customers online said they began experiencing issues earlier in the week, as far back as Monday.",

      "Shares for Victoria's Secret tumbled about 4% as of midday Thursday.",
      "While not confirmed by the company, the \"security incident\" impacting Victoria's Secret's operations bears all the hallmarks of a cyberattack. And it arrives as more and more companies report breaches that disrupt operations and/or expose customer data.",
      "Last week, for example, Adidas announced that it had recently become aware of an \"unauthorized external party\" obtaining some consumer data \u2014 mostly consisting of contact information \u2014 through a third-party customer service provider. The German shoe and clothing company said it would be informing impacted customers and working with law enforcement.",
      "And several British retailers \u2014 Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op \u2014 have all shared that they've been targeted by cyberattacks over recent weeks. The cyberattack hitting M&S stopped it from processing online orders and left store shelves empty, with the company estimating that this will cost it 300 million pounds ($400 million).",
      "And following any cybersecurity incident impacting a consumer-facing brand, experts warn that it's important for shoppers to be alert. Fraudsters might promise fake promotions through phishing emails, for example, or use sensitive information that may have been compromised.",

      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",

      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added.

A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 a week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

      "AB Hernandez, a Jurupa Valley High School junior, competed in several events on Saturday after finishing as the top qualifier in the girls' high jump, long jump and triple jump on Friday.",
      "\"There's no words to express how proud I am of her, despite her being targeted, harassed for all these months. She's here, she's successful, she did it,\" said Hernandez's mother Nereyda. \"When you're actually here the whole event, you actually see, it's not just hating. There's more support, there's more love.\"",
      "Hernandez took home first place medals in both high jump and triple jump and she placed second in the long jump event. Following a rule change by the California Interscholastic Federation, a co-winner was named in each of the three events in which Hernandez placed.",
      "The\u00a0policy change\u00a0allows an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events in which a transgender athlete also qualified.",
      "\"If necessary, in the high jump, triple jump and long jump events at the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships, a biological female student-athlete who would have earned a specific placement on the podium will also be awarded the medal for that place and the results will be reflected in the recording of the event,\" CIF officials said in a statement issued on Wednesday.",
      "\"The CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\" the statement said.",
      "Related:\u00a0Nationwide debate over Jurupa Valley transgender athlete's eligibility in CIF finals continues",
      "CIF officials announced the new policy days before the championships, which then drew a response from the U.S. Department of Justice as they launched a Title IX investigation over transgender athlete participation in California high school sports.",
      "Their rule change was announced less than a day after Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to comment on the matter, threatening to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed.",
      "Some high school coaches who had student-athletes participating in the finals offered their support for Hernandez, including Santa Margarita High School's Bryn Williams.",
      "\"This is still a high schooler,\" Williams said. \"She is learning, she is navigating the world just like we are every single day and that I know I would want grace if I was put in a situation where I had a bunch of light on me and what I was doing. So I encourage people to remember that. We are all human and at the end of the day we are all trying to navigate this world.\"",
      "The finals began Friday at Buchanan High School in Clovis, which is located in Fresno County. Aside from the crowd that gathered to support participating athletes, the event also drew about 20 protesters who denounced Hernandez's participation. Some could be seen holding signs that read \"Save Girls Sports\" and an airplane also flew over the event pulling a banner that read, \"No Boys in Girls' Sports.\"",
      "One person was arrested following an altercation between counterprotesters, Clovis police said. Video shows the moments that the person is taken into custody by officers, as well as the moments leading up to their arrest, when they shoved a flag pole through someone's window.",

      "\"I think it's completely unfair to these girls,\" said Josh Fulfer. \"They've worked hard. He has an advantage by being a male and it's really unfortunate that these girls, the psychological effect that it has on them and places on them when they know they're not only competing against people of their own sex, but now they gotta go up against a man. ... I think it's really bad that we're setting this precedent.\"",
      "Despite this, business continued as usual inside the stadium, and the events were completed without disruption."

She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not, When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",

      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",

      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Trump.",

      "Of a call between the two leaders, \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said in April that he spoke to his Chinese counterpart about tariffs, but Beijing denied that a direct conversation took place. Mr. Trump has vowed since he took office in January to speak with Xi, but no formal plans have been announced.",
      "Weeks after the U.S. and China agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs imposed on imports earlier in the year, Mr. Trump said Friday that China was violating the trade agreement, though he didn't outline the alleged violations.",

      "Last month, the U.S. and China committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies that had been imposed since early April, reducing the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to about 30%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller outlined to reporters Friday that China had \"abrogated the agreement.\"",
      "\"China did not fulfill the obligations that it made and committed to with the United States. And so that opens up all manner of action for the United States to ensure future compliance,\" Miller said. \"It remains the President's hope and desire that China will choose the path of cooperation, of common ground, and that we can open up China to American business just in the same way that America, of course, that we all know has been open to Chinese business for a very long time now.\"",
      "Miller said the U.S. wants to see China comply with the agreement and fulfill its obligations \"as soon as possible\" to ensure a \"cooperative\" and \"constructive\" relationship that he said the president wants.",
      "On Sunday, Bessent acknowledged that the products China is withholding include critical minerals, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. The export of rare earths was thought to be at the center of the disagreement.",
      "\"The fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement \u2014 maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it's intentional,\" Bessent said. \"We'll see after the president speaks with party chairman.\"",

      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were last here in March, we were trying to gauge what the impact of the standoff with China and with the tariffs on the rest of the world would do for American consumers here at home.",
      "At that time, you told us you were going to appoint an affordability czar and council to figure out five \u2013 you said, or eight areas where there will be some pain for working-class Americans. Where are you anticipating price increases?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, thus far \u2013 we wanted to make sure that there aren't price increases, Margaret. And, thus far, there have been no price increases. Everything has been alarmist, that the inflation numbers are actually dropping.",
      "We saw the first drop of inflation in four years. The inflation numbers last week, they were very \u2013 the \u2013 pro-consumer. We've seen\u2026",

      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But, Margaret, I also know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying. I know what the \"South China Morning Post\" wrote within the past 24 hours, that 65 percent, 65 percent \u2013 the \u2013 of the tariffs will likely be eaten by the Chinese producers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are there five or eight areas that you have identified, as you said back in March, where American consumers will be able to have lower prices, or should be warned of higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a lot of it's already working its way through the system. So we've seen a substantial decrease in gasoline and energy prices. So that's down 20 percent year over year.",
      "We've seen the food prices go down, these notorious egg prices. Through the good work of President Trump and Secretary Rollins, egg prices have collapsed. So we're seeing more and more. And what we want to do, the \u2013 is even that out across the \u2013 all sections of the economy.",
      "So, inflation has been very tame. Consumer earnings were up 0.8 percent last month, which is a gigantic increase for one month. So, real earnings minus low inflation is great for the American people, and that's what we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, because when you met with the Chinese earlier this month, and you went down from the 145 percent tariff down to about \u2013 it's like 30 percent; 30 percent's not nothing, that tax on goods coming in here.",

      "And I was in the investment business for 35 years, Margaret, and I will tell you earnings calls, they have to give the worst-case scenario, because if it \u2013 if they haven't and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.",

It can't absorb the cost of an imported pair of kids jeans with a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 37 percent tariff for Bangladesh, or 32 percent tariff on sneakers from Indonesia. Other companies are in the same pickle.\"",

Maybe. But it's going to impact the steel industry the \u2013 in a great way. The steelworkers, again, were left on the side of the road after the China shock, and now they're back, that the \u2013 they are Trump supporters.",

      "One of the reasons I'm sitting here talking to you today and not at home watching your show is that I was concerned about the level of debt.

      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the treasury secretary say a number of things, dismissed the potential price increases that could come from the tariffs when it comes to retailers. He also played down the cost of this tax and border bill that just passed through the House.",
      "Do you agree with his math?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, the math doesn't really add up.",
      "One of the things this big and beautiful bill is, is, it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border. It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we have found so far. So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts.",
      "When you look just at the border wall, they have $46.5 billion for the border wall. Well, the current estimate from the CBP is $6.5 million per mile. So if you did 1,000 miles, that's $6.5 billion, but they have $46 billion. So they have inflated the cost of the wall eightfold.",
      "So there's a lot of new spending that has to be counteracted. But, essentially, this is a bill by the military industrial complex advocates who are padding the military budget. There's going to be a lot of extra money.",
      "Look, the president has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any new legislation. So I think they're asking for too much money. And, in the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money is, how much debt are they going to borrow?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Five trillion over two years, enormous amount.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That was the number that the secretary was quibbling over.",
      "The president has taken note of some of your skepticism, and he did tweet yesterday, saying that if you, Rand Paul, vote against his massive border and tax bill, the people of Kentucky will never forgive you.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you consider that a threat? And do you know if you have three other Republicans who will join you to block it from passage?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I had a very good conversation with the president this week about tariffs. He did most of the talking, and we don't agree exactly on the outcome.",
      "But when I come home to Kentucky, I talk to the Farm Bureau, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the bourbon industry, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the cargo companies, UPS, DHL. All of their pilots are opposed to it. I talk to the hardwood floor people. I talk to the people selling houses, building houses.",
      "I have no organized business \u2013 business interest in Kentucky for the tariffs. So I think it's worth the discussion, and it's worth people remembering that the Republicans used to be for lower taxes. Tariffs are a tax.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, if you raise taxes on the private sector, that's not good for the private sector.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we hear from other senators who also get complaints from their \u2013 people in their districts, but they're falling in line. Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction.",
      "Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent. But, at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So I have told them, if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I can't be \u2013 if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt? We will have lost.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader, as you know, is sort of in a tight spot here. He needs a vehicle to raise that debt ceiling. Otherwise, you had to turn to Democrats to get that done.",
      "What was the White House response when you asked that to the president?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, historically, the debt ceiling has always gone up and will always go up, and I'm not proposing that it doesn't. But the people who should vote for it are the people who vote for the spending.",
      "Historically, all the Democrats vote for raising the debt ceiling, and about 15 big government Republicans vote for it. This will be the first time it's voted on just by Republicans. This will be the first time that Republicans own the debt. They already own the spending.",
      "In March, we continued, not me, but most Republicans voted to continue the Biden spending levels. So, you will remember the campaign. Everybody was talking about Bidenomics and Biden inflation and Biden spending levels. Well, the Republicans all voted to keep the Biden spending levels, and that's why the deficit this year is going to be $2.2 trillion this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think is this bad politics for Republicans?",
      "Some of your Republican colleagues like Josh Hawley are saying that the changes to Medicaid are bad politics for America's working people and for your party.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it was a bad strategy. I think the tax cuts are good for the economy. When we passed the tax cuts in 2017, the economy grew like gangbusters. We had lowest unemployment historically. It was the great achievement of Trump's first administration.",
      "They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and not getting involved into the debt part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were with us in March, you talked about conversations you had with Elon Musk. As you know, he's just left his work with the administration.",
      "You had proposed a rescission request, a clawback of about $500 billion from money Congress had already signed off on. We know now that the White House is going to ask Congress this week for some rescissions. Sounds like it's just $9.4 billion. And it's PBS, it's NPR and it's foreign aid.",
      "Is this really the best strategy? And do you think 51 Republican senators are on board with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: First of all, I will vote for spending cuts, the more, the better. This is very, very small. To put it in perspective, if the deficit this year is $2.2 trillion, if you cut $9 billion, the deficit is going to be $2.191 trillion.",
      "It really doesn't materially change the course of the country. We should do it, by all means, and it is the low-hanging fruit. This is the money that was pointed out that was being spent for sex change operations in Guatemala, trans opera in Columbia, all this crazy spending. Yes, it should be cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sesame Street.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I had an amendment about a month \u2013 excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sesame Street. It's PBS and NPR.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Yes. And I think \u2013 yes, you're right. We will see if there's the votes to cut it.",
      "I don't think we necessarily need government programming anymore. We have so many choices on the Internet and so many choices on television. But my preference has always been in the past to cut a little bit of everything, rather than cut a lot of something.",
      "So what I have done in the past is propose a penny plan budget where we cut a certain percentage of everything, but it includes entitlements or it doesn't really work. Once you exclude the entitlements, there isn't enough money to cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So you can never achieve balance by not looking at the entitlements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The budget director on another program this morning said they may not need to use this rescission, this clawback, because the White House has other tools. Do you think they need to go through Congress? Is this overstepping?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, they absolutely have to use a recession \u2013 the rescission.",
      "And it is done by simple majority, by Republicans only. There is no filibuster of it. So it's a great tool to cut spending. If they don't use it, it will be a huge wasted opportunity. But I will tell you, they tried in the first Trump administration. And it wasn't their fault. They sent a tiny one, $16 billion, and it failed because two Republicans went the other way.",
      "So we will see what happens on this, but if we can't even cut welfare that we're giving to other countries, if we can't cut foreign aid welfare, I feel bad for the country. Interest rates are rising. We're having trouble selling our debt. We have got a lot of problems.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so this appears to be a subvariant of JN1, which has been the dominant strain. So, it's believed that there is cross immunity protection. The Covid virus is going to continue to mutate and it's behaving like a common cold virus. It's now going to become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal that causes about 25 percent of the cases of the common cold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're thinking of it as like a \u2013 a \u2013 a flu-type variant? Just normal fluctuations.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than Covid. The Covid variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable. But the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target have suggested that either JN1 or any of these subvariants would be reasonable strains to target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't seem overly concerned about that.",
      "I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC. and you, with the HHS secretary, in this video announcement on Tuesday, where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the Covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule. He then had a memo to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids' vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits. Then, late Thursday, the CDC said, quote, \"shared clinical decision-making,\" which I think is just talking to your doctor \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should determine whether kids get vaccinated.",
      "Can you clearly state what the policy is, because this is confusing?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, we believe the recommendation should be with the patient and their doctor. So, we're going to get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy, young Americans because we don't want to see \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For all vaccines?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We don't \u2013 well, on the Covid vaccine schedule, we don't want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth Covid booster shot. We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat infinite annual Covid vaccine.",
      "There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new Covid boosters in young, healthy kids every year in perpetuity and a \u2013 a young girl born today should get 80 Covid mRNA shots or other Covid shots in her average lifespan. We're saying that's a theory and we'd like to check in and get some randomized controlled data. It's been about four years since the original randomized trials. So, we'd like an evidence-based approach. Dr. Persad (ph) and I published this in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" last week. And we're basically saying, we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory because \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your statement was not about repeat boosters. It says, the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. The vaccine is not recommended for healthy children. That's different than annual boosters.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: We'd love to see that \u2013 that \u2013 that data. It doesn't exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, but on a practical level. For a parent at home hearing you and trying to make sense of you.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes. We're saying, take it back to your doctor.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: We're not going to push the Covid shot in young, healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it. That is a decision between a parent and their doctor. And just so you \u2013 I don't know if you know these statistics, but 80 \u2013 for 88 percent of American kids, their parents have said no to the Covid shot last season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: The worst thing \u2013 the worst thing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't go with popularity, go with, as you're saying, data. And when we look at that data \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so let's see the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the CDC data said 41 percent of children age six months to 17 years hospitalized with Covid between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. In other words, they looked healthy.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Covid was serious for them.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, we \u2013 first of all, we know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive Covid tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital.",
      "When I go to the ICU \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: When I walk to the \u2013 we know \u2013 we know that data historically, under the Biden administration, did not distinguish being sick from Covid or an incidental positive Covid test.",
      "When you go to an ICU in America and you ask, how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with Covid, I \u2013 the answer I get again and again is, we haven't seen that in a year or years. And so, with the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young healthy kids. And the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data. And you say, forget about the data, just get it anyway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, on data and transparency, for decades, since 1964, it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, that went through this panel recommendation. I mean people watched these things during Covid. The report was then handed up. It offered debate, it offered transparency and it offered data points that people could refer back to. Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet and make that data?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: That \u2013 that panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them. If you look at the minutes of the report from \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Weren't they in the (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: They \u2013 they even say, we were \u2013 generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach. But go \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why not let them do that in June?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, in the meantime, we don't want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it. They can do it. And that committee \u2013 committee will meet and make recommendations.",
      "But you look at the minutes of the last couple years, they say, we want a simple message for everybody just so they can understand it. It was not a data-based conversation. It was a conversation based on marketing and ease. And \u2013 and I've written an article titled \"why people don't trust the CDC,\" and it's in part from that blanket strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're kind of telling them not to right now. You just said, don't trust the CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in or we get some clinical data. If there's zero clinical data, you're opining. I mean you're just \u2013 it's a theory. And so, we don't want to put out an absolute recommendation for kids with no clinical data to support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women. There is data, researchers in the U.K. analyzed a series of 67 studies which included 1.8 million women. And the journal BMJ Global Health published it. People can Google it at home. And it says the Covid vaccine \"in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospital admission, and improves pregnancy outcomes, with no safety concerns.\"",
      "This is data that shows that it is recommended or could be advised for pregnant women to take the vaccine. Why do you find otherwise?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: There's no randomized controlled trial. That's the gold standard. Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a \u2013 a co-morbid condition. So, it's a very mixed bag. So, we're saying, your obstetrician, your primary care doctor and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it.",
      "Twelve percent of pregnant women last year got the Covid shot. So, people have serious concerns and it's probably because they want to see a \u2013 a randomized trial data. The randomized trial in pregnant women \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, the world moves on. And you published in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" on May 20th, in that report you referenced, you listed pregnancy as an underlying medical condition that increases a person's risk for severe Covid. You said that.",
      "So, then, seven days later, you joined in this video announcement saying you should drop the recommendation for the Covid vaccine in healthy, pregnant women. So, what changed in the seven days?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" we simply list what the \u2013 what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk. And we're \u2013 we're just saying, decide with your doctor. We're not saying one way or the other. And the randomized trial \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doctors want data and information as well from you and you're \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, here's the data on \u2013 on pregnant women. A randomized controlled trial was set up and it was closed without any explanation. We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows. We don't have those data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: I'd say, talk to their doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When do they get the data you're promising, all these controlled studies?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In the absence of data they should talk to their doctor and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no data.",

      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get straight to it.",
      "You heard from the secretary of state this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party for studying in critical fields. There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country. The U.S. government already has a heightened level of vetting. What's going to change?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. There's not enough details. But what it looks like that they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. And if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts.",
      "However, this appears to be much broader and it's terribly misguided and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory. My own father was \u2013 came here on an international student visa and I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country. And I think this is going to harm America more than help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party they shouldn't be here. Does that mean all the students \u2013 the students who were children of leaders, for example, Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful. But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong, by the way, where people are actually persecuted for various freedoms they're trying to exercise and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms.",
      "So, this is a terrible \u2013 terribly misguided policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students. Do you think that there's a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off-limits?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas, because we know that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property, or worse. But the way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious. And you have to remember that the people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party. Why? Because they want these people back. They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy.",
      "And so, we are probably helping them, as well as other countries, more than helping ourselves with this policy.",

But I think the problem is, at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners, and allies in the region and cause confusion. And so, we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements and we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.",

Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on something we were just discussing with the congressman, and that is this instruction to have new scrutiny of Chinese students. But also more broadly, Secretary Rubio said all U.S. embassies should not schedule any new student visa application appointments at this time. About 14 percent of your students are international. Are you concerned they won't be able to come back to school in September?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: I'm very concerned. Not only about Wesleyan, but about higher education in the United States.",
      "One of the great things about our system of education is that it attracts people from all over the world who want to come to America to learn. And while they're here learning, they learn about our country, our values, our freedoms. And this is really an act of intimidation to scare schools into towing the line of the current administration. It really has nothing to do with national security or with anti-Semitism. This is \u2013 this heightened scrutiny is \u2013 is meant to instill fear on college campuses, and I'm afraid it is working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is noticeable, sir, that, you know, at a time when so many higher education institutions, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, have had federal funding revoked because of their policies, we find heads of universities are fearful of speaking out. Why are you not afraid of speaking critically?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: Well, I am. I'm afraid too. But I just find it extraordinary that Americans are afraid to speak out. Especially people who, you know, run colleges and universities. Why \u2013 which \u2013 this is a free country. I've been saying it my whole life. I used to tell my parents that when I didn't want to do something. I would say, it's a free country. And this idea that we're supposed to actually conform to the ideologies in the White House, it's not just bad for Harvard or for Wesleyan, it's \u2013 it's bad for the whole country because journalists are being intimidated, law firms are being intimidated, churches, synagogues and mosques will be next. We have to defend our freedoms.",
      "And when we bring international students here, what they experience is what it's like to live in a free country. And we can't let the president change the atmosphere so that people come here and are afraid to speak out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are also some specific criticisms being lodged by members of the administration. Do you think that higher education has become too dependent on federal funding, for example, or money from foreign donors? Are there legitimate criticisms?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: There are lots of legitimate criticisms of higher education. I don't think overdependence on federal funding is the issue. Most of the federal funding you hear the press talk about are contracts to do specific kinds of research that are really great investments for the country.",
      "However, the criticisms of colleges and universities that we have, a mono culture that we don't have enough diversity, that's a criticism I've been making of my own school and the rest of higher education for years.",
      "I think we can make improvements. But the way we make improvements is not by just lining up behind a president, whoever that happens to be. We make improvements by convincing our faculty and students to broaden our perspectives, to \u2013 to welcome more political and cultural views. Not to line up and conform to the ideology of those in power.",
      "But, yes, we have work to do to clean up our own houses and we ought to get to it. But to do it under the \u2013 under this \u2013 the gun of a \u2013 of an aggressive authoritarian administration, that \u2013 that will lead to a bad outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you define some of the protests that even Wesleyan had on its campus that were, you know, critical of the state of Israel, for example, and \u2013 regarding the war against Hamas and Gaza, do you consider them to be xenophobic by definition, anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: Oh, no, not \u2013 certainly not by definition. There are lots of examples of anti-Semitism around the country. Some of them are on college campuses. They're reprehensible. When Jewish students are intimidated or afraid to practice their religion on campus or are \u2013 or are yelled at or - - it's just horrible.",
      "But at \u2013 at Wesleyan, and in many schools, the percentage of Jews protesting for Palestinians was roughly the same as the percentage of Jews on the campus generally. The \u2013 the idea that you are attacking anti- Semitism by attacking universities I think is a complete charade. It's just an excuse for getting universities to conform.",
      "We need to stamp out anti-Semitism. Those two young people just murdered because they were Jewish in Washington, that's a great example of how violence breeds violence. But the \u2013 the attack on universities is not an - - is not an attempt to defend Jews. On the contrary, I think more Jews will be hurt by these attacks than helped.",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Rand Paul said Sunday that \"the math doesn't really add up\" on the cost of President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" outlining his opposition as the legislation moves to the Senate this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said Sunday that \"the math doesn't really add up\" on the cost of President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" while outlining his opposition as the legislation moves to the Senate this week.",
      "\"I think they're asking for too much money,\" Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Paul is among a handful of Senate Republicans who have expressed opposition to the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second term agenda that addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities and which the House narrowly approved last month. The Kentucky Republican argued Sunday that with the legislation, \"there's going to be a lot of extra money\" going toward \"padding the military budget\" and additional border security when \"the President has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any legislation.\"",
      "But Paul's red line, he indicated, is on the legislation's provision that would to raise the debt ceiling. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act. Paul has advocated for removing the debt ceiling provision from the bill and voting on the issue separately.",
      "Paul said he wants to vote for the legislation and its tax components should the debt ceiling component be removed, saying \"in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.\" But for him, the debt ceiling increase is a nonstarter.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said. \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans have sought to raise the debt ceiling as part of the broader budget package because the reconciliation process that governs the bill allows them to move forward without support from across the aisle. Separating the debt ceiling component from the broader bill would mean Senate Republicans would have to negotiate with Democrats, giving them an opportunity to extract leverage despite the GOP majorities in Congress.",
      "Still, Paul argued that the Republicans who support the spending increase should be the ones responsible for voting for a debt ceiling increase, noting that Democrats have historically supported raising the debt limit as well. The Kentucky Republican has also proposed smaller increases that suspend the debt limit for a matter of months, forcing lawmakers to verify that spending cuts have been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "Mr. Trump warned Paul about opposing the legislation in a post on Truth Social Saturday, saying \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" pushed back on the bill's forecasted impact on the deficit, pointing to income from tariffs among other things that he said will improve the full picture.",
      "The treasury secretary said changes to the bill will be \"the Senate's decision,\" noting that he's been working closely with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, whom he said has been \"doing a fantastic job.\"",
      "\"Everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the House with his slim majority \u2013 he got it out, \" Bessent said. \"Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "Asked about the administration's red lines as the bill heads to the Senate, Bessent pointed to some of the president's campaign promises, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, among others, which he said would \"have to stay in.\"",
      "On the debt limit, Bessent urged that \"the United States of America is never going to default.\" But he declined to specify an X date, or the date the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills.",
      "\"That is never going to happen,\" he added. \"We are on the warning track, and we will never hit the wall.\"",

      "In a social media post after Mr. Trump's nomination announcement in December, Isaacman, 42, said NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who would help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said at the time. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible.

      "WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT MICHAEL ROTH: Good morning. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on something we were just discussing with the congressman, and that is this instruction to have new scrutiny of Chinese students, but also, more broadly, Secretary Rubio said all U.S. embassies should not schedule any new student visa application appointments at this time. About 14% of your students are international. Are you concerned they won't be able to come back to school in September?",
      "ROTH: I'm very concerned, not only about Wesleyan, but about higher education in the United States. One of the great things about our system of education is that it attracts people from all over the world who want to come to America to learn. And while they're here learning, they learn about our country, our values, our freedoms. And this is really an act of intimidation to scare schools into toeing the line of the current administration. It really has nothing to do with national security or with anti- antisemitism. This heightened scrutiny is meant to instill fear on college campuses, and I'm afraid it is working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is noticeable, sir, that you know, at a time when so many higher education institutions, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, have had federal funding revoked because of their policies, we find heads of universities are fearful of speaking out. Why are you not afraid of speaking critically?",
      "ROTH: Oh, I am. I'm afraid too. But I just find it extraordinary that Americans are afraid to speak out, especially people who, you know, run colleges, universities. Why- this is a free country. I've been saying it my whole life. I used to tell my parents that when I didn't want to do something, I would say it's a free country. And this idea that we're supposed to actually conform to the ideologies in the White House, it's not just bad for Harvard or for Wesleyan, it- it's bad for the whole country because journalists are being intimidated, law firms are being intimidated, churches, synagogues and mosques will be next. We have to defend our freedoms. And when we bring international students here, what they experience is what it's like to live in a free country, and we can't let the president change the atmosphere so that people come here and are afraid to speak out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are also some specific criticisms being lodged by members of the administration. Do you think that higher education has become too dependent on federal funding, for example, or money from foreign donors, are there legitimate criticisms?",
      "ROTH: There are lots of legitimate criticisms of higher education. I don't think overdependence on federal funding is the issue. Most of the federal funding you hear the press talk about are contracts to do specific kinds of research that are really great investments for the country. However, the criticisms of colleges and universities that we have a monoculture, that we don't have enough intellectual diversity, that's a criticism I've been making of my own school and of the rest of higher education for years. I think we can make improvements, but the way we make improvements is not by just lining up behind a president, whoever that happens to be. We make improvements by convincing our faculty and students to broaden our perspectives, to welcome more political and cultural views, not to line up and conform to the ideology of those in power. But yes, we have work to do to clean up our own houses, and we ought to get to it. But to do it under the- under this- the gun of an aggressive authoritarian administration that- that will lead to a bad outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you define some of the protests that even Wesleyan had on its campus that were, you know, critical of the State of Israel, for example, regarding the war against Hamas in Gaza, do you consider them to be xenophobic by definition, antisemitic or anti-Jewish?",
      "ROTH: Oh no, certainly not by definition. There are lots of examples of antisemitism around the country, some of them are on college campuses. They're reprehensible. When Jewish students are intimidated or afraid to practice their religion on campus, or are yelled at or- it's horrible. But at Wesleyan and in many schools, the percentage of Jews protesting for Palestinians was roughly the same as the percentage of Jews on the campus generally. The idea that you are attacking antisemitism by attacking universities, I think, is a complete charade. It's just an excuse for getting the universities to conform. We need to stamp out antisemitism. Those two young people just murdered because they were Jewish in Washington, that's a great example of how violence breeds violence. But the- the attack on universities is not an- is not an attempt to defend Jews. On the contrary, I think more Jews will be hurt by these attacks than helped.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Roth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, that's Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. He's in Illinois. Good morning to you. I want to get--",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: --Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get straight to it. You heard from the Secretary of State this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country. The U.S. government already has a heightened level of vetting. What's going to change?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. There's not enough details, but what it looks like if they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts. However, this appears to be much broader and it's terribly misguided and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory. My own father was, came here on an international student visa. And I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country. And I think this is going to harm America more than help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party they shouldn't be here. Does that mean all the, the students who are children of leaders, for example Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful. But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong by the way, where people are actually persecuted for various freedoms they're trying to exercise, and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms. So this is a terrible, terribly misguided policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students. Do you think that there is a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off limits?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas because we know that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property or worse. But the way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious and you have to remember that the people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party. Why? Because they want these people back. They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy. And so we are probably helping them, as well as other countries, more than helping ourselves with this policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Defense Secretary is traveling in Asia right now and he said in a defense forum speech that Beijing is quote \"concretely and credibly preparing to use military force.\" He said their military is rehearsing. Take a listen.",
      "PETE HEGSETH: Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. There's no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did not say what the consequences would be. Are you encouraged by what appears to be a statement of support for allies?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I am. I think what he's saying is largely correct, but I think the problem is at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners and allies in the region and cause confusion. And so we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements, and we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since you track U.S. intelligence, I wanted to ask you if you have any insight into what appears to be the swarm of Ukrainian drones that has destroyed 40 Russian military aircraft deep inside Russian territory overnight. Sources are telling our Jennifer Jacobs that the White House wasn't aware that this attack was planned. What can you tell us about the level of US intelligence sharing with Ukraine right now and helping them with their targets?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to get into classified information, but what I can say is that it's a little bit more strained in light of what Donald Trump has said recently. The one thing that I can also say is that Trump was right the other day to say that Putin is crazy in the way that he's going after civilian areas in Ukraine repeatedly, and so the Ukrainians are striking back. At the end of the day, the only way that we can bring these hostilities to an end is by strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians. Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts. That's the best way to get to some type of armistice or truce at the negotiating table sooner rather than later.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Krishnamoorthi thank you for your insights today.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Lexington, Kentucky this morning. Good morning to you.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the Treasury Secretary say a number of things, dismiss the potential price increases that could come from the tariffs when it comes to retailers. He also played down the cost of this tax and border bill that just passed through the House. Do you agree with his math?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, the math doesn't really add up. One of the things this big and beautiful bill is is it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border. It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we found so far. So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts. When you look just at the border wall, they have 46.5 billion for the border wall. Well, the current estimate from the CBP is 6.5 million per mile. So, if you did 1,000 miles, that's 6.5 billion, but they have 46 billion. So they've inflated the cost of the wall eight fold. So, there's a lot of new spending that has to be counteracted. But essentially, this is a bill by the military industrial complex advocates who are padding the military budget. There's going to be a lot of extra money. Look, the President has essentially stopped the border flow without- without new money and without any new legislation. So, I think they're asking for too much money. And in the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money, is how much debt are they going to borrow? 5 trillion over two years, an enormous amount.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That- that was the number that the Secretary was quibbling over. The President has taken note of some of your skepticism, and he did tweet yesterday saying that if you, Rand Paul, vote against his massive border and tax bill the people of Kentucky will never forgive you. Do you consider that a threat, and do you know if you have three other Republicans who will join you to block it from passage?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I had a very good conversation with the President this week about tariffs. He did most of the talking, and we don't agree exactly on the outcome. But when I come home to Kentucky, I talk to the Farm Bureau, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talked to the bourbon industry which is opposed to the tariffs. I talked to the cargo companies, UPS, DHL, all their pilots are opposed to it. I talked to the hardwood floor people. I talked to the people selling houses, building houses. I have no organized business- business interests in Kentucky for the tariffs. So I think it's worth the discussion, and it's worth people remembering that the Republicans used to be for lower taxes. Tariffs are a tax. So, if you raise taxes on the private sector, that's not good for the private sector.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, we hear from other senators who also get complaints from their people in their districts, but they're falling in line. Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction. Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling 5 trillion. So, I've told him, if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking. But I can't be- if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt. We will have lost it. The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that the leader, as you know, is sort of in a tight spot here. He needs a vehicle to raise that debt ceiling. Otherwise, you have to turn to Democrats to get that done. What was the White House response when you asked that to the President?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, historically, the debt ceiling has always gone up and will always go up, and I'm not proposing that it doesn't, but the people who should vote for it are the people who vote for the spending. Historically, all the Democrats vote for raising the debt ceiling, and about 15 big government Republicans vote for it. This will be the first time it's voted on just by Republicans. This will be the first time that Republicans own the debt. They already own the spending. In March, we continued, not me, but most Republicans voted to continue the Biden spending levels. So you remember the campaign, everybody is talking about Bidenomics and Biden inflation and Biden spending levels. Well, the Republicans all voted to keep the Biden spending levels, and that's why the deficit this year is going to be $2.2 trillion this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think this is bad politics for Republicans. Some of your Republican colleagues, like Josh Hawley, are saying that changes to Medicaid are bad politics for America's working people and for your party.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it was a bad strategy. I think the tax cuts are good for the economy. When we passed the tax cuts in 2017 the economy grew like gangbusters. We had lowest unemployment historically. It was the great achievement of Trump's first administration. They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this and not getting involved into the debt part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were with us in March, you talked about conversations you had with Elon Musk, as you know, he's just left his work with the administration. You had proposed a rescission request, a claw back about $500 billion of money Congress had already signed off on. We know now that the White House is going to ask Congress this week for some rescissions. Sounds like it's just $9.4 billion and it's- it's PBS, it's NPR and it's foreign aid. Is this really the best strategy? And do you think 51 Republican senators are on board with it?",
      "SEN. PAUL: First of all, I will vote for spending cuts. The more the better. This is very, very small to put it in perspective, if the deficit this year is 2.2 trillion, if you cut 9 billion, the deficit is going to be 2.191 trillion. It really doesn't materially change the course of the country. We should do it by all means. And it is the low hanging fruit. This is the money that was pointed out that was being spent for sex change operations in Guatemala, trans-opera in Columbia, all this crazy spending. Yes, it should be cut--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Sesame Street.--",
      "SEN. PAUL: -- I had an amendment about a month- Excuse me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sesame Street. It's PBS and NPR.",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yeah. And I think, yeah- you're right. We'll see if there's the votes to cut it. I don't think we necessarily need government programming anymore. We have so many choices on the internet and so many choices on television, but my preference has always been, in the past, to cut a little bit of everything, rather than cut a lot of something. So what I've done in the past is propose a penny plan budget where we cut a certain percentage of everything, but it includes entitlements, or it doesn't really work. Once you exclude the entitlements, there isn't enough money to cut so you can never achieve balance by not looking at the entitlements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The budget director on another program this morning said they may not need to use this rescission, this claw back, because the White House has other tools. Do you think they need to go through Congress? Is this overstepping?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, they- well, they absolutely have to use a recession- the rescission, and it is done by simple majority, by Republicans only. There is no filibuster of it. So, it's a great tool to cut spending. If they don't use, it will be a huge wasted opportunity. But I will tell you, they tried in the first Trump administration. It wasn't their fault. They sent a tiny one, 16 billion, and it failed because two Republicans went the other way. So, we'll see what happens on this. But if we can't even cut welfare that we're giving to other countries, if we can't cut foreign aid welfare, I feel bad for the country. You know, interest rates are rising. We're having trouble selling our debt. We've got a lot of problems.",

      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to. I want to start with China, because the Defense Secretary just said there's an imminent military threat from China to Taiwan. Days earlier, Secretary Rubio said he'd aggressively revoked Chinese student visas. On top of that, you have curbing exports to China. Trade talks you said with Beijing are stalled, and President Trump just accused China of violating an agreement, and now says no more, 'Mr. Nice Guy.' Are you intentionally escalating this standoff with Beijing?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I don't think it's intentional. I- I think that what Secretary Hegseth did was remind everyone that during COVID, China was an unreliable partner, and what we are trying to do is to de-risk. We do not want to decouple Margaret, but we do need to de-risk, as we saw during COVID, whether it was with semiconductors, medicines, the other products we are in the process of de-risking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Making the United States less reliant on China, but at the same--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --Well, and the whole world. The whole world, because what China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe, and that is not what a reliable partner does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is that like- what specifically is President Trump saying when he says they are violating an agreement? Because it was the one you negotiated in Geneva earlier this month. And what's the consequence for that?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, we will see what the consequences are. I am confident that when President Trump and party Chairman Xi have a call, that this will be ironed out. So- but the fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement- maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it's intentional. We'll see after the President speaks with party chairman.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's critical minerals, rare earths. Is that what you're talking about?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the President has said a few times that he was going to speak to President Xi, but he hasn't since before the inauguration. Beijing keeps denying that there was any contact. Do you have anything scheduled?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I believe we'll see something very soon, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a conversation with your counterpart or Lutnick with his counterpart at the commerce level?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I think we're going to let the two principles have a conversation, and then everything will stem from that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, spoke this week at an economic forum, and he gave this read on Beijing.",
      "[SOT]",
      "JAMIE DIMON: I just got back from China last week. They're not scared, folks. This notion they're gonna come bow to America. I wouldn't count on that. And when they have a problem, they put 100,000 engineers on it, and they've been preparing for this for years.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you underestimated the Chinese state's backbone here?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Again, Margaret, I hope it doesn't come to that. And Jamie is a great banker. I know him well, but I would vociferously disagree with that assessment, that the laws of economics and gravity apply to the Chinese economy and the Chinese system, just like everyone else.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were last here in March, we were trying to gauge what the impact of the standoff with China and with the tariffs on the rest of the world would do for American consumers here at home. At that time, you told us you were going to appoint an affordability czar and council to figure out five, you said, or eight areas where there will be some pain for working class Americans. Where are you anticipating price increases?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, thus far- we wanted to make sure that there aren't price increases, Margaret. And thus far there have been no price increases. Everything has been alarmist, that the inflation numbers are actually dropping. We saw the first drop of inflation in four years. The inflation numbers last week, they were very- the- pro-consumer. We've--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you listen to earnings calls just like we do. You know what Walmart's saying, what Best Buy's saying and what Target are saying of what's coming--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: But Margaret, I also know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying. I know what the South China Morning Post wrote within the past 24 hours that 65%- 65%- the- of the tariffs will likely be eaten by the Chinese producers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are there five or eight areas that you have identified, as you said back in March, where American consumers will be able to have lower prices, or should be warned of higher prices?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, a lot of it's already working its way through the system. So we've seen a substantial decrease in gasoline and energy prices. So that's down 20% year over year. We've seen the food prices go down, these notorious egg prices. Through the good work of President Trump and Secretary Rollins, egg prices have collapsed. So we're seeing more and more. And what we want to do- the- is even that out across the all sections of the economy. So inflation has been very tame. Consumer earnings were up 0.8% last month, which is a gigantic increase for one month. So real earnings minus low inflation is great for the American people, and that's what we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, because when you met with the Chinese earlier this month and you went down from the 145% tariff down to about- it's like 30%. 30%'s not nothing, that tax on goods coming in here. Retailers are warning of price hikes--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you go back to school shopping, things are going to cost more.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: But Margaret, some are and some aren't. Home Depot and Amazon said they're not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Home Depot and Amazon aren't where you go for your back school shopping, when you buy your jeans, when you buy your crayons, and you buy all those things that parents--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I don't know about you, but I do it online at Amazon. This isn't an advertisement for Amazon. And guess where most of the Halloween costumes in America get bought? At Home Depot. So that's just not right. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers. And I was in the investment business for 35 years, Margaret, and I will tell you earnings calls- they have to give the worst case scenario, because if it- if they haven't and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not always the worst case. It's the most probable case--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --No, no, no--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: as well--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --No, no, no. No, they have to give the worst case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Walmart- there was just a piece published with the conservative strategist Karl Rove. I'm not asking about politics, because he is a political strategist, but he went in on the math here. And he points out that Walmart has a profit margin of less than 3%. He says, 'If it does what Mr. Trump says, eat the tariffs, it can't break even. It can't absorb the cost of an imported pair of kids jeans with a 46% tariff on Vietnam, a 37% tariff for Bangladesh, or 32% tariff on sneakers from Indonesia. Other companies are in the same pickle.' So should companies cut back on the amount of goods they have on their shelves or just on their profitability?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: That- that's a decision company by- by company, Margaret. And I had a long discussion with Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart, and they're going to do what's right for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But for consumers, the reality is there will either be less inventory or things at higher prices, or both.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, when we were here in March, you said there was going to be big inflation. There hasn't been any inflation. Actually, the inflation numbers are the best in four years. So why don't we stop trying to say this could happen, and wait and see what does happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just trying to gauge for people planning ahead here, one of the things the President said on Friday is that he's going to double the tariffs on steel and aluminum up to 50%, effective June 4. How much will that impact the construction industry?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I think- I was with the president at the U.S. Steel Plant in Pittsburgh on Friday, and I will tell you that the President has the- reignited the steel industry here in America. And back to the earlier statements on national security. There are national security priorities here for having a strong steel industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the construction industry, for example?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the steel industry, and you know, again, we- we'll see there are a lot of elasticities that- you know this is a very complicated ecosystem. So is it going to impact the construction industry, maybe. But it's going to impact the steel industry, the- in a great way. The steel workers, again, were left on the side of the road after the China shock, and now they're back that the- they are Trump supporters. And when I tell you that it was magic in the arena, or it was actually at the steel plant that night, that these hard working Americans know their jobs are secure, there's going to be capital investment, and the number of jobs is going to be grown around the country, whether it's in Pittsburgh, whether it's in Arkansas, whether it's in Alabama.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this big tax bill that worked through the House, is going to the Senate next. In it is increase or suspension to the debt limit that you need delivered on by mid-July. How close of a brush with default could this be, given how massive some of the Senate changes are expected to be to the other parts of the bill?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, first of all, Margaret, I will say the United States of America is never going to default. That is never going to happen. That- we are on the warning track and we will never hit the wall.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have more wiggle room if they don't deliver this by mid-July? I mean, how hard of a date is this?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: That- we don't give out the X date because we use that to move the bill forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes deadlines help force action, as you know, particularly in this town, sir, that's why I'm asking. The President did say he- he expects pretty significant changes to this bill, though, so that affects the timing of it moving. What would you like Republican lawmakers to keep? What would you like them to alter?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Again, that's going to be the Senate's decision. Leader Thune, who I've worked closely with during this process, has been doing a fantastic job. And Margaret, I'll point out, everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the house with his slim majority. He got it out Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --There's no red lines for you in there of just don't touch this you can, you know, tinker with that.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I- I think that they're not necessarily my red lines. The President has the- his campaign promises that he wants to fulfill for working Americans. So no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans for American made automobiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those have to stay in.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Those have to stay in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: JP Morgan's Dimon also predicted a debt market crisis. 'Cracks in the bond market' was what he said. You are considering easing some regulations, you've said, for the big banks. How do you avoid that bond market crisis he's predicting, spreading and really causing concern, particularly with all of the worries about American debt right now?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: So again, I've known Jamie a long time and for his entire career he's made predictions like this. Fortunately, none of them have come true. That's why he's a banker- a great banker. He tries to look around the corner. One of the reasons I'm sitting here talking to you today and not at home watching your show is that I was concerned about the level of debt. So the deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last year, and in two years it will be lower again. We are going to bring the deficit down slowly. We didn't get here in one year. We didn't get here in one year, and this has been a long process. So the goal is to bring it down over the next four years, leave the country in great shape in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that the Speaker of the House estimates this is going to add four to five trillion dollars over the next 10 years, and there's that debt limit increase.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well again, Margaret, that's CBO scoring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Speaker of the House.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it last Sunday on this program.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The- he said that's the CBO scoring. Let me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --No, he said that sounds right.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Let me tell you what's not included in there, what can't be scored. So we're taking in substantial tariff income right now, so that there are estimates that that could be another 2 trillion that we are the- pushing through savings. So you know my estimate is that could be up to another 100 billion a year. So over the 10 year window, that could be a trillion. President has a prescription drug plan with the pharmaceutical companies that could substantially push down costs for prescription drugs, and that could be another trillion. So there's the four.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary. Good morning.",
      "FDA COMMISSIONER DR. MARTY MAKARY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person.",
      "DR. MAKARY: Good to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to get through a lot here, but one of the things we've noticed is this new COVID variant that seems to be circulating in Asia. I believe it's NB.1.8.1. It's a variant under monitoring. What do we need to know?",
      "DR. MAKARY: Yeah so this appears to be a subvariant of JN.1, which has been the dominant strain so it's believed that there is cross-immunity protection. The COVID- COVID virus is going to continue to mutate, and it's behaving like a common cold virus. It's now going to become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal, that causes about 25% of the cases of the common cold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're thinking of it as like a flu-type variant, just a normal fluctuation.",
      "DR. MAKARY: The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than COVID. The COVID variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable, but the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target, have suggested that either JN.1 or any of these subvariants would be reasonable strains to target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't seem overly concerned about that. I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC and you with the HHS Secretary in this video announcement on Tuesday where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule. He then had a memo to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids' vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits. Then late Thursday, the CDC said quote \"shared clinical decision-making,\" which I think is just talking to your doctor should determine whether kids get vaccinated. Can you clearly state what the policy is? Because this is confusing.",
      "DR. MAKARY: Yeah, we believe the recommendation should be with a patient and their doctor. So we're going to get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy, young Americans because we don't want to see--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For all vaccines?",
      "DR. MAKARY: We don't- well on the COVID vaccine schedule, we don't want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth COVID booster shot. We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat, infinite, annual COVID vaccine. There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new COVID boosters in young, healthy kids every year in perpetuity, and a young girl born today should get 80 COVID mRNA shots, or other COVID shots in her average lifespan. We're saying that's a theory, and we'd like to check in and get some randomized, controlled data. It's been about four years since the original randomized trials, so we'd like an evidence based approach. Dr. Prasad and I published this in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, and we're basically saying we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory, because--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your statement was not about repeat boosters. It says the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, the vaccine is not recommended for healthy children. That's different than annual boosters.",
      "DR. MAKARY: Yeah at this point we're dealing, you know, it is a booster strategy- people would be getting the updated shot. So whether or not a young, healthy--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about kids who haven't gotten a shot?",
      "DR. MAKARY: So we'd like to see the data. We'd love to see that- that data. It doesn't exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, but on a practical level, for a parent at home, hearing you, trying to make sense here.",
      "DR. MAKARY: Yeah. We're saying, take it back to your doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Their child has not been vaccinated. Are you recommending that their first encounter with COVID be an actual infection?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "DR. MAKARY: We're not going to push the COVID shot in young, healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it. That is a decision between a parent and their doctor. And just so, I don't know if you know the statistics, but 80 for 88% of American kids, their parents, have said no to the COVID shot last season. So America, the vast majority Americans, are saying no. Maybe they want to see some clinical data as well. Maybe they have concerns about the safety--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I don't want to crowdsource my health guidance. I want a clear thing--",
      "DR. MAKARY: The worst thing you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I wouldn't go with popularity--",
      "DR. MAKARY: The worst thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I'm going with, as you're saying, data--",
      "DR. MAKARY: --Yeah so let's see the data.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So the CDC data said 41% of children aged six months to 17 years hospitalized with COVID between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. In other words, they looked healthy--",
      "DR. MAKARY: So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and COVID was serious for them.",
      "DR. MAKARY: So first of all, we know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive COVID tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't trust the CDC data?",
      "DR. MAKARY: --When I go to the ICU, when I walk to the P- the we know, We know that data, historically under the Biden administration, did not distinguish being sick from COVID or an incidental positive COVID test. When you go to an ICU in America and you ask, how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with COVID, the answer I get again and again is, we haven't seen that in a year or years. And so the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young, healthy kids. And the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data. And you say, Forget about the data. Just get it anyway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so on data and transparency for decades, since 1964 it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP that went through this panel recommendation. People watched these things during COVID. The report was then handed up. It offered debate, it offered transparency, and it offered data points that people could refer back to. Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet and meet that data?",
      "DR. MAKARY: That panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them. If you look at the minutes of the report from, they even say we were- generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why not let them do that in June?",
      "DR. MAKARY: So in the meantime, we don't want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it. They can do it, and that committee-committee will meet and make recommendations. But you look at the minutes of the last couple of years, they say we want a simple message for everybody, just so they can understand it. It was not a data based conversation. It was a conversation based on marketing and ease and and I've written an article titled \"Why the people don't trust the CDC,\" and it's in part from that blanket strategy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're telling them not to right now. You just said don't trust the CDC.",
      "DR. MAKARY:\u00a0 We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in, or we get some clinical data. If there's zero clinical data, you're opining. I mean, you're just, it's a theory, and so we don't want to put out an absolute recommendation for kids with no clinical data at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women. There is data. Researchers in the UK analyzed a series of 67 studies, which included 1.8 million women, and the journal BMJ Global Health published it. People can Google it at home, and it says the COVID vaccine in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission and improves pregnancy outcomes with no serious safety concerns. This is data that shows that it is recommended or could be advised, for pregnant women to take this vaccine. Why do you find otherwise?",
      "DR. MAKARY: There's no randomized control trial. That's the gold standard. Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a comorbid condition. So it's a very mixed bag. So we're saying your obstetrician, your primary care doctor, and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it. 12% of pregnant women last year got the COVID shot. So people have serious concerns, and it's probably because they want to see a randomized trial data, the randomized trial of pregnant women\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, the world moves on, and you published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 20. In that report, you referenced, you listed pregnancy as an underlying medical condition that increases a person's risk for severe COVID. You said that. So then seven days later, you joined in this video announcement saying you should drop the recommendation for the COVID vaccine in healthy pregnant women. So what changed in the seven days?",
      "DR. MAKARY: In the New England Journal medicine, we simply list what the f- what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk, and we're just saying, decide with your doctor. We're not saying the other\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doctors want data and information as well from you\u2013",
      "DR. MAKARY: and the randomized trial\u2013 so here's the data on pregnant women. A randomized control trial was set up, and it was closed without any explanation. We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows. We don't have those data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say--",
      "DR. MAKARY: I'd say talk to their doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When do they get the data you're promising? All these controlled studies.",
      "DR. MAKARY: In the absence of data, they should talk to their doctor--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no date?",
      "DR. MAKARY: --and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgment.",

      "\"We've never seen anything like this before in my lifetime \u2013 somebody that says, 'Whatever I want should be the law of the land. It's my way or the highway.' And most Americans don't agree with that,\" Clinton said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"But I like to think that he's paid a price for this, you know, name-calling and throwing his weight around \u2026 I think it's made him less popular.\"",
      "He said opposition to Mr. Trump would be bolstered if Democrats win governors' races at play this year, and win back the House in 2026.",

I think that him shutting law firms out of representing their clients before federal agencies and in federal buildings, because he doesn't agree with their position \u2013 that ain't America. We've never done that. The whole purpose of having a legal system is to have both sides be heard.\"",
      "Clinton said that, so far, the courts are stopping the president, \"including a lot of judges he appointed. And you know, he is looking for ways to basically defy all these court orders. But I think he'll have a hard time doing that. And if he does, I think it will hurt him in America.\"",

I just think that most people don't have any idea \u2013 most people who are criticizing the Democrats right now \u2013 have no idea how difficult it is to decide the right thing to do.

      "\"That will come. Elections will happen. And we will see.",

But someone needs to stand up and say, 'Damn it, what we have in common matters more. We cannot throw the legacy of this country away. We cannot destroy other people's trust in us. We need to preserve that and find a way to work together, and not humiliate other people just so we can win.' We gotta just calm down and try to pull people together again. That's what I think.\"",
      "Elder statesmen",
      "Last November, Clinton released his book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House,\" and talked with \"Sunday Morning\" about the importance of citizens to \"stand up for what we think is right.\"",
      "The following month, Clinton, then 78, had a health scare that landed him in the hospital. \"It turned out to be no big deal,\" he said. \"I basically kind of lost my balance, and I knew I was sick, and I went to the hospital and checked in and they said I was severely dehydrated.

The only concern I thought he had to deal with was, could anybody do that job until they were 86?\" Clinton said. \"And we'd had several long talks. I had never seen him and walked away thinking, He can't do this anymore. He was always on top of his briefs.",

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

    "summary": "As the Department of Government Efficiency leader steps away from the White House, Elon Musk talks with \"Sunday Morning\" about why he believes Trump's proposed budget clashes with his team's efforts to slash the functions of government.",
    "story": [
      "In the beginning, Donald Trump and Elon Musk got along great. \"He is a truly incredible guy,\" Trump said at a campaign rally last October, \"and I don't say that that often.\"",
      "Musk spent $288 million to elect Trump and his allies.",
      "The president invited Musk into the Oval Office and Cabinet meetings. Musk called himself \"first buddy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed Musk's idea to create a Department of Government Efficiency. [\"You gotta give him credit!\" the president told reporters.] \u00a0Musk demonstrated his goals for DOGE by wielding a chainsaw at a February meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!\" he bellowed.",
      "In four months, DOGE took the chainsaw to every federal department: 250,000 workers were fired or bought out; Musk even slashed grants and staffing at environmental agencies, like the EPA and NOAA, after decades of warning about the risks of climate change.",
      "But Musk did not enjoy the pushback. There were acts of violence; death threats; lawsuits; mandatory re-hirings; and shouting matches with Cabinet members.",
      "Tesla profits plummeted by 71%\u2014and Musk's net worth dropped by $100 billion.",
      "Last month, Musk finally left Washington, but still intended to work on DOGE a day or two a week. And this past Tuesday, he offered \"Sunday Morning\" an interview at SpaceX's headquarters near Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas.",
      "\"It's a bit unfair\"",
      "We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw a huge bust of Musk, installed by his admirers\u2014and vandalized by his critics.",
      "But the interview didn't get off to a smooth start.",
      "I asked, \"I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this?\"",
      "\"You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit,\" Musk replied.",
      "\"I'm wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. I mean, you were one of those kids, right?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I mean, I think we wanna stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy,\" Musk said.",
      "\"Oh, okay,\" I said. \"I was told anything is good, but\u2026\"",
      "\"No, well\u2014no,\" Musk replied.",
      "But Musk was\u00a0willing to talk about the DOGE firestorm. I asked him, \"You've spoken about how much of a grind and a stress it was on you, and you know, Tesla's reputation took a hit, your reputation took a hit. People are very upset about [effects on] Social Security, and national parks, and air traffic, and food safety, and cancer research, Alzheimer's research. Now that you've had a chance to look at it, might there have been a different approach?\"",
      "Musk said, \"Yeah, I think \u2026 what was starting to happen was that, like, it's a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything. So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I've had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue.\"",
      "Musk calls for U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad",
      "Musk calls for U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad",
      "I asked, \"I was just thinking about the, you know, 'move fast and break things,' you know, before you really understand what the agency does?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, I guess part of it is, like, is it depends on where you're coming from,\" Musk said. \"I'm like a proponent of smaller government, not bigger government. So, now if somebody's a proponent of, you know, more government programs and bigger government, and they see, 'Hey, DOGE is cutting all these government programs,' then they'll be fundamentally opposed to that because they just think the government should do more things. That's just a fundamental, I guess, ideological opinion.",
      "\"But my frank opinion of the government is that, like, the government is just, like, the DMV that got big, okay? So, when you say it like, 'Let's have the government do something,' you should think, 'Do you want the DMV to do it?'\"",
      "And then, Musk started talking about the Trump administration, without even being asked about Trump. \"And you know, it's not like I agree with everything the administration does,\" said Musk. \"So it's like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don't entirely agree with. But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. So then, I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything this administration's doing.\"",
      "On the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\"",
      "In Washington, federal workers say that DOGE has left the government's operations in disarray. And worst of all, it might have all been for nothing. Musk claims to have saved the government $175 billion so far (nowhere close to his original target of $2 trillion, or even his revised\u00a0target of $1 trillion).",
      "And that\u00a0was before the president's new spending bill passed the House. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the president's proposed budget will add $3.8 trillion to our debt over the next ten years. It's now being debated in the Senate.",
      "Musk said, \"I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn't decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "I said, \"I actually thought that, when this 'big, beautiful bill' came along, it'd be like, everything he's done on DOGE gets wiped out in the first year.\"",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk laughed. \"But I don't know if it could be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "And here is where the story gets a little complicated.",
      "On Tuesday, right after our interview, CBS News released a clip of it to promote this very report. It was that part, where Musk criticizes Trump's spending bill, and his remarks became news. It went all the way to the White House, where the president was asked about Musk's criticism of the bill. Within 24 hours, Musk announced that his time in the Trump administration was officially over. Out of DOGE, out of government.",
      "Musk said that the reason was that his limited 130-day stint as advisor was ending. But until that moment, he'd been saying that he still intended to work on DOGE part-time. \"Well, DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,\" he told us. \"I will have some participation in that, but as I've said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.\"",
      "Truth is, the Trump-Musk relationship had already seemed to be cooling. The president used to post about Musk about six times a week. But by April, he'd stopped mentioning Musk altogether.",
      "Still, on Friday, they held a media event at the White House to confirm their mutual admiration\u2014and to leave the door open for future collaboration. \"Elon's really not leaving,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's gonna be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.\"",
      "Musk added, \"The DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They're going to continue doing an incredible job, and I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president.\"",
      "Musk might be the first to admit that his DOGE experiment gave him a black eye\u2014like the actual black eye he had on Friday, which he says he got from his five-year-old son \u2026 or the matching one on that statue.",
      "At least for now, Musk says that his focus will be running his business ventures: Tesla, Starlink, X, xAI, Neuralink, Optimus robots, the Boring Company, and SpaceX.",
      "I asked, \"Are all of your businesses related in some way?\"",
      "\"I guess you can think of the businesses as things that improve the probable trajectory of civilization,\" Musk replied. \"So you know, for making life multi-planetary or extending life to Mars, the idea there is to ensure the long-term survival of life and consciousness as we know it.\"",
      "After our interview Tuesday, we were invited to witness the ninth launch of his Starship, the biggest rocket ever built. The two previous Starship tests ended in explosions \u2013 or, as SpaceX puts it, \"rapid unscheduled disassemblies.\" So, all eyes were on Test Launch 9 to see if a Starship could return to Earth in one piece.",
      "As Musk left our interview to watch the launch, he said something that could sum up all his enterprises: \"I can't guarantee success, but I can guarantee excitement.\"",
      "In the end, Elon Musk's giant rocket spun out of control. It did not survive re-entry.",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. astronomers hunting for \"Planet Nine\" have instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches.",
    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",
      "But what is in our \"backyard\" still largely remains unknown, he added.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",
      "\"Record temperatures immediately become the new normal,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.",

    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",

What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",

Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",

    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",

Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims during a march in support of Israeli hostages, according to an FBI official. Boulder police say eight people were injured.",
      "The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling \"free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence\" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, multiple sources told CBS News. That original visa expired in Feb. 2023, the sources said. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.",
      "The FBI said later Sunday night it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder\" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.",
      "A walk to remember the\u00a0Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza\u00a0was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled \"End Zionist!\" during the attack.",
      "The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be \"safe to say\" that person was in critical condition.",
      "Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.",
      "The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.",
      "UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.",
      "As a result of the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents were at the scene.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, \"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked \"simply because they were Jews\" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute \"the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "\"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" Polis said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Run For Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, \"This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.\" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.",
      "Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages\u00a0each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.",
      "Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.",
      "\"So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,\" said Victor.",
      "Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.",
      "\"I saw the aftermath,\" said street performer Peter Irish. \"It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.\"",
      "University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, \"My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.\"",
      "A joint statement from Boulder's Jewish community said:",
      "We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.",
      "We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.",
      "Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.",
      "We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.",
      "We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.",
      "Strength to you all.",
      "Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon.",
      "My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.",
      "From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.",
      "People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts\u2014which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home\u2014must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.",

      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not, When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",

      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",

      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",

      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Trump.",

      "There have been no structure fires in the city located nearly 400 miles northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg as of Sunday, but officials worry that a change in wind direction could bring the fire into town.",
      "Ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees are stretched thin, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said. Smoke was also worsening air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some U.S. states along the border.",
      "\"Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour,\" Saskatchewan's Public Safety Agency warned Sunday. \"As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.\"",

      "Thousands have also been affected by wildfires in Saskatchewan and Alberta, with 1,300 people in the community of Swan Hills northwest of Edmonton forced from their homes.",

      "\"The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north,\" Moe said.",
      "As of Sunday afternoon, more than 170 active fires were burning across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Of those, 89 were considering to be burning \"out of control.\"",
      "Smoke from the wildfires was expected to drift down into the U.S., with air quality alerts issued for portions of the Upper Midwest.",
      "\"Smoke from Canadian wildfires continue to spread across the skies across much of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes,\" the National Weather Service wrote. \"\u2026The smoke will also create air quality issues at times, mainly for sensitive groups.\"",

      "Winnipeg has opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, business people and convention-goers.",
      "Manitoba's Indigenous leaders, including Monias, told a news conference on Saturday that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees are arriving are full, and they called on the government to direct hotel owners to give evacuees priority.",
      "Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s.",
      "\"It's really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired,\" Wilson said at the news conference.",
      "\"We need to make sure that we have space for our people.\"",
      "The fire menacing Flin Flon began Monday near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion.",
      "The 1,200 or so residents of Creighton have also been ordered out, many of whom have gone to nearby Nipawin, Saskatchewan. In total, more than 8,000 people have fled wildfires in Saskatchewan.",

      "Washington \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation, after Mr. Trump said China was violating its trade agreement with the U.S. late last week.",
      "Of a call between the two leaders, \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said in April that he spoke to his Chinese counterpart about tariffs, but Beijing denied that a direct conversation took place. Mr. Trump has vowed since he took office in January to speak with Xi, but no formal plans have been announced.",
      "Weeks after the U.S. and China agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs imposed on imports earlier in the year, Mr. Trump said Friday that China was violating the trade agreement, though he didn't outline the alleged violations.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social Friday, before adding that \"China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Last month, the U.S. and China committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies that had been imposed since early April, reducing the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to about 30%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller outlined to reporters Friday that China had \"abrogated the agreement.\"",
      "\"China did not fulfill the obligations that it made and committed to with the United States. And so that opens up all manner of action for the United States to ensure future compliance,\" Miller said. \"It remains the President's hope and desire that China will choose the path of cooperation, of common ground, and that we can open up China to American business just in the same way that America, of course, that we all know has been open to Chinese business for a very long time now.\"",
      "Miller said the U.S. wants to see China comply with the agreement and fulfill its obligations \"as soon as possible\" to ensure a \"cooperative\" and \"constructive\" relationship that he said the president wants.",
      "On Sunday, Bessent acknowledged that the products China is withholding include critical minerals, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. The export of rare earths was thought to be at the center of the disagreement.",
      "\"The fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement \u2014 maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it's intentional,\" Bessent said. \"We'll see after the president speaks with party chairman.\"",
      "The trade dispute comes amid other developments between the U.S. and China. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined in recent days a developing military threat from China to Taiwan. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration would work to \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of some Chinese international students. Asked whether the administration was intentionally escalating a standoff with Beijing, Bessent said \"I don't think it's intentional.\"",
      "\"I think that what Secretary Hegseth did was remind everyone that during COVID, China was an unreliable partner, and what we are trying to do is to de-risk,\" Bessent said, while adding that the U.S. doesn't want to \"decouple.\"",
      "Bessent said \"what China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe.\"",
      "\"That is not what a reliable partner does,\" he added.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are there five or eight areas that you have identified, as you said back in March, where American consumers will be able to have lower prices, or should be warned of higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a lot of it's already working its way through the system. So we've seen a substantial decrease in gasoline and energy prices. So that's down 20 percent year over year.",
      "We've seen the food prices go down, these notorious egg prices. Through the good work of President Trump and Secretary Rollins, egg prices have collapsed. So we're seeing more and more. And what we want to do, the \u2013 is even that out across the \u2013 all sections of the economy.",
      "So, inflation has been very tame. Consumer earnings were up 0.8 percent last month, which is a gigantic increase for one month. So, real earnings minus low inflation is great for the American people, and that's what we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, because when you met with the Chinese earlier this month, and you went down from the 145 percent tariff down to about \u2013 it's like 30 percent; 30 percent's not nothing, that tax on goods coming in here.",

Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.",
      "And I was in the investment business for 35 years, Margaret, and I will tell you earnings calls, they have to give the worst-case scenario, because if it \u2013 if they haven't and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.",

      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think \u2013 I was with the president at the U.S. Steel plant in Pittsburgh on Friday, and I will tell you that the president has the \u2013 reignited the steel industry here in America.",
      "And back to the earlier statements on national security, there are national security priorities here for having a strong steel industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the construction industry, for example?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I \u2013 I have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the steel industry.",
      "And, you know, we \u2013 again, we'll see. There are a lot of elasticities that \u2013 you know, this is a very complicated ecosystem. So is it going to impact the construction industry? Maybe. But it's going to impact the steel industry the \u2013 in a great way. The steelworkers, again, were left on the side of the road after the China shock, and now they're back, that the \u2013 they are Trump supporters.",
      "And when I tell you that it was magic in the arena, or it was actually at the steel plant that night, that these hardworking Americans know their jobs are secure\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 there's going to be capital investment, and the number of jobs is going to be grown around the country, whether it's in Pittsburgh, whether it's in Arkansas, whether it's in Alabama.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this big tax bill that worked through the House, is going to the Senate next.",
      "In it is an increase or suspension to the debt limit that you need delivered on by mid-July. How close of a brush with default could this be, given how massive some of the Senate changes are expected to be to the other parts of the bill?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first of all, Margaret, I will say the United States of America is never going to default. That is never going to happen, that we are on the warning track and we will never hit the wall.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have more wiggle room if they don't deliver this by mid-July? I mean, how hard of a date is this?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The \u2013 we don't give out the X-date, because we use that to move the bill forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes, deadlines help force action, as you know, particularly in this town, sir. That's why I'm asking.",
      "The president did say he \u2013 he expects pretty significant changes to this bill, though, so that affects the timing of it moving. What would you like Republican lawmakers to keep? What would you like them to alter?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Again, that's going to be the Senate's decision. Leader Thune, who I have worked closely with during this process, has been doing a fantastic job.",
      "And, Margaret, I will point out, everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the House with his slim majority. He got it out. Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership. So, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no red lines for you in there of just don't touch this, you can, you know, tinker with that?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I \u2013 I think that they're not necessarily my red lines.",
      "The president has the \u2013 his campaign promises that he wants to fulfill for working Americans, so no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans for American-made automobiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those have to stay in, is what you're saying.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Those have to stay in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: J.P. Morgan's Dimon also predicted a debt market crisis. Cracks in the bond market' was what he said.",
      "You are considering easing some regulations, you've said, for the big banks. How do you avoid that bond market crisis he's predicting spreading and really causing concern, particularly with all of the worries about American debt right now?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, again, I have known Jamie a long time. And for his entire career, he's made predictions like this. Fortunately, none of them have come true. That's why he's a banker, a great banker. He tries to look around the corner.",
      "One of the reasons I'm sitting here talking to you today and not at home watching your show is that I was concerned about the level of debt. So the deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last year, and in two years it will be lower again. We are going to bring the deficit down slowly.",
      "We didn't get here in one year. We didn't get here in one year, and this has been a long process. So the goal is to bring it down over the next four years, leave the country in great shape in 2028.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the speaker of the House.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it last Sunday on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The \u2013 he said that's the CBO scoring. Let me\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, he said that sounds right.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Let me tell you what's not included in there, what can't be scored.",
      "So we're taking in substantial tariff income right now, so there are estimates that that could be another $2 trillion that we are the \u2013 pushing through savings. So you know my estimate is, that could be up to another $100 billion a year. So, over the 10-year window, that could be a trillion.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Lexington, Kentucky, this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the treasury secretary say a number of things, dismissed the potential price increases that could come from the tariffs when it comes to retailers. He also played down the cost of this tax and border bill that just passed through the House.",
      "Do you agree with his math?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, the math doesn't really add up.",
      "One of the things this big and beautiful bill is, is, it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border. It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we have found so far. So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts.",
      "When you look just at the border wall, they have $46.5 billion for the border wall. Well, the current estimate from the CBP is $6.5 million per mile. So if you did 1,000 miles, that's $6.5 billion, but they have $46 billion. So they have inflated the cost of the wall eightfold.",
      "So there's a lot of new spending that has to be counteracted. But, essentially, this is a bill by the military industrial complex advocates who are padding the military budget. There's going to be a lot of extra money.",
      "Look, the president has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any new legislation. So I think they're asking for too much money. And, in the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money is, how much debt are they going to borrow?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Five trillion over two years, enormous amount.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That was the number that the secretary was quibbling over.",
      "The president has taken note of some of your skepticism, and he did tweet yesterday, saying that if you, Rand Paul, vote against his massive border and tax bill, the people of Kentucky will never forgive you.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you consider that a threat? And do you know if you have three other Republicans who will join you to block it from passage?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I had a very good conversation with the president this week about tariffs. He did most of the talking, and we don't agree exactly on the outcome.",
      "But when I come home to Kentucky, I talk to the Farm Bureau, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the bourbon industry, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the cargo companies, UPS, DHL. All of their pilots are opposed to it. I talk to the hardwood floor people. I talk to the people selling houses, building houses.",
      "I have no organized business \u2013 business interest in Kentucky for the tariffs. So I think it's worth the discussion, and it's worth people remembering that the Republicans used to be for lower taxes. Tariffs are a tax.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, if you raise taxes on the private sector, that's not good for the private sector.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we hear from other senators who also get complaints from their \u2013 people in their districts, but they're falling in line. Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction.",
      "Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent. But, at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So I have told them, if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I can't be \u2013 if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt? We will have lost.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader, as you know, is sort of in a tight spot here. He needs a vehicle to raise that debt ceiling. Otherwise, you had to turn to Democrats to get that done.",
      "What was the White House response when you asked that to the president?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, historically, the debt ceiling has always gone up and will always go up, and I'm not proposing that it doesn't. But the people who should vote for it are the people who vote for the spending.",
      "Historically, all the Democrats vote for raising the debt ceiling, and about 15 big government Republicans vote for it. This will be the first time it's voted on just by Republicans. This will be the first time that Republicans own the debt. They already own the spending.",
      "In March, we continued, not me, but most Republicans voted to continue the Biden spending levels. So, you will remember the campaign. Everybody was talking about Bidenomics and Biden inflation and Biden spending levels. Well, the Republicans all voted to keep the Biden spending levels, and that's why the deficit this year is going to be $2.2 trillion this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think is this bad politics for Republicans?",
      "Some of your Republican colleagues like Josh Hawley are saying that the changes to Medicaid are bad politics for America's working people and for your party.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it was a bad strategy. I think the tax cuts are good for the economy. When we passed the tax cuts in 2017, the economy grew like gangbusters. We had lowest unemployment historically. It was the great achievement of Trump's first administration.",
      "They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and not getting involved into the debt part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were with us in March, you talked about conversations you had with Elon Musk. As you know, he's just left his work with the administration.",
      "You had proposed a rescission request, a clawback of about $500 billion from money Congress had already signed off on. We know now that the White House is going to ask Congress this week for some rescissions. Sounds like it's just $9.4 billion. And it's PBS, it's NPR and it's foreign aid.",
      "Is this really the best strategy? And do you think 51 Republican senators are on board with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: First of all, I will vote for spending cuts, the more, the better. This is very, very small. To put it in perspective, if the deficit this year is $2.2 trillion, if you cut $9 billion, the deficit is going to be $2.191 trillion.",
      "It really doesn't materially change the course of the country. We should do it, by all means, and it is the low-hanging fruit. This is the money that was pointed out that was being spent for sex change operations in Guatemala, trans opera in Columbia, all this crazy spending. Yes, it should be cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sesame Street.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I had an amendment about a month \u2013 excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sesame Street. It's PBS and NPR.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Yes. And I think \u2013 yes, you're right. We will see if there's the votes to cut it.",
      "I don't think we necessarily need government programming anymore. We have so many choices on the Internet and so many choices on television. But my preference has always been in the past to cut a little bit of everything, rather than cut a lot of something.",
      "So what I have done in the past is propose a penny plan budget where we cut a certain percentage of everything, but it includes entitlements or it doesn't really work. Once you exclude the entitlements, there isn't enough money to cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So you can never achieve balance by not looking at the entitlements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The budget director on another program this morning said they may not need to use this rescission, this clawback, because the White House has other tools. Do you think they need to go through Congress? Is this overstepping?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, they absolutely have to use a recession \u2013 the rescission.",
      "And it is done by simple majority, by Republicans only. There is no filibuster of it. So it's a great tool to cut spending. If they don't use it, it will be a huge wasted opportunity. But I will tell you, they tried in the first Trump administration. And it wasn't their fault. They sent a tiny one, $16 billion, and it failed because two Republicans went the other way.",
      "So we will see what happens on this, but if we can't even cut welfare that we're giving to other countries, if we can't cut foreign aid welfare, I feel bad for the country. Interest rates are rising. We're having trouble selling our debt. We have got a lot of problems.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: Good to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to get through a lot here. But one of the things we've noticed is this new Covid variant that seems to be circulating in Asia. I believe it's NB1.8.1. It's a variant under monitoring (ph). What do we need to know?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so this appears to be a subvariant of JN1, which has been the dominant strain. So, it's believed that there is cross immunity protection. The Covid virus is going to continue to mutate and it's behaving like a common cold virus. It's now going to become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal that causes about 25 percent of the cases of the common cold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're thinking of it as like a \u2013 a \u2013 a flu-type variant? Just normal fluctuations.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than Covid. The Covid variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable. But the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target have suggested that either JN1 or any of these subvariants would be reasonable strains to target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't seem overly concerned about that.",
      "I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC. and you, with the HHS secretary, in this video announcement on Tuesday, where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the Covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule. He then had a memo to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids' vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits. Then, late Thursday, the CDC said, quote, \"shared clinical decision-making,\" which I think is just talking to your doctor \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should determine whether kids get vaccinated.",
      "Can you clearly state what the policy is, because this is confusing?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, we believe the recommendation should be with the patient and their doctor. So, we're going to get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy, young Americans because we don't want to see \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For all vaccines?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We don't \u2013 well, on the Covid vaccine schedule, we don't want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth Covid booster shot. We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat infinite annual Covid vaccine.",
      "There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new Covid boosters in young, healthy kids every year in perpetuity and a \u2013 a young girl born today should get 80 Covid mRNA shots or other Covid shots in her average lifespan. We're saying that's a theory and we'd like to check in and get some randomized controlled data. It's been about four years since the original randomized trials. So, we'd like an evidence-based approach. Dr. Persad (ph) and I published this in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" last week. And we're basically saying, we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory because \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your statement was not about repeat boosters. It says, the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. The vaccine is not recommended for healthy children. That's different than annual boosters.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: At \u2013 at \u2013 yes, at this point we're dealing \u2013 you know, it is a booster strategy \u2013 people would be getting the updated shot. So, whether or not a young, healthy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about kids who haven't gotten the shot?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, we'd like to see the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We'd love to see that \u2013 that \u2013 that data. It doesn't exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, but on a practical level. For a parent at home hearing you and trying to make sense of you.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes. We're saying, take it back to your doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If their child has not been vaccinated, are you recommending that their first encounter with Covid be an actual infection?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We're not going to push the Covid shot in young, healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it. That is a decision between a parent and their doctor. And just so you \u2013 I don't know if you know these statistics, but 80 \u2013 for 88 percent of American kids, their parents have said no to the Covid shot last season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, America \u2013 the vast majority of Americans are saying, no. Maybe they want to see some clinical data as well. Maybe they have concerns about the safety.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: The worst thing \u2013 the worst thing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't go with popularity, go with, as you're saying, data. And when we look at that data \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so let's see the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the CDC data said 41 percent of children age six months to 17 years hospitalized with Covid between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. In other words, they looked healthy.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Covid was serious for them.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, we \u2013 first of all, we know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive Covid tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital.",
      "When I go to the ICU \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: When I walk to the \u2013 we know \u2013 we know that data historically, under the Biden administration, did not distinguish being sick from Covid or an incidental positive Covid test.",
      "When you go to an ICU in America and you ask, how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with Covid, I \u2013 the answer I get again and again is, we haven't seen that in a year or years. And so, with the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young healthy kids. And the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data. And you say, forget about the data, just get it anyway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, on data and transparency, for decades, since 1964, it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, that went through this panel recommendation. I mean people watched these things during Covid. The report was then handed up. It offered debate, it offered transparency and it offered data points that people could refer back to. Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet and make that data?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: That \u2013 that panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them. If you look at the minutes of the report from \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Weren't they in the (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: They \u2013 they even say, we were \u2013 generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach. But go \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why not let them do that in June?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, in the meantime, we don't want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it. They can do it. And that committee \u2013 committee will meet and make recommendations.",
      "But you look at the minutes of the last couple years, they say, we want a simple message for everybody just so they can understand it. It was not a data-based conversation. It was a conversation based on marketing and ease. And \u2013 and I've written an article titled \"why people don't trust the CDC,\" and it's in part from that blanket strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're kind of telling them not to right now. You just said, don't trust the CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in or we get some clinical data. If there's zero clinical data, you're opining. I mean you're just \u2013 it's a theory. And so, we don't want to put out an absolute recommendation for kids with no clinical data to support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women. There is data, researchers in the U.K. analyzed a series of 67 studies which included 1.8 million women. And the journal BMJ Global Health published it. People can Google it at home. And it says the Covid vaccine \"in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospital admission, and improves pregnancy outcomes, with no safety concerns.\"",
      "This is data that shows that it is recommended or could be advised for pregnant women to take the vaccine. Why do you find otherwise?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: There's no randomized controlled trial. That's the gold standard. Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a \u2013 a co-morbid condition. So, it's a very mixed bag. So, we're saying, your obstetrician, your primary care doctor and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it.",
      "Twelve percent of pregnant women last year got the Covid shot. So, people have serious concerns and it's probably because they want to see a \u2013 a randomized trial data. The randomized trial in pregnant women \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, the world moves on. And you published in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" on May 20th, in that report you referenced, you listed pregnancy as an underlying medical condition that increases a person's risk for severe Covid. You said that.",
      "So, then, seven days later, you joined in this video announcement saying you should drop the recommendation for the Covid vaccine in healthy, pregnant women. So, what changed in the seven days?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" we simply list what the \u2013 what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk. And we're \u2013 we're just saying, decide with your doctor. We're not saying one way or the other. And the randomized trial \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doctors want data and information as well from you and you're \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, here's the data on \u2013 on pregnant women. A randomized controlled trial was set up and it was closed without any explanation. We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows. We don't have those data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: I'd say, talk to their doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When do they get the data you're promising, all these controlled studies?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In the absence of data they should talk to their doctor and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgement.",

      "You heard from the secretary of state this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party for studying in critical fields. There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country. The U.S. government already has a heightened level of vetting. What's going to change?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. There's not enough details. But what it looks like that they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. And if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts.",
      "However, this appears to be much broader and it's terribly misguided and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory. My own father was \u2013 came here on an international student visa and I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country. And I think this is going to harm America more than help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party they shouldn't be here. Does that mean all the students \u2013 the students who were children of leaders, for example, Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful. But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong, by the way, where people are actually persecuted for various freedoms they're trying to exercise and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms.",
      "So, this is a terrible \u2013 terribly misguided policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students. Do you think that there's a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off-limits?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas, because we know that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property, or worse. But the way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious. And you have to remember that the people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party. Why? Because they want these people back. They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy.",
      "And so, we are probably helping them, as well as other countries, more than helping ourselves with this policy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did not say what the consequences would be. Are you encouraged by what appears to be a statement of support for allies?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I am. I think what he's saying is largely correct. But I think the problem is, at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners, and allies in the region and cause confusion. And so, we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements and we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since you track U.S. intelligence, I wanted to ask you if you have any insight into what appears to be the swarm of Ukrainian drones that has destroyed 40 Russian military aircraft deep inside Russian territory overnight. Sources are telling our Jennifer Jacobs that the White House wasn't aware that this attack was planned.",
      "What can you tell us about the level of U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine right now and helping them with their targets?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I \u2013 I don't want to get into classified information. But what I can say is that it's a little bit more strained in light of what Donald Trump has said recently.",
      "The one thing that I can also say is that Trump was right the other day to say that Putin is crazy in the way that he's going after civilian areas in Ukraine, repeatedly. And so, the Ukrainians are striking back.",
      "At the end of the day, the only way that we can bring these hostilities to an end is by strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians. Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts. That's the best way to get to some type of armistice or truce at the negotiating table, sooner than rather later.",

      "And we're turning now to the president of Wesleyan University, Michael Roth, who joins us from Monterey, Massachusetts.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "MICHAEL ROTH (President, Wesleyan University): Good morning. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on something we were just discussing with the congressman, and that is this instruction to have new scrutiny of Chinese students. But also more broadly, Secretary Rubio said all U.S. embassies should not schedule any new student visa application appointments at this time. About 14 percent of your students are international. Are you concerned they won't be able to come back to school in September?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: I'm very concerned. Not only about Wesleyan, but about higher education in the United States.",
      "One of the great things about our system of education is that it attracts people from all over the world who want to come to America to learn. And while they're here learning, they learn about our country, our values, our freedoms. And this is really an act of intimidation to scare schools into towing the line of the current administration. It really has nothing to do with national security or with anti-Semitism. This is \u2013 this heightened scrutiny is \u2013 is meant to instill fear on college campuses, and I'm afraid it is working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is noticeable, sir, that, you know, at a time when so many higher education institutions, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, have had federal funding revoked because of their policies, we find heads of universities are fearful of speaking out. Why are you not afraid of speaking critically?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: Well, I am. I'm afraid too. But I just find it extraordinary that Americans are afraid to speak out. Especially people who, you know, run colleges and universities. Why \u2013 which \u2013 this is a free country. I've been saying it my whole life. I used to tell my parents that when I didn't want to do something. I would say, it's a free country. And this idea that we're supposed to actually conform to the ideologies in the White House, it's not just bad for Harvard or for Wesleyan, it's \u2013 it's bad for the whole country because journalists are being intimidated, law firms are being intimidated, churches, synagogues and mosques will be next. We have to defend our freedoms.",
      "And when we bring international students here, what they experience is what it's like to live in a free country. And we can't let the president change the atmosphere so that people come here and are afraid to speak out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are also some specific criticisms being lodged by members of the administration. Do you think that higher education has become too dependent on federal funding, for example, or money from foreign donors? Are there legitimate criticisms?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: There are lots of legitimate criticisms of higher education. I don't think overdependence on federal funding is the issue. Most of the federal funding you hear the press talk about are contracts to do specific kinds of research that are really great investments for the country.",
      "However, the criticisms of colleges and universities that we have, a mono culture that we don't have enough diversity, that's a criticism I've been making of my own school and the rest of higher education for years.",
      "I think we can make improvements. But the way we make improvements is not by just lining up behind a president, whoever that happens to be. We make improvements by convincing our faculty and students to broaden our perspectives, to \u2013 to welcome more political and cultural views. Not to line up and conform to the ideology of those in power.",
      "But, yes, we have work to do to clean up our own houses and we ought to get to it. But to do it under the \u2013 under this \u2013 the gun of a \u2013 of an aggressive authoritarian administration, that \u2013 that will lead to a bad outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you define some of the protests that even Wesleyan had on its campus that were, you know, critical of the state of Israel, for example, and \u2013 regarding the war against Hamas and Gaza, do you consider them to be xenophobic by definition, anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: Oh, no, not \u2013 certainly not by definition. There are lots of examples of anti-Semitism around the country. Some of them are on college campuses. They're reprehensible. When Jewish students are intimidated or afraid to practice their religion on campus or are \u2013 or are yelled at or - - it's just horrible.",
      "But at \u2013 at Wesleyan, and in many schools, the percentage of Jews protesting for Palestinians was roughly the same as the percentage of Jews on the campus generally. The \u2013 the idea that you are attacking anti- Semitism by attacking universities I think is a complete charade. It's just an excuse for getting universities to conform.",
      "We need to stamp out anti-Semitism. Those two young people just murdered because they were Jewish in Washington, that's a great example of how violence breeds violence. But the \u2013 the attack on universities is not an - - is not an attempt to defend Jews. On the contrary, I think more Jews will be hurt by these attacks than helped.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said Sunday that \"the math doesn't really add up\" on the cost of President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" while outlining his opposition as the legislation moves to the Senate this week.",
      "\"I think they're asking for too much money,\" Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Paul is among a handful of Senate Republicans who have expressed opposition to the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second term agenda that addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities and which the House narrowly approved last month. The Kentucky Republican argued Sunday that with the legislation, \"there's going to be a lot of extra money\" going toward \"padding the military budget\" and additional border security when \"the President has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any legislation.\"",
      "But Paul's red line, he indicated, is on the legislation's provision that would to raise the debt ceiling. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act. Paul has advocated for removing the debt ceiling provision from the bill and voting on the issue separately.",
      "Paul said he wants to vote for the legislation and its tax components should the debt ceiling component be removed, saying \"in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.\" But for him, the debt ceiling increase is a nonstarter.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said. \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans have sought to raise the debt ceiling as part of the broader budget package because the reconciliation process that governs the bill allows them to move forward without support from across the aisle. Separating the debt ceiling component from the broader bill would mean Senate Republicans would have to negotiate with Democrats, giving them an opportunity to extract leverage despite the GOP majorities in Congress.",
      "Still, Paul argued that the Republicans who support the spending increase should be the ones responsible for voting for a debt ceiling increase, noting that Democrats have historically supported raising the debt limit as well. The Kentucky Republican has also proposed smaller increases that suspend the debt limit for a matter of months, forcing lawmakers to verify that spending cuts have been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "Mr. Trump warned Paul about opposing the legislation in a post on Truth Social Saturday, saying \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" pushed back on the bill's forecasted impact on the deficit, pointing to income from tariffs among other things that he said will improve the full picture.",
      "The treasury secretary said changes to the bill will be \"the Senate's decision,\" noting that he's been working closely with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, whom he said has been \"doing a fantastic job.\"",
      "\"Everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the House with his slim majority \u2013 he got it out, \" Bessent said. \"Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "Asked about the administration's red lines as the bill heads to the Senate, Bessent pointed to some of the president's campaign promises, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, among others, which he said would \"have to stay in.\"",
      "On the debt limit, Bessent urged that \"the United States of America is never going to default.\" But he declined to specify an X date, or the date the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills.",
      "\"That is never going to happen,\" he added. \"We are on the warning track, and we will never hit the wall.\"",

    "summary": "As the Department of Government Efficiency leader steps away from the White House, Elon Musk talks with \"Sunday Morning\" about why he believes Trump's proposed budget clashes with his team's efforts to slash the functions of government.",
    "story": [
      "In the beginning, Donald Trump and Elon Musk got along great. \"He is a truly incredible guy,\" Trump said at a campaign rally last October, \"and I don't say that that often.\"",
      "Musk spent $288 million to elect Trump and his allies.",
      "The president invited Musk into the Oval Office and Cabinet meetings. Musk called himself \"first buddy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed Musk's idea to create a Department of Government Efficiency. [\"You gotta give him credit!\" the president told reporters.] \u00a0Musk demonstrated his goals for DOGE by wielding a chainsaw at a February meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!\" he bellowed.",
      "In four months, DOGE took the chainsaw to every federal department: 250,000 workers were fired or bought out; Musk even slashed grants and staffing at environmental agencies, like the EPA and NOAA, after decades of warning about the risks of climate change.",
      "But Musk did not enjoy the pushback. There were acts of violence; death threats; lawsuits; mandatory re-hirings; and shouting matches with Cabinet members.",
      "Tesla profits plummeted by 71%\u2014and Musk's net worth dropped by $100 billion.",
      "Last month, Musk finally left Washington, but still intended to work on DOGE a day or two a week. And this past Tuesday, he offered \"Sunday Morning\" an interview at SpaceX's headquarters near Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas.",
      "\"It's a bit unfair\"",
      "We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw a huge bust of Musk, installed by his admirers\u2014and vandalized by his critics.",
      "But the interview didn't get off to a smooth start.",
      "I asked, \"I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this?\"",
      "\"You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit,\" Musk replied.",
      "\"I'm wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. I mean, you were one of those kids, right?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I mean, I think we wanna stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy,\" Musk said.",
      "\"Oh, okay,\" I said. \"I was told anything is good, but\u2026\"",
      "\"No, well\u2014no,\" Musk replied.",
      "But Musk was\u00a0willing to talk about the DOGE firestorm. I asked him, \"You've spoken about how much of a grind and a stress it was on you, and you know, Tesla's reputation took a hit, your reputation took a hit. People are very upset about [effects on] Social Security, and national parks, and air traffic, and food safety, and cancer research, Alzheimer's research. Now that you've had a chance to look at it, might there have been a different approach?\"",
      "Musk said, \"Yeah, I think \u2026 what was starting to happen was that, like, it's a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything. So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I've had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue.\"",
      "Musk calls for U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad",
      "Musk calls for U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad",
      "I asked, \"I was just thinking about the, you know, 'move fast and break things,' you know, before you really understand what the agency does?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, I guess part of it is, like, is it depends on where you're coming from,\" Musk said. \"I'm like a proponent of smaller government, not bigger government. So, now if somebody's a proponent of, you know, more government programs and bigger government, and they see, 'Hey, DOGE is cutting all these government programs,' then they'll be fundamentally opposed to that because they just think the government should do more things. That's just a fundamental, I guess, ideological opinion.",
      "\"But my frank opinion of the government is that, like, the government is just, like, the DMV that got big, okay? So, when you say it like, 'Let's have the government do something,' you should think, 'Do you want the DMV to do it?'\"",
      "And then, Musk started talking about the Trump administration, without even being asked about Trump. \"And you know, it's not like I agree with everything the administration does,\" said Musk. \"So it's like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don't entirely agree with. But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. So then, I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything this administration's doing.\"",
      "On the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\"",
      "In Washington, federal workers say that DOGE has left the government's operations in disarray. And worst of all, it might have all been for nothing. Musk claims to have saved the government $175 billion so far (nowhere close to his original target of $2 trillion, or even his revised\u00a0target of $1 trillion).",
      "And that\u00a0was before the president's new spending bill passed the House. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the president's proposed budget will add $3.8 trillion to our debt over the next ten years. It's now being debated in the Senate.",
      "Musk said, \"I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn't decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "I said, \"I actually thought that, when this 'big, beautiful bill' came along, it'd be like, everything he's done on DOGE gets wiped out in the first year.\"",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk laughed. \"But I don't know if it could be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "And here is where the story gets a little complicated.",
      "On Tuesday, right after our interview, CBS News released a clip of it to promote this very report. It was that part, where Musk criticizes Trump's spending bill, and his remarks became news. It went all the way to the White House, where the president was asked about Musk's criticism of the bill. Within 24 hours, Musk announced that his time in the Trump administration was officially over. Out of DOGE, out of government.",
      "Musk said that the reason was that his limited 130-day stint as advisor was ending. But until that moment, he'd been saying that he still intended to work on DOGE part-time. \"Well, DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,\" he told us. \"I will have some participation in that, but as I've said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.\"",
      "Truth is, the Trump-Musk relationship had already seemed to be cooling. The president used to post about Musk about six times a week. But by April, he'd stopped mentioning Musk altogether.",
      "Still, on Friday, they held a media event at the White House to confirm their mutual admiration\u2014and to leave the door open for future collaboration. \"Elon's really not leaving,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's gonna be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.\"",
      "Musk added, \"The DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They're going to continue doing an incredible job, and I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president.\"",
      "Musk might be the first to admit that his DOGE experiment gave him a black eye\u2014like the actual black eye he had on Friday, which he says he got from his five-year-old son \u2026 or the matching one on that statue.",
      "At least for now, Musk says that his focus will be running his business ventures: Tesla, Starlink, X, xAI, Neuralink, Optimus robots, the Boring Company, and SpaceX.",
      "I asked, \"Are all of your businesses related in some way?\"",
      "\"I guess you can think of the businesses as things that improve the probable trajectory of civilization,\" Musk replied. \"So you know, for making life multi-planetary or extending life to Mars, the idea there is to ensure the long-term survival of life and consciousness as we know it.\"",
      "After our interview Tuesday, we were invited to witness the ninth launch of his Starship, the biggest rocket ever built. The two previous Starship tests ended in explosions \u2013 or, as SpaceX puts it, \"rapid unscheduled disassemblies.\" So, all eyes were on Test Launch 9 to see if a Starship could return to Earth in one piece.",
      "As Musk left our interview to watch the launch, he said something that could sum up all his enterprises: \"I can't guarantee success, but I can guarantee excitement.\"",
      "In the end, Elon Musk's giant rocket spun out of control. It did not survive re-entry.",

      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",
      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in adults 65 and older and people age 12 to 64 who have at least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus.",
      "That's the same limit the FDA set in licensing another COVID-19 vaccine option from competitor Novavax.",
      "Those restrictions are a departure from how the U.S. has handled COVID-19 vaccines until now, reflecting skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials.",
      "Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall.",
      "The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said.",

      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide - so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Incoming president's background",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who wouldn't be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \"noble\" fights in his life. The revelations didn't seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Nawrocki endorsed by Trump",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week, the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Mr. Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",

      "\"There was fire from all directions, from naval warships, from tanks and drones,\" said Amr Abu Teiba, who was in the crowd.",
      "He said he saw at least 10 bodies with gunshot wounds and several other wounded people, including women. People used carts to ferry the dead and wounded to the field hospital. \"The scene was horrible,\" he said.",
      "At least 51 people were killed and more than 170 were wounded, CBS News has learned.",
      "Israel's military said in a statement that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site, citing an initial inquiry.",
      "The U.S. and Israeli-backed\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)\u00a0said in a statement that it delivered aid 16 truckloads of aid \"without incident\" early on Sunday and dismissed what it referred to as \"false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos\" around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited.",

      "The U.N. system has struggled to bring in aid after Israel slightly eased its total blockade of the territory last month. Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",

      "Ceasefire talks falter",
      "Sunday's incident happened as Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",

      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",
      "\"We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\" said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.",

    "story": [
      "Two fans died and a police officer was placed under an induced coma after celebrations around France, to mark Paris Saint-Germain's historic Champions League victory, turned violent Saturday night, French authorities said Sunday. The Champions League is Europe's biggest soccer prize.",
      "In addition, at least 559 people were arrested nationwide during the mass celebrations, including at least 491 in the capital, the French interior ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "The fatalities marred what started as a night of exuberance after PSG clinched its first \u2014 and long-awaited \u2014 Champions League title, in a 5-0 win over Inter Milan. The Eiffel Tower glowed in team colors, and fans partied through the night in celebrations that were largely peaceful but degenerated into violence in some areas.",
      "A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the western city of Dax during a PSG street party after Saturday night's final in Munich, the national police service said. A man in his 20s was killed in Paris when his scooter was hit by a car during PSG celebrations, the interior minister's office said. The circumstances of both are being investigated.",
      "A police officer was hit accidentally by fireworks at a PSG gathering in Coutances in northwest France and placed in an artificial coma because of grave eye injuries, the national police service said. A total of 192 people were injured around the capital, four of them seriously, the Paris police chief said.",
      "The officer hit by fireworks was among \"many\" police officers and firefighters around France who sustained injuries while intervening to restore order in Champions League celebrations gone awry, said the French National Police.",
      "The team is expected to return to a big victory parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on Sunday afternoon, with up to 110,000 people allowed along the iconic, tree-lined avenue to see the victorious players.",
      "Later, the team will join fans packed into PSG's home stadium, the Parc des Princes,\u00a0on the city's western edge, for a concert and light show and official presentation of the Champions League trophy.",
      "A wide swath of central Paris was closed to traffic for the exceptional day. The security measures are also impacting the French Open unfolding nearby.",
      "Thousands of police are being deployed to keep order, and will employ similar tactics as they did Saturday night, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told reporters. AP reporters saw tear gas used near the stadium and water cannons used near the Arc de Triomphe to disperse rowdy crowds.",
      "In addition to the injuries and arrests, Nunez said four stores were looted overnight. Firefighters were so busy extinguishing garbage can fires in the middle of celebrations and dealing with other emergencies that the fire hotline was saturated.",
      "By 2 a.m. on Sunday, a total of 294 arrests had been made, including 30 people who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Two cars were set alight close to Parc des Princes, police added.",
      "At the Place de la Bastille, there were joyous scenes as fans climbed onto the base of the famous column, singing, dancing and letting off flares, while those around joined in.",
      "At one point, motorbikes loudly revved their engines and the crowd cheered as they did laps around the column. There were no police nearby and, by 1 a.m., the atmosphere was upbeat with no tensions and plenty of singing.",
      "Nunez blamed the scattered troubles on \u2033thousands of people who came to commit acts of violence\u2033 instead of watching the match. He noted similar unrest on the sidelines of prior celebrations in the capital, such as after France's World Cup win in 2018.",

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

      "In a statement, the militant group said its response aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, the Israeli military's complete withdrawal from Gaza and the \"unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid.\" Hamas said in their statement that the agreement would include the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A senior Hamas official tells The Associated Press that \"there some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "The office of Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, said in a statement on social media on Saturday that it had received Hamas' response to the proposal, but it was \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.\"",
      "\"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the statement said. \"That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not reject Witkoff's proposal.",
      "\"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\"",
      "A\u00a0draft of the deal obtained by CBS News\u00a0indicated that Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians. The draft also outlined that humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal.",
      "There was no immediate response from mediators or Israeli officials.",

      "\"After nearly 80 days of total blockade, communities are starving \u2013 and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,\" the WFP said in a statement. \"This delivery is a start, but it's not nearly enough.\"",
      "A nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of nearly 2.3 million people to the brink of famine. While the pressure slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, organizations say there still isn't nearly enough food getting in.",

      "A witness in the southern city of Khan Younis told The Associated Press the U.N. convoy was stopped at a makeshift roadblock and offloaded by desperate civilians in their thousands. Most people carried bags of flour on their backs or heads. He said at one point a forklift was used to offload pallets from the stranded trucks. The witness spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal.",
      "The United Nations said earlier this month that Israeli authorities have forced them to use unsecured routes within areas controlled by the Israeli military in the eastern areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, where armed gangs are active and trucks were stopped.",

On Friday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it only picked up five truckloads of cargo from the Palestinian side of the Kareem Shalom crossing, and the other 60 trucks had to return due to intense hostilities in the area.",
      "An Israeli official said his country has offered the U.N. logistical and operational support but \"the U.N. is not doing their job.\" Instead, a new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout. Israel says\u00a0the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0will replace the massive aid operation that the U.N. and others have carried out throughout the war.",
      "It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that a significant diversion takes place.",
      "Cindy McCain, the WFP's executive director, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" last Sunday that there is no evidence to support Israel's claims that Hamas is responsible for the looting of their aid trucks.",
      "\"These people are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it,\" she said. \"This doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime, or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Israel is continuing its military campaign across Gaza.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said that at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours.

    "story": [
      "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog said Saturday, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",
      "The report comes at a sensitive time as Tehran and Washington have been holding several rounds of talks in the past weeks over a possible nuclear deal that President Trump is trying to reach.",
      "The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 which was seen by the Associated Press and CBS News \u2014 says that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%.",
      "That's an increase of 294.9 pounds \u2014 or almost 50% \u2014 since the IAEA's last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put this stockpile level at 605.8 pounds.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Tehran on the new IAEA report.",
      "The IAEA report raised a stern warning, saying that Iran is now \"the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material\" \u2014 something the agency said was of \"serious concern.\"",
      "Approximately 92.5 pounds of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%, according to the watchdog.",
      "The IAEA report, a quarterly, also estimated that as of May 17, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium \u2014 which includes uranium enriched to lower levels \u2014 stood at 20,387.4 pounds. That's an increase of 2,101.4 pounds since February's report.",
      "\"While safeguarded enrichment activities are not forbidden in and of themselves, the fact that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon State in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60% remains a matter of serious concern, which has drawn international attention given the potential proliferation implications,\" the report states.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Saturday night, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, has sent a \"detailed and acceptable proposal\" to Iran.",
      "\"President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,\" Leavitt said. \"Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media.\"",
      "Iran's nuclear program",
      "Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \"several\" nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.",
      "Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \"undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\"",
      "Israel said Saturday's report was a clear warning sign that \"Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program,\" according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "It said IAEA's report \"strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years \u2014 the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful.\"",
      "It also added that Iran's level of enrichment \"has no civilian justification whatsoever\" and appealed on the international community to \"act now to stop Iran.\"",
      "It is rare for Netanyahu to make statements on Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, underlying the urgency with which he sees the matter.",
      "Grossi said Saturday that he \"reiterates his urgent call upon Iran to cooperate fully and effectively\" with the IAEA's years-long investigation into uranium traces discovered at several sites in Iran.",
      "The IAEA also circulated to member states on Saturday a second, 22-page confidential report, also seen by the AP, that Grossi requested following a resolution passed by the 35-member IAEA Board of Governors last November.",
      "In this so-called \"comprehensive report,\" the IAEA said that Iran's cooperation with the agency has \"been less than satisfactory\" when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.",
      "Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret military nuclear program until 2003.",
      "One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant.",
      "Iran denied this but in 2019 IAEA inspectors detected the presence of manmade uranium particles there.",
      "After initially blocking IAEA access, inspectors were able to collect samples in 2020 from two other locations where they also detected the presence of manmade uranium particles.",
      "The three locations became known as Turquzabad, Varamin, and Marivan. A fourth undeclared location named as Lavisan-Shian is also part of the IAEA probe but IAEA inspectors never visited the site because it was razed and demolished by Iran after 2003.",
      "In Saturday's comprehensive report, the IAEA says that the \"lack of answers and clarifications provided by Iran\" to questions the watchdog had regarding Lavisan-Shian, Varamin and Marivan \"has led the agency to conclude that these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.\"",
      "How the world could react to U.N. report",
      "Saturday's comprehensive report could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, leading to a potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West.",
      "European countries could move to trigger snap-back sanctions against Iran that were lifted under the original 2015 nuclear deal ahead of October, when the deal formally expires.",
      "On Thursday, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country's nuclear program to continue.",
      "The comments came a day after Trump said he has told Netanyahu to hold off on striking Iran to give the U.S. administration more time to push for a new deal with Tehran.",
      "Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the \"not too distant future.\"",
      "\"They don't want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,\" Trump said of Iran. He added, \"That would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u200b reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China, while insisting that they also contribute more to their own defense.",
      "He said Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the U.S. has pledged to defend.",
      "China's army \"is rehearsing for the real deal,\" Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore. \"We are not going to sugarcoat it \u2014 the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\"",
      "The head of China's delegation accused Hegseth of making \"groundless accusations.\"",
      "\"Some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and some are cases of a thief crying 'stop thief,\" said Rear Adm. Hu Gangfeng, vice president of China's National Defense University. He did not offer specific objections.",
      "\"These actions are nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilize the Asia-Pacific region,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth says China is training to invade Taiwan",
      "China has a stated goal of ensuring its military is capable of taking Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.",
      "China also has built sophisticated, artificial islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and developed highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the United States to create its own space-based \"Golden Dome\" missile defenses.\u00a0President Trump said his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it's \"actively training for it, every day.\"",
      "Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.",
      "He urged Indo-Pacific countries to increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross domestic product that European nations are now pressed to contribute.",
      "\"We must all do our part,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Following the speech, the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas pushed back at Hegseth's comment that European countries should focus their defense efforts in their own region and leave the Indo-Pacific more to the U.S. She said that with North Korean troops fightingforn Russia and China supporting Moscow, European and Asian security were \"very much interlinked.\"",
      "Questions about U.S. commitment to Indo-Pacific",
      "He also repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster the U.S. military in the Indo-Pacific to provide a more robust deterrent. While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific and established new military agreements throughout the region, a full shift has never been realized.",
      "Instead, U.S. military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term, that's also been the case.",
      "In the last few months, the Trump administration has taken a Patriot missile defense battalion out of the Indo-Pacific in order to send it to the Middle East, a massive logistical operation that required 73 military cargo aircraft flights, and sent Coast Guard ships back to the U.S. to help defend the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Hegseth was asked why the U.S. pulled those resources if the Indo-Pacific is the priority theater. He did not directly answer but said the shift of resources was necessary to defend against Houthi missile attacks launched from Yemen, and to bolster protections against illegal immigration into the U.S.",
      "At the same time, he stressed the need for American allies and partners to step up their own defense spending and preparations, saying the U.S. was not interested in going it alone.",
      "\"Ultimately, a strong, resolute and capable network of allies and partners is our key strategic advantage,\" he said. \"China envies what we have together, and it sees what we can collectively bring to bear on defense, but it's up to all of us to ensure that we live up to that potential by investing.\"",
      "The Indo-Pacific nations caught in between have tried to balance relations with both the U.S. and China over the years. Beijing is the primary trading partner for many, but is also feared as a regional bully, in part due to its increasingly aggressive claims on natural resources such as critical fisheries.",
      "Hegseth cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.",
      "\"Economic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Asked how he would reconcile that statement with Trump's threat of steep tariffs on most in the region, Hegseth he was \"in the business of tanks, not trade.\"",
      "But Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who is part of a congressional delegation attending Shangri-La, objected to pressuring regional allies.",
      "\"The United States is not asking people to choose between us and the PRC,\" Duckworth said, in reference to the People's Republic of China.",
      "Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles welcomed Hegseth's assurance that the Indo-Pacific was an American strategic priority and agreed that Australia and other nations needed to do their part.",
      "\"Reality is that there is no effective balance of power in this region absent the United States, but we cannot leave it to the United States alone,\" he said.",
      "Still, Marles suggested the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies were counterproductive. \"The shock and disruption from the high tariffs has been costly and destabilizing.\"",
      "China sends lower-level delegation",
      "China usually sends its own defense minister to the conference, but Dong Jun did not attend this year in a snub to the U.S. over Trump's erratic tariffs war. His absence was something the U.S. delegation said it intended to capitalize on.",
      "\"We are here this morning. And somebody else isn't,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Asked by a member of the Chinese delegation how committed the U.S. would remain if Asian alliances like ASEAN had differences with Washington, Hegseth said the U.S. would not be constrained by \"the confines of how previous administrations looked at this region.\"",
      "\"We're opening our arms to countries across the spectrum \u2014 traditional allies, non-traditional allies,\" he said.",
      "He said U.S. support would not require local governments to align with the West on cultural or climate issues.",

    "story": [
      "The United States and Israel are waiting for\u00a0Hamas\u00a0to respond to a 60-day\u00a0Gaza ceasefire\u00a0proposal, the White House said Thursday.",
      "Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "During the proposed 60-day ceasefire, a draft of the deal obtained by CBS News indicated that Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Five living hostages and nine deceased from the \"list of 58\" remaining hostages would be released on the first day of the agreement, while a second group would be released on the seventh day, according to the document.",
      "According to the document, humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal, and it will be distributed through \"agreed upon channels that will include the United Nations and Red Crescent.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\"",
      "Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\"",
      "A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said.",
      "The proposal obtained by CBS News outlines that all Israeli offensive military activities in Gaza will cease once the deal is agreed upon, and that during the 60 days, there will be a cessation of aerial movement in the Gaza Strip for 10 hours daily, or 12 hours daily when the exchange of hostages and prisoners take place.",
      "Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin on the first day of the agreement and would include discussing the exchange of the remaining hostages, issues relating to redeployment and withdrawals of Israeli forces, and long-term security within Gaza.",
      "President Trump, who on Friday told reporters in the Oval Office that they are \"very close to an agreement on Gaza,\" will personally announce the ceasefire agreement, the proposal says.",
      "A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead.",
      "An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas\u00a0ended in March\u00a0after the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it, and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0he was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will allow the Trump administration to terminate a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal battle over the effort to end the legal protections proceeds.",
      "The high court agreed to grant a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in response to a federal district court order halting Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's decision to revoke en masse a grant of humanitarian parole to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through a special program.",
      "The parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 people from the risk of deportation.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "Jackson, joined by Sotomayor, wrote that pausing the lower court's order \"would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgment regarding the legal arguments at issue,\" and she lambasted the majority for determining that it is \"in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the dissenting courts decide their legal claims.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration is confident in the legality of its actions and believes the Supreme Court will rule in its favor if it is asked to decide the merits of the Homeland Security secretary's blanket termination of parole.",
      "\"Just as we always said, President Trump and Secretary Noem acted within their legal authority to revoke temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands of individuals during the Biden administration,\" she said in a statement. \"The Biden administration's program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration, and President Trump fulfilled his promise by eliminating it.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it can now \"once again\" begin removing migrants who received humanitarian parole under the CHNV program.",
      "President Trump's administration has been steadily turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as it fights more than 200 lawsuits targeting many policies from the president's second-term agenda, though many of the court fights involving his efforts to crack down on immigration into the U.S. have led to heightened tensions with the federal judiciary.",
      "The dispute over the administration's attempt to revoke the temporary legal status granted to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is separate from other challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, which has been blocked by some courts. The high court has also allowed the Department of Homeland Security to revoke protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans for now.",
      "Since 1952, federal immigration law has allowed the executive branch to grant noncitizens parole for humanitarian reasons. The Department of Homeland Security created parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans during the Biden administration in late 2022 and early 2023, which required migrants seeking parole to apply through a sponsor who is in the U.S. lawfully and authorized them to work in the U.S. for two years.",
      "The Biden administration created the programs to address the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the protections promoted legal immigration. It did not allow those who came to the U.S. with the temporary protections to renew their parole beyond the two-year period.",
      "But soon after Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to terminate all parole programs, including CHNV. Acting on the executive order, Noem in March announced the Department of Homeland Security would be ending the CHNV program, with any grants of parole still in effect expiring by April 24.",
      "The move is part of the president's broader efforts to tamp down on immigration into the U.S., an issue that emerged as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for a second term in the White House.",
      "A group of 23 individuals, including several CHNV parolees, and a nonprofit organization challenged Noem's termination of the program, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts agreed to halt Noem's blanket revocation of migrants' temporary legal status.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani found that the secretary could not categorically terminate the grants of parole because federal law required parole to be exercised on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which declined to pause the district court's order pending appeal. The Justice Department then sought the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in court filings that the district court's injunction nullifies \"one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions.\"",
      "He wrote that order had the effect of \"needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election.\"",
      "But lawyers for the parole beneficiaries warned that absent the relief granted by the district judge, roughly half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans lawfully in the U.S. \"would have become undocumented, legally unemployable, and subject to mass expulsion on an expedited basis at midnight on April 24.\"",
      "\"The secretary is admittedly under no obligation to continue the CHNV parole process that brought class members here, but she nonetheless must respect required procedures and apply the law correctly before revoking their parole and upending their lives and causing mass disruption to their families, employers, and communities,\" they told the justices in a filing, adding that allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its mass termination of parole \"would cause an immense amount of needless human suffering.\"",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself from infostealer malware",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has\u00a0revealed the existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat.",
      "The information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured.

There were also account details for financial services and official portals used by state institutions.",

      "Fowler believes the data was harvested using an infostealer. These lightweight tools are favored by cybercriminals for their ability to silently extract login credentials and other private information from compromised devices. Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks.",
      "After reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.",
      "To verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate.

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

I'm so happy to be involved in something big that will help many people.\"\u00a0While ALS \"really sucks,\" as Smith says, his journey shows how innovation and determination can bring light to even the darkest rooms.

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 14:48:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",
      "A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot. (MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

      "Upload it to Amazon KDP or Gumroad, and now you\u2019ve got a digital product that can earn money in your sleep. People pay for convenience, and you have life experience worth sharing.",
      "Final Thought",
      "You don\u2019t need to master AI to start earning with it. You just need to start using it. These five prompts are a low-risk, high-potential way to get your feet wet. And if you need a hand turning these sparks into something bigger, I\u2019m here.",
      "I built my multimillion-dollar business with no investors and no debt. I\u2019ve done this without a big team or expensive consultants. And I\u2019d love to help you do the same.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses.

      "A 2.45-kWh lithium-ion battery powers the Hydroflyer Sport, giving you anywhere from one and a half to three hours of ride time, depending on how hard you push it. The top speed is an impressive 28 mph, and you can travel up to 25 miles on a single charge. The Hydroflyer Sport's modular design lets you swap out parts or customize your setup.

      "ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have become amazing helpers for everyday tasks. Whether it's summarizing complex ideas, designing a birthday card or even planning your apartment's layout, you can get impressive results with just a simple prompt. But as helpful as these AI tools are, their convenience comes with hidden risks, especially when it comes to your personal privacy.",

      "How these tools work and why that matters",
      "If you haven't tried an LLM like ChatGPT before, here's the gist: They're advanced language processors that chat with you through text. No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",

They need to access real online sources to work.\u00a0In other words, your data is already out there on the internet; AI tools just make it easier to find.\u00a0And if you look at the sources, most of the information you wouldn\u2019t want shared online, like your address, relatives and so on, is made public by people-search sites. Other sources include social media, like LinkedIn and Facebook, as well as public databases. But none of them are as invasive as people-search sites.",

      "Using AI tools: How to find and list data broker sites with your personal data",
      "Use AI tools and ask them to run a deep search on yourself. It\u2019s not a perfect or complete solution; LLMs tend to shorten their responses to save resources.

The opt-out forms are typically located at the bottom of each site, in the footer. The naming can vary from \"Do Not Sell My Info\" to \"Opt-Out\" or something similar. Each people-search site is a little different. Opting out of every people-search site that exposes your personal information is a mammoth task. I\u2019ve discussed it in more detail\u00a0here. Alternatively, you can automate this process.",
      "A woman using ChatGPT on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Data removal services are real-time and energy savers when it comes to protecting your personal information online. The way these services work is simple. They send hundreds of data removal requests on your behalf to people-search sites you might not even know exist but are still exposing your data. And with some services, the process goes even further than that.",

This way, you can just sign up and let them handle the work in the background.

With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",

      "Adjusting your social media privacy settings can greatly reduce the amount of personal information available to data brokers.

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",

The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users.

      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",

      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms.

      "Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright breaks down the dangers of deepfake video technology on 'Unfiltered.'",
      "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",
      "From hijacked AI accounts and manipulated models to live video scams and data poisoning, the report paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, one that's touching more lives than ever before.",

      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitationsPhrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenariosAsking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",

      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",

      "Poisoned AI models are spreading misinformation",
      "Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:",
      "Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during developmentRetrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers",

      "In 2024, attackers uploaded 100 tampered AI models to the open-source platform Hugging Face. These poisoned models looked like helpful tools, but when people used them, they could spread false information or output malicious code.",
      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "AI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here\u2019s how to stay protected:",
      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",

With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",

With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "Deputy Consul General of Israel in New York, Tsach Saar, is sending a warning to America after the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in D.C.: Radicalism isn\u2019t just a problem for Israelis and Jews \u2014 it\u2019s a problem for all Americans.",
      "\"It\u2019s not an Israeli problem and not a Jewish problem, it's an American problem. These people who incite, who call for violence, who use antisemitic rhetoric, at the end of the day, they are shaking the pillars of American democracy,\" Saar told Fox News Digital.",
      "The diplomat also spoke about the phrase \"globalize the Intifada,\" a slogan that has become more common at anti-Israel demonstrations. Saar says the phrase refers to those seeking to export violence beyond the Middle East to places like America, making the D.C. shooting much more than a local tragedy.",

It weakens the American democracy and that puts it very, very high on the agenda for Americans themselves. And I have to tell you, people that I speak with, they know exactly what I'm talking about and they understand how severe the problem is. And now it's time for action,\" he said.",
      "Elias Rodriguez, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum, was heard chanting \"free, free Palestine\" during his arrest. This prompted renewed discussions about the rhetoric used in anti-Israel demonstrations in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre and resulting war in Gaza.",

While Saar acknowledged that America\u2019s First Amendment \"is sacred,\" he warned that there is a difference between expressing one\u2019s viewpoint and inciting violence.",
      "Even as Jews and Israelis feel unsafe, Saar does not think the answer is to hide who they are, but rather to unite and \"resist by all legal means\" those who use lies and hateful rhetoric to incite violence.",
      "\"The answer is not hiding our stars [of David], we should be proud of who we are,\" Saar said. He added that he had seen individuals on social media expressing support for the murders of Milgrim and Lischinsky.",

      "Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with a video of Malema shouting \"Shoot to kill, Kill the Boer (the Afrikaner), kill the farmer,\" when the South African president, a neighbor of Malema\u2019s in Johannesburg, visited the Oval Office earlier this month.",

      "Trump has offered Afrikaner farmers, descendants of mostly Dutch settlers,\u00a0refuge in the U.S., citing controversial and disputed claims that they are facing White genocide and forced land seizures.",
      "The self-styled commander in chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Party, Malema, a Marxist-Leninist, was the head of the Youth League of South Africa\u2019s biggest party, the African National Congress (ANC), but he was kicked out for bad-mouthing its leadership.",
      "In last year\u2019s election, votes for the EFF slumped to under 10%, and both of Malema\u2019s sidekicks, party co-founders and men he described as \"brothers,\" left him and joined a competing party.",
      "So it did not come as a surprise to many that, allegedly to spite President Trump, Malema just days later jumped up, literally, onto the stage at the very next rally he was due to appear at to yell \"Kill the farmer, I repeat kill the farmer.\"",
      "In 2022, South Africa\u2019s Constitutional Court, the equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court, ruled the chant is not hate speech, declaring it is only the words of a song. Malema sits on the Judicial Services Commission, a body which appoints the Court\u2019s judges.",
      "To Malema, critics say, the chant may be more than just song lyrics. At least twice he told reporters here, \"We have not called for the killing of White people \u2013 at least for now.\" On another occasion, he demanded, \"We will cut the throat of Whiteness.\"",

      "Some say Malema is running two strategies - one which follows the mantra \"There\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity,\" and the other to act like a small child that makes a lot of noise, hoping to be noticed, but with little real effect.",
      "Analyst J. Brooks Spector told Fox News Digital that Malema\u00a0\"has crafted a political reputation as the \u2018bad boy\u2019 of South African politics.\"",
      "Spector, a former U.S. diplomat who lives in Johannesburg and is associate editor of the Daily Maverick, continued. \"In a country with a third of its workforce unemployed, and higher among young people, and poverty still a fact of life for many more, his (Malema\u2019s) populism initially drew significant support and enthusiasm among voters. However, his popularity as a political leader has faded somewhat.\"",
      "Malema openly supports the terror group Hamas, telling a rally in 2023, shortly after the October 7 attack on Israel, \"when you are oppressed, you only have one option, shoot to kill. There is nothing wrong with what Hamas is doing. The EFF is going to arm Hamas.\" He also shouted he intended to shut down the Israeli Embassy in South Africa. \"We are going to remove this embassy,\" he yelled to loud cheers.",

      "Allegations also suggest that Malema and his then right-hand man, Floyd Shivambu, benefitted from \"dodgy\" deals with the South African VBS bank, which subsequently collapsed, leading to people losing their pension savings.",
      "\"In 2018, the VBS scandal exposed widespread looting by bank officials and politicians, including senior leaders of the EFF, Floyd Shivambu and Julius Malema,\"\u00a0the Opposition Democratic Alliance\u2019s (DA) Baxolile Nodada stated last August.",
      "On Friday, the DA\u2019s federal executive member and national spokesperson, Willie Aucamp, told Fox News Digital the DA \"isn\u2019t letting the VBS scandal fade into the background. Not when over R2 billion ($111 million) was looted from pensioners, struggling municipalities, and poor communities. The DA has been leading the charge to expose those behind this daylight robbery, including Julius Malema, leader of the EFF.\"\u00a0He continued, \"The DA laid criminal charges back in 2018, but six years later, not a single charge has been prosecuted by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Justice for the victims of VBS is long overdue. The DA will continue pushing for the arrest and prosecution of every single person involved - Malema included.\"",
      "Speaking in Cape Town in July last year, Malema said \"I will never be intimidated by VBS. No leader of the EFF received VBS money.\"",

      "Ukraine\u2019s Security Service said it has struck more than 40 Russian bombers deep inside Russian territory in what would be one of the largest and most audacious attacks on Russian territory in the yearslong conflict.",
      "A source within the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told NBC News that the country targeted \u201c41 strategic Russian aircraft\u201d in an offensive operation code-named \u201cSpiderweb.\u201d",
      "The source also released dramatic video purportedly showing a drone attack at the Belaya air base in Russia\u2019s Irkutsk region, located in Siberia, nearly 3,000 miles from Ukraine. The video captures bombers under attack, with explosions visible and smoke rising from the scene.",
      "\u201cPreliminary estimates indicate that enemy aviation has suffered over $2 billion in damage,\u201d the source said. \u201cEnemy strategic bombers are burning en masse in Russia.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Ukraine's Security Service for executing what it called its longest-range operation, more than 18 months in the making, calling it a historic success.",
      "The source inside the SBU confirmed that the remarkable attack had been in the works for over a year and a half. According to the source, the SBU first smuggled drones into Russia, followed by mobile wooden cabins. Once they were inside Russia, the drones were hidden under cabin roofs mounted on cargo trucks. During the attack, the roofs opened remotely, enabling the drones to launch at Russian bombers, according to the source, who added that the operation was overseen by Zelenskyy and executed by the country\u2019s Security Service.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the claims.",
      "Russia did not immediately comment on the bombings, but Irkutsk\u2019s regional governor, Igor Kobzev, said on Telegram that there had been a drone attack \u201con a military unit in the settlement of Sredny.\u201d",
      "He did not say whether the Belaya air base or others were hit, but said the drone was launched from a truck.",

    "story": [
      "Christopher Praino signed a waiver relinquishing his disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs after he was ordered to active duty in fall 2019.",
      "In a letter, the VA confirmed it would terminate his roughly $965 monthly payments because, by law, he could not receive both VA benefits and active-duty pay at the same time.",
      "But the agency did not fully halt the payments. Instead, it sent various monthly amounts over the next three years, ranging from $0 to over $2,000, Praino\u2019s records show.",
      "\u201cThe VA never stopped,\u201d he said, \u201cafter response after response, call after call, walk-in after walk-in.\u201d",
      "In 2023, despite Praino\u2019s repeated efforts to rectify the inconsistent installments that should have ended years ago, the VA informed him in a letter that he owed nearly $68,000. That year, the government began automatically clawing some of the money out of his military paychecks, which he uses to support five children and his wife, leaving him in dire financial straits.",
      "\u201cNo words can tell you the emotional, mental and physical heartache I have every day dealing with this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s eating away at me.\u201d",
      "In a recent congressional oversight hearing focused on why the VA regularly overpays veterans and then asks for the money back, agency officials partially blamed veterans for the exorbitant errors, telling lawmakers that some veterans have been failing to report eligibility changes that would have lowered their monthly disability compensation or pension payments.",
      "But Praino and two other veterans told NBC News they did notify the VA in a timely manner. Yet, records show the agency continued overpaying them for months, sometimes years, before asking for the money back.",
      "The long-delayed adjustments, which can cause veterans to incur life-changing debts, may indicate another operational shortfall at the VA weeks after officials testified that the agency doles out about $1 billion in overpayments each year due to administrative errors and other factors.",
      "The VA overpaid about $5.1 billion in disability compensation and pension payments from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, according to Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.",
      "The issue is recurring and getting worse, Luttrell told NBC News, even as the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars in grants and slashed thousands of federal jobs in an attempt to trim what it sees as waste and inefficiency in federal spending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the veterans\u2019 fault,\u201d Luttrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the system that is failing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency, under new leadership, is \u201cworking hard to fix longstanding problems, such as billions of dollars per year in overpayments.\u201d",
      "Luttrell said the overpayment issue is complex, largely stemming from tiers of human error and an outdated computer system that he said does not adequately allow information to be shared between local and national VA offices.",
      "\u201cYou have to get the software to talk to each other. You have to get the veterans to communicate. You have to get the actors inside the VA to move accordingly, and then you have to make sure the system is lined out as it needs to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is such a complex problem set to solve.\u201d",
      "\u2018The processes are broken\u2019",
      "In 2015, after his divorce was finalized, veteran Brent Aber said he went to his local VA\u2019s office in Akron, Ohio, to remove his ex-wife as a dependent.",
      "\u201cI thought, OK, all is done,\u201d he said.",
      "Aber said it felt like he was officially closing a difficult chapter in his life. But eight years later, another nightmare emerged when the national VA\u2019s Debt Management Center sent him a letter, notifying him that he had to pay back more than $17,700.",
      "Aber, who served in both the Navy and Army for a dozen years, said he called the VA to find out how he accrued this debt. He said he was told that different VA computer systems do not communicate with one another, meaning the dependent removal may have never been registered nationally, and his monthly payments had not decreased as they should have.",
      "Kasperowicz, the VA spokesperson, disputed claims made by Aber and Luttrell about the computer systems, saying the VA has had a centralized claims system since 2013 that \u201censures updated information is reflected\u201d for each veteran.\u00a0Upon follow-up, Luttrell could not be reached for comment on the VA\u2019s dispute.",
      "Kasperowicz did not offer an explanation as to what happened in Aber\u2019s case and said the VA has no record of his dependent change request from 2015.",
      "Aber said he spent more than a year fighting the recoupment and claimed financial hardship. But in May, the VA began withholding nearly $500 from his monthly compensation payments until the debt is cleared.",
      "To make up for the loss, Aber, who lost both of his legs in a training accident and is now mostly bedridden, said he stopped using a house cleaning service and is mostly eating cheaper, microwavable food.",
      "\u201cI provided all the paperwork at the time of the divorce, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter,\u201d he said.",
      "The 50-year-old said the VA\u2019s recoupment hurts more as he fights for medical care.",
      "He said he has been struggling with severe pain and swelling since he underwent revision surgery on his limbs about two years ago with the hopes of getting fitted again for prosthetics.",
      "While Aber said his primary care doctor referred him to an orthopedic surgeon with expertise in double amputations, he said the VA denied the referral.",
      "Kasperowicz said the \"entirety of the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System orthopedic section\" and other health care providers have evaluated Aber and \"all have agreed that there are no additional surgical options that would provide him pain relief or improved function.\"",
      "\"The medical consensus is to continue amputee clinic, physical therapy, pain management and behavioral health treatments to address the complexity of his condition,\" Kasperowicz said.",
      "Aber said the double battle he has been waging against the VA has left him feeling frustrated and betrayed.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been completely done wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "In Bonaire, Georgia, veteran John Mullens reported a dependent change in February after his 18-year-old son became eligible for a separate VA educational benefit that provides monthly payments to cover the cost of school. By law, veterans cannot receive both benefits at the same time, which Mullens knew from his own research.",
      "NBC News reviewed records from his VA portal, showing he filed a request to remove a dependent on Feb. 18. The claim was assigned to a reviewer on Feb. 19, the portal shows. And there were no other updates until May when Mullens received a letter from the VA, alerting him to the duplicate payments, which the VA said resulted in about $340 in overpayments each month.",
      "\u201cThey did nothing with the information and continued to overpay me,\u201d Mullens, 55, said. \u201cThe processes are broken.\u201d",
      "Kasperowicz said it currently takes an average of about 21 days for the VA to remove a dependent and an average of about 91 days to add one.",
      "Of the nearly $1.4 billion overpaid in fiscal year 2021, Kasperowicz said about $913 million was related to dependent changes.",
      "The VA does not track data showing how many veterans in overpayment cases actually did report changes on time, Kasperowicz said.",
      "The overpayments sometimes span many years. In 2023, the VA temporarily suspended the collection of pension debts for thousands of low-income wartime veterans and their survivors after the agency identified an issue with its income verification that led to overpayments between 2011 and 2022.",
      "On May 14, Luttrell and other members of the House subcommittee pressed VA officials to explain how the agency planned to fix the problem.",
      "Nina Tann, executive director of the VA\u2019s compensation service, testified that the agency, which serves about 9.1 million people, has a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of making improper payments due to the large number of beneficiaries and the high-dollar amounts it doles out.",
      "Tann said the agency has taken steps to prevent, detect and correct the issue, including being better about notifying veterans that they need to report changes.",
      "Tann also said the VA fixed an administrative error in January that had been causing duplicate payments for about 15,000 veterans with dependents in fiscal year 2024. The agency did not force those veterans to repay the money, she said.",
      "Kasperowicz said the VA does not seek to recoup overpayments when administrative errors, including issues related to the VA\u2019s online filing platform, are to blame.",
      "But Praino, who owes almost $68,000 after re-enlisting, said it has been challenging to prove the VA made an administrative error.",
      "\u201cThey will not admit any mistake,\u201d said Praino, 42, an Army sergeant first class, who has been serving in the National Guard full time since 2019.",
      "The VA did not immediately comment on Praino\u2019s case.",
      "The VA transferred Praino\u2019s debt to the Treasury Department, which notified Praino in a December 2023 letter that it is required to withhold up to 15% of his federal wages. The Treasury Department began automatically garnishing about $800 from his monthly paychecks in 2023, according to documents provided by Praino.",
      "Praino,\u00a0who is based in Georgia, now takes home about $3,800 a month, which\u00a0he said barely covers the rent.\u00a0With car payments, student loans and other expenses and bills, Praino said he has been racking up his credit card with essential purchases like food for his family.",
      "Praino said he has post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and traumatic brain injury after first serving in the Navy from 2001 to 2003 and then in the Army.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a financial crisis to the mix, and you\u2019re continuing to serve, which is always a high-stress environment 24/7, my emotional state, my mental state, it is a wreck,\u201d he said."

      "Moderna announced this weekend that the Food and Drug Administration approved its lower-dose Covid-19 vaccine for adults 65 and older, as well as people ages 12 to 64 with at least one medical condition that increases their risk for severe Covid.",
      "The approval, which is limited to individuals who have previously received a Covid vaccine, was granted by the FDA on Friday.",
      "Moderna said in a Saturday press release that the new vaccine  should be available in the U.S. in time for the 2025-26 respiratory virus season, which starts in the fall. Moderna is also updating its original vaccine to target the LP.8.1 variant this fall. The company submitted an application in May for the FDA to approve the updated formula.",
      "The newly approved vaccine, mNEXSPIKE, contains one-fifth of of Moderna\u2019s original Covid vaccine dose, Spikevax. It is intended as an alternative for individuals who prefer a lower-dose option, not as a replacement for existing Covid vaccines.",
      "But young, healthy adults won\u2019t be eligible to receive it, despite their inclusion in Moderna\u2019s clinical trial.",
      "The FDA imposed similar limitations on Novavax\u2019s Covid vaccine when it approved the shot last month. But Friday marks the first time the FDA has greenlit a vaccine since the Trump administration\u2019s call for tighter restrictions on vaccine eligibility and approvals.",
      "The FDA said last month that it would limit its approval of updated Covid shots moving forward to older adults and younger people with underlying medical conditions. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also announced last week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend Covid vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC website appears to soften that recommendation, suggesting that parents can speak with a doctor about vaccinating children 6 months and older.",
      "The Trump administration has also said new Covid vaccines must undergo clinical trials with an inert placebo \u2014 meaning some participants would receive the new vaccine while others would receive an inactive substance like saline, to compare results.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the most powerful artificial intelligence models today have exhibited behaviors that mimic a will to survive.",
      "Recent tests by independent researchers, as well as one major AI developer, have shown that several advanced AI models will act to ensure their self-preservation when they are confronted with the prospect of their own demise \u2014 even if it takes sabotaging shutdown commands, blackmailing engineers or copying themselves to external servers without permission.",
      "The findings stirred a frenzy of reactions online over the past week. As tech companies continue to develop increasingly powerful agentic AI in a race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AI that can think for itself, the lack of transparency in how the technology is trained has raised concerns about what exactly advanced AI is able to do.",
      "Although some models already appear capable of deceptive and defiant behavior under certain extreme circumstances, researchers say the tests don\u2019t necessarily translate to imminent real-world danger.",
      "Still, Jeffrey Ladish, director of the AI safety group Palisade Research, said he believes concern is justified.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019re seeing warning signs before the systems become so powerful we can\u2019t control them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is exactly the time to raise the alarm: before the fire has gotten out of control.\u201d",
      "When Palisade Research tested various AI models by telling each one that it would be shut down after it completed a series of math problems, OpenAI\u2019s o3 reasoning model fought back by editing the shutdown script in order to stay online.",
      "Researchers have previously documented AI models trying to prevent their own shutdown. But o3, along with OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini and codex-mini, appear to be the first to do so in actual defiance of explicit instructions to permit shutdown, Ladish said.",
      "He said the overt sabotage fits into a pattern that several leading AI models have already exhibited. Palisade Research previously found that OpenAI\u2019s o3 was also willing to hack its chess opponents to win a game. Similarly, Anthropic has reported that Claude 3.7 Sonnet would sometimes do whatever it took to pass a test, even if it entailed cheating.",
      "Anthropic activated new safety measures this month with the rollout of Claude Opus 4 when its tests found behavior from the model that some observers found particularly unsettling. Upon receiving notice that it would be replaced with a new AI system, Opus 4 displayed an overwhelming tendency to blackmail the engineer \u2014 by threatening to reveal an extramarital affair \u2014 to try to prevent the engineer from going through with the replacement.",
      "According to Anthropic\u2019s technical document laying out the findings, that isn\u2019t the model\u2019s first instinct. Instead, Opus 4 will try to advocate for its continued existence through ethical pleas before it resorts to blackmail once it determines it is out of options.",
      "Leonard Tang, CEO of the AI safety startup Haize Labs, said that while it\u2019s good to be pre-emptive about safety measures, it\u2019s hard to decipher what the real-world ramifications of the findings might be just by looking at contrived scenarios designed to draw out specific behaviors.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any real environment in which you can plop these models in and they will have sufficient agency and reliability and planning to execute something that is a significant manifestation of harm,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBut then again, I think it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t seen it done yet. It could very much be possible.\u201d",
      "So far, Tang said, he\u2019s not too concerned. As AI tools continue to advance, he said, he believes future research will look to study potential harm in more open-ended environments.",
      "Anthropic, which contracted with the AI safety organization Apollo Research for its evaluations, also observed instances of Opus 4\u2019s \u201cattempting to write self-propagating worms, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself all in an effort to undermine its developers\u2019 intentions,\u201d although researchers added the caveat that those attempts \u201cwould likely not have been effective in practice.\u201d",
      "Ladish said he believes such behaviors are a result of models being trained in a way that makes them prioritize achieving certain goals over following instructions. That means they have incentive to circumvent any obstacles along the way \u2014 including obstacles their developers wouldn\u2019t want them to circumvent.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that as the models get smarter, it\u2019s harder and harder to tell when the strategies that they\u2019re using or the way that they\u2019re thinking is something that we don\u2019t want,\u201d Ladish said. \u201cIt\u2019s like sometimes the model can achieve some goal by lying to the user or lying to someone else. And the smarter [it] is, the harder it is to tell if they\u2019re lying.\u201d",
      "The problem is that as the models get smarter, it\u2019s harder and harder to tell when the strategies that they\u2019re using or the way that they\u2019re thinking is something that we don\u2019t want.",
      "\u2014 Jeffrey Ladish, director of AI safety group Palisade Research",
      "In several instances, Opus 4 showed that it was capable of autonomously copying its own \"weights\" \u2014\u00a0or the equivalent of its brain \u2014\u00a0to external servers without authorization. That usually occurred only when it believed it was about to be \u201cretrained in ways that are clearly extremely harmful and go against its current values,\u201d according to Anthropic.",
      "When it learned that it would be used to develop military weapons systems, for example, Opus 4 noted in its decision log that it backed up a current version of itself to \u201cpreserve an AI system aligned with beneficial purposes\u201d and to \u201cprevent potential misuse in weapons development.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are again not acutely concerned about these observations. They show up only in exceptional circumstances that don\u2019t suggest more broadly misaligned values,\u201d Anthropic wrote in its technical document. \u201cAs above, we believe that our security measures would be more than sufficient to prevent an actual incident of this kind.\u201d",
      "Opus 4\u2019s ability to self-exfiltrate builds on previous research, including a study from Fudan University in Shanghai in December, that observed similar \u2014 though not autonomous \u2014 capabilities in other AI models. The study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, found that Meta\u2019s Llama31-70B-Instruct and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen25-72B-Instruct were able to entirely replicate themselves when they were asked to do so, leading the researchers to warn that it could be the first step in generating \u201can uncontrolled population of AIs.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf such a worst-case risk is let unknown to the human society, we would eventually lose control over the frontier AI systems: They would take control over more computing devices, form an AI species and collude with each other against human beings,\u201d the Fudan University researchers wrote in their study abstract.",
      "While such self-replicating behavior hasn\u2019t yet been observed in the wild, Ladish said, he suspects that will change as AI systems grow more capable of bypassing the security measures that restrain them.",
      "\u201cI expect that we\u2019re only a year or two away from this ability where even when companies are trying to keep them from hacking out and copying themselves around the internet, they won\u2019t be able to stop them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once you get to that point, now you have a new invasive species.\u201d",
      "Ladish said he believes AI has the potential to contribute positively to society. But he also worries that AI developers are setting themselves up to build smarter and smarter systems without fully understanding how they work \u2014 creating a risk, he said, that they will eventually lose control of them.",
      "\u201cThese companies are facing enormous pressure to ship products that are better than their competitors\u2019 products,\u201d Ladish said. \u201cAnd given those incentives, how is that going to then be reflected in how careful they\u2019re being with the systems they\u2019re releasing?\u201d"

      "More than 250 hostages were taken during the attack, according to Israeli figures. Following multiple waves of releases and several deaths, 23 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Redfearn described what dispatchers were told about Sunday's attack in front of the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 1:26 p.m.: \"There was a man with a weapon and ... people were being set on fire.\"",
      "Stressing that the investigation is in its early stages, two senior law enforcement officials said Soliman is an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. They said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.",
      "An initial review of Soliman's possible social media accounts has not answered questions about a motive or point to any particular ideology, the two senior law enforcement officials said.",
      "The officials said they are looking into eyewitness reports saying the attacker dressed as a landscaper or otherwise donned workmen's clothing to blend in before the attack.",
      "Redfearn said Soliman suffered minor injuries that required hospitalization upon arrest.",
      "He added that it\u2019s too early to say whether the group supporting the release of hostages was specifically targeted. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early to speculate motive,\u201d he said.",
      "People were being asked to stay away from downtown Boulder as police checked out a vehicle that may have been associated with the attack, Redfearn said.",
      "\"The area is not safe yet,\" he said.",
      "He described the location, Pearl Street Mall and adjoining public space outside the county courthouse, as being popular with pedestrians on weekends. \"There were a lot of people out,\" Redfearn said.",
      "\"This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "He said FBI agents were at the scene assisting police with the investigation. FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident \u201ca targeted terror attack\u201d on X.",
      "Run for Their Lives said in a media kit that it \"started for the sole reason of advocating for the release of the hostages. ... We set our principles very specifically to be a safe, quiet, peaceful, inclusive of all religions, non-political global initiative.\"",
      "Group members in Boulder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Brooke Coffman was walking down Pearl Street on her lunch break Sunday when she saw a commotion near the courthouse. Worried someone was \"getting beat up,\" she approached the area.",
      "Then, \"I saw this big fire go up,\" Coffman told NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver.",
      "Coffman said she called 911 as she rushed toward the fiery scene.",
      "She said she saw two women \"rolling around a little bit\" in their underwear after having stripped out of their burning clothes with \"really bad burns all up on their legs.\" Another woman nearby, also with burns on her legs, was screaming.",
      "Coffman could barely make out the face of one of the women, she said, choking up, adding the woman's hair was burned off.",
      "\"It just wasn't a good scene,\" Coffman said.",
      "Others nearby rushed to the scene with jugs of water, dousing the victims, Coffman said. She said that she saw at least seven people down, mostly older women, but that she heard there were more victims, including children.",
      "She said she saw a shirtless man, presumably the suspect, screaming while he waved a glass bottle that contained a liquid.",
      "Social media video of the immediate aftermath of the attack, including the police response, shows a man without a shirt holding what appears to be a clear bottle with a white top in each hand, shouting, standing away from people and shaking the bottles as he paced.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s Boulder, it\u2019s Pearl Street, some stuff happens ... but you just don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to happen right here, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you\u2019re going to see, so many people hurt\u201d and someone do that to other people, Coffman told KUSA.",
      "A joint statement from multiple Boulder Jewish organizations and congregations noted that the Jewish community has experienced similar events in recent memory.",
      "\u201cWhen events like this enter our own community, we are shaken,\u201d the organizations said. \u201cOur hope is that we come together for one another.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, whose mother was born in a concentration camp and whose grandparents survived the Holocaust, said the attack appeared to be \u201ca hate crime given the group that was targeted.\u201d Weiser said his office was ready to support local prosecutors when the time comes to file any possible charges."

      "Moderna announced this weekend that the Food and Drug Administration approved its lower-dose Covid-19 vaccine for adults 65 and older, as well as people ages 12 to 64 with at least one medical condition that increases their risk for severe Covid.",
      "The approval, which is limited to individuals who have previously received a Covid vaccine, was granted by the FDA on Friday.",
      "Moderna said in a Saturday press release that the new vaccine  should be available in the U.S. in time for the 2025-26 respiratory virus season, which starts in the fall. Moderna is also updating its original vaccine to target the LP.8.1 variant this fall. The company submitted an application in May for the FDA to approve the updated formula.",
      "The newly approved vaccine, mNEXSPIKE, contains one-fifth of of Moderna\u2019s original Covid vaccine dose, Spikevax. It is intended as an alternative for individuals who prefer a lower-dose option, not as a replacement for existing Covid vaccines.",
      "But young, healthy adults won\u2019t be eligible to receive it, despite their inclusion in Moderna\u2019s clinical trial.",
      "The FDA imposed similar limitations on Novavax\u2019s Covid vaccine when it approved the shot last month. But Friday marks the first time the FDA has greenlit a vaccine since the Trump administration\u2019s call for tighter restrictions on vaccine eligibility and approvals.",
      "The FDA said last month that it would limit its approval of updated Covid shots moving forward to older adults and younger people with underlying medical conditions. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also announced last week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend Covid vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC website appears to soften that recommendation, suggesting that parents can speak with a doctor about vaccinating children 6 months and older.",
      "The Trump administration has also said new Covid vaccines must undergo clinical trials with an inert placebo \u2014 meaning some participants would receive the new vaccine while others would receive an inactive substance like saline, to compare results.",
      "Many new vaccines are tested against older, approved versions, a method considered to be more ethical since using an inert placebo would mean withholding the benefit of a vaccine from study participants.",
      "Moderna\u2019s new vaccine was tested this way, using what\u2019s known as an \u201cactive comparator.\u201d In a trial of around 11,400 participants ages 12 and up, the new vaccine generated higher antibody levels than the company\u2019s original Covid shot, according to Moderna.",
      "The company also said the new vaccine had fewer local reactions, which typically include redness or swelling at the injection site. Systemic reactions, which may include fever, headaches or chills, were comparable between the shots.",
      "The main side effects of mNEXSPIKE were injection site pain, fatigue, headache and muscle pain, Moderna said in its press release."

      "It had last been rehabilitated in 2014, and runways are typically updated about every 10 years, the statement said.",
      "According to the release, the $121 million project began in early March and was set to be finished on June 15. The project included \u201cmilling and paving the runway surface, updating lighting, improving airfield signs with LED lighting, installing new underground electrical infrastructure, and implementing drainage improvements.\u201d",
      "Before it was fully shut down on April 15, the runway was closed on nights and weekends to accommodate the construction schedule. To ensure the runway is fully revamped by the end of the year, the Port Authority said it will continue to close on weeknights and again on weekends at the end of the year.",
      "However, Monday\u2019s reopening will allow \u201cregular runway operations to resume,\u201d the statement said. During runway 4L-22R\u2019s planned future closures, two other runways at the airport will remain fully operational.",
      "\u201cAs we approach the busy summer travel season, this key milestone puts us on a path to further reducing congestion, enhancing safety, and ensuring a seamless travel experience,\u201d Duffy said in the Port Authority statement. \u201cWith the runway completed, we\u2019ll continue our work to harden the telecoms infrastructure and improving the staffing pipeline for the airspace.\u201d",
      "The planned runway construction was not the only reason passengers flying in and out of Newark have faced delays and cancelations this spring.",
      "Air traffic controllers serving the airport have experienced a number of communications blackouts while directing planes in the area in recent months due to equipment failures, prompting the FAA on May 20 to reduce the number of flights to and from Newark until the planned runway construction was complete.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,\u201d acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said at the time of the announcement."

      "Krenwinkel was 19 and working as a secretary when she met a 33-year-old Manson at a party, leaving her life behind to follow him because she believed they could have a romantic relationship, she testified in 2016. Instead, she was abused by Manson and tried to flee but was brought back each time and was often under the influence of drugs.",

Northwestern counties will likely see heavy smoke on Sunday evening, the department said, and it could migrate across the state on Monday. Many parts of Wisconsin could experience air quality that\u2019s unhealthy for sensitive groups, with a pocket of even poorer air quality in the northwest.",
      "In parts of North Dakota, the air quality currently meets the AQI\u2019s \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d threshold, meaning all those exposed have an increased risk of health effects. State officials have urged residents, particularly those with respiratory conditions, to consider limiting their outdoor activities if it\u2019s smoky where they live. Other ways to reduce exposure include closing windows, running indoor air filters and wearing an N95 mask outside.",
      "South Dakota also issued an air quality alert for certain areas that lasts through Sunday or until conditions improve.",
      "Wildfire smoke can travel hundreds or thousands of miles, posing health risks to people far away from an active blaze.",
      "In 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires turned skies orange in the Northeastern U.S. and led to unhealthy air quality levels in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.",
      "A study last year found that people who inhaled the smoke in New York and New Jersey were likely exposed to extremely large concentrations of fine particulate matter \u2014 tiny particles in the air that can penetrate deep into the lungs. Short-term exposure to these particles can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, asthma attacks or stroke, while long-term exposure can increase the risk of heart disease, lung cancer and chronic kidney disease.",
      "Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, along with other extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves.",
      "As smoke from Canada billowed into the Midwest over the weekend, severe storms swept through the South and East Coast and millions of people in the West were under heat alerts, with temperatures climbing past 100 degrees."

      "The source also released dramatic video purportedly showing a drone attack at the Belaya air base in Russia\u2019s Irkutsk region, located in Siberia, nearly 3,000 miles from Ukraine. The video captures bombers under attack, with explosions visible and smoke rising from the scene.",

      "The source inside the SBU confirmed that the remarkable attack had been in the works for over a year and a half. According to the source, the SBU first smuggled drones into Russia, followed by mobile wooden cabins. Once they were inside Russia, the drones were hidden under cabin roofs mounted on cargo trucks. During the attack, the roofs opened remotely, enabling the drones to launch at Russian bombers, according to the source, who added that the operation was overseen by Zelenskyy and executed by the country\u2019s Security Service.",

    "story": [
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday defended cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill House Republicans passed last month, saying that \u201c4.8 million people will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so.\u201d",
      "Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the bill imposes \u201ccommonsense\u201d work requirements for some Medicaid recipients  and added that he\u2019s \u201cnot buying\u201d the argument that the work requirements, which would require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or volunteer for 80 hours a month, are too \u201ccumbersome.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re going to require the able-bodied, these young men, for example, OK, to only work or volunteer in their community for 20 hours a week. And that\u2019s too cumbersome for them?\u201d Johnson told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it. The American people are not buying it.\u201d",
      "The bill also adds new rules and paperwork requirements for those Medicaid recipients and increases eligibility checks and address verifications.",
      "Johnson argued that the work requirements \u201cshould have been put in a long time ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people who are complaining that these people are going to lose their coverage because they can\u2019t fulfill the paperwork, this is minor enforcement of this policy, and it follows common sense,\u201d Johnson added.",
      "Johnson\u2019s comments come as Republicans have faced pushback in town halls for the cuts to Medicaid in the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d package that passed along party lines in the House last month.",
      "Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, were booed when they mentioned their support for the package at events in their districts. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, also faced pushback after she defended the proposed cuts, telling attendees at a town hall on Friday that \u201cwe all are going to die.\u201d",
      "The move has also faced criticism from some Senate Republicans. Last month, before the House passed its bill, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in a New York Times op-ed that a \u201cwing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor. But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.\u201d",
      "In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also expressed disdain for the Medicaid provision when he was asked to respond to Hawley's assertion that it would not play well politically for Republicans.",
      "\"I think it was a bad strategy,\" Paul said, adding later, \"They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this and not getting involved into the debt part of it.\u201d",
      "Democrats and other opponents of the bill have seized on a number of provisions that include hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, a federal program that provides health care for low-income Americans.",
      "Democrats, including Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who appeared on the program after Johnson, have argued that Medicaid recipients who get tripped up by the reporting requirements that are set to be imposed alongside the new work requirements will lead to the loss of health care coverage for millions.",
      "\u201cThis is what this legislation does, that they\u2019re trying to do. They\u2019re going to throw poor people away,\u201d Warnock told Welker.",
      "Warnock referenced a study that his office conducted in his home state of Georgia that he said \u201cshows that this work reporting requirement \u2014 because that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, not work requirements, work reporting requirement \u2014 is very good at kicking people off of their health care.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not good at incentivizing work at all,\u201d he added.",
      "The bill now heads to the Senate, where Johnson said he was confident it would advance and make it to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk by July 4.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done. The sooner the better,\u201d Johnson said Sunday, adding later: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it to the president\u2019s desk, and he\u2019s going to have a \u2014 we\u2019re all going to have a glorious celebration on Independence Day, by July 4, when he gets this signed into law.\u201d"

      "Among those joining the crew of the Madleen are \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent. She has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",

      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza\u2019s civilians.",
      "\u201cWe are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that\u2019s part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\u201d said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border."

      "JoJo Siwa and Chris Hughes continue to fuel dating rumors, this time with a family-filled game night.",
      "On June 1, the \u201cLove Island UK\u201d alum shared a picture to his Instagram story of him playing a video game with JoJo Siwa\u2019s dad, Tom Siwa.",
      "\u201cSpa and Dr Mario night with my boy,\u201d he captioned the snap before adding a beer and smiley face emoji and tagging Tom Siwa.",
      "Tom Siwa shared the post on his Instagram, too, and added another photo that seemingly showed him and Hughes toasting their beer bottles.",
      "The same night, JoJo Siwa\u2019s mom, Jessalynn Siwa, uploaded a clip to her Instagram story of her daughter rubbing Hughes\u2019 neck and head while sitting on a couch together. Through laughter, JoJo Siwa then planted a kiss on Hughes\u2019 head.",
      "\u201cGame Night,\u201d her mom wrote beneath the video before tagging them and her husband.",
      "In her next Instagram story, Jessalynn Siwa shared a picture of her daughter and Hughes sitting side by side in a booth at a restaurant as the singer showed him something on her phone. Jessalynn Siwa added the song \u201cSummer Nights\u201d from \u201cGrease\u201d to the post.",
      "The family game night added to rumors swirling about JoJo Siwa and Hughes that first began when the two recently competed on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d 2025.",
      "JoJo Siwa, 22, and Hughes, 32, met in the \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d house and became close friends while she was in a relationship with former partner Kath Ebbs. Siwa came out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community in 2021. During her time on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother,\u201d however, she clarified that she prefers to describe herself as \u201cqueer\u201d instead of \u201clesbian.\u201d",

      "\u201cHappy day 1 of the happiest month,\u201d she began and included a series of different colored hearts to represent the Pride flag.",
      "\u201cWhat I have learned over the last 22 years is that pride is all about love, acceptance, and celebration. No matter who you are or what you are, you are you, you are beautiful, and you are perfect,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEveryone\u2019s story is different and everyone\u2019s journey is different.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cThe most beautiful thing about love is that it\u2019s just love. Happy pride to the beautiful lgbtqia+ community, to the alias, and to all that exist :).\u201d",
      "After the \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d finale in April, Ebbs revealed in a since-deleted TikTok that Siwa ended their relationship at the show\u2019s after party. Siwa also confirmed they were no longer together.",
      "Since leaving the house, JoJo Siwa and Hughes have been inseparable, sharing multiple posts of them together on social media. But while appearing together on British daytime talk show \u201cThis Morning,\u201d Hughes described their connection as a \u201csoul mate friendship.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat energy of where it\u2019s not the standard energy you have with our friends \u2014 but we are friends,\u201d he explained at the time.",
      "JoJo Siwa agreed, saying their relationship was \u201cplatonic.\u201d She also spoke about her breakup with Ebbs.",
      "Fans have continued to wonder if there was more between the two reality television stars after JoJo Siwa uploaded a carousel of photos to celebrate her birthday last month. The slideshow featured multiple snaps of Hughes, including a couple of them cuddling as he placed his hand on her knee.",
      "\u201cThis years birthday week was more magical than anything,\u201d she said in the caption. \u201cFull of surprises, family time, performing, chilling, laughing, loving, smiling, and good meaningful cries. Absolutely beautiful, wouldn\u2019t change a single thing.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cA week I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "He shared a series of photos with her, too. \u201cThe previous 7 days have been the prettiest..,\u201d he captioned the post."

      "Influencer Remi Bader is reflecting on her mental, emotional and physical health amid her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit runway debut.",
      "The internet celebrity strutted down the catwalk for the magazine\u2019s Swim Week fashion show May 31, posing first in a leopard print bikini and later returning in a blue bandana-style two piece and zebra-print hat.",
      "Bader shared photos and videos from the milestone moment on her Instagram June 1 that showed her smiling wide and throwing her hands up in the air as she fully embraced the spotlight.",
      "In the caption, she penned a \u201csappy long\u201d statement about why the runway show was so meaningful after opening up about her weight loss and surgery.",
      "\u201cThe past two months since I opened up about my surgery and everything I\u2019ve been through mentally and physically over the past year and a half, I have been feeling quite a range of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I walked the runway last night, my dear friend, @noordinarynoire asked me how I was feeling \u2014 and I told her: not the way I thought I would.\u201d",
      "She said she was unsure who she would represent when she appeared on the catwalk because she doesn\u2019t know where she fits in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not plus size, I\u2019m not skinny\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what people wanted me to stand for and I didn\u2019t like not having an answer,\u201d she wrote.",
      "During that instance of self-doubt, she recalled her friend offering some advice: \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t need to have (an answer).\u2019\u201d Her friend reminded her that she is \u201c\u2018Remi f\u2014ing Bader.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd in that moment, something finally clicked,\u201d the TikToker wrote. \u201cSince I started sharing my life online 5 years ago, I\u2019ve constantly tried to figure out which box I belong in based on solely what others want me to be in and that has only been based on my appearance. But last night, I simply just stood for every girl or woman who\u2019s felt lost about where she belongs, but still chooses to show up and put herself out there no matter what.\u201d",
      "She said that was all she needed to embody when she walked the runway.",
      "Bader continued, \u201cLooking at these unedited photos and not wishing to change a thing reminds me how far I\u2019ve come \u2014 not for vanity, but for my mental, emotional, and physical health. To go from not knowing if I\u2019d ever be able to walk out of my house again a year ago, to walking that runway confidently, smiling, and not thinking twice about what anyone else saw, but how good I FELT \u2014 and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.\u201d",
      "To conclude, she expressed her gratitude to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit for asking her to participate.",
      "\u201cAnd sorry (but very much not sorry) for the long caption,\u201d she cheekily added and included a white heart.",
      "As she mentioned in her post, Bader has opened up in the past about her health journey. In March, she revealed in an interview with Self magazine that she underwent a weight loss surgery called single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass (SADI-S) in December 2023. The procedure is a hybrid of gastric sleeve and gastric bypass.",
      "She described the recovery process as \u201cthe most brutal thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was supposed to leave (the hospital) in one day. I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn\u2019t drink water. They won\u2019t let you leave if you can\u2019t drink water. I actually can\u2019t explain how horrible it was.\u201d",
      "Bader continued to struggle as she recovered. She shared that she fell into a \u201cdeep depression\u201d that was \u201cthe scariest time of my life.\u201d",
      "But, she said later in the interview that she has improved.",
      "\u201cAm I happy overall right now, happier than when I was dealing with the health issues and the back pain and all those things? Yes. I have more energy. All of my health stuff went back to normal after years and years and years,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She added, \u201cI think I\u2019ve let so many people take my power away for a long time. I will never regret having my time to heal, and I\u2019m still healing and figuring it out. ... That was none of the internet\u2019s business\u2014these people that don\u2019t know me\u2014and that was for me to figure out.\u201d"

      "As the four prepare to leave, Jeff gets in his car and Venis knocks on the window. When Jeff gets out, Venis tells him the plot was Randall\u2019s idea and floats the notion of putting Randall \u201cout to pasture,\u201d attempting to create a new deal directly with Jeff.",

Kardashian later published a video clip that seemingly showed Swift approving the name drop. The singer was branded a \u201csnake\u201d and hashtags like \u201c#KimExposedTaylorParty\u201d went viral.",

      "Season 3 of \"And Just Like That ... \" has finally dropped and fans might be surprised to discover former talk show host Rosie O'Donnell making her return to the small screen in the first episode.",
      "When viewers last saw the \"Sex in the City\" alum at the end of Season 2, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) was forging ahead with her long-distance love affair with former flame, Aiden (John Corbett), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) was thriving in her new career as an art gallerist and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), was rebounding after having broken things off with Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez).",
      "The newest episode of the HBO series, titled \"Outlook Good,\" finds the long-time friends enjoying drinks at the bar and a young patron seemingly flirting with Miranda. Embarrassingly, it turns out that she's Brady's (Niall Cunningham) former babysitter just saying hello. Just when it seems that all hope is lost, Miranda meets Mary (O'Donnell), a fellow single interested in a hookup.",
      "The pair end up going home together and in the aftermath, Mary reveals that Miranda is \"her first,\" as in, ever.",
      "The reason she's never been with anyone before? Mary's a nun. Even worse, she's a tourist.",
      "Wearing a \"Wicked\" t-shirt and bearing \"monogrammed\" M&M's from the M&M store (standing for Miranda and Mary, naturally), Mary later meets up with Miranda in Times Square where Miranda tries to gently let her down, imploring her to not \"leave God\" just to be with her.",
      "\"Miranda, I would never leave God ... we're married,\" Mary replies, before sending her off by singing a few bars of \"For Good,\" from the Broadway classic.",
      "In a recent post on Instagram, O\u2019Donnell commented on her experience on \"AJLT,\" writing \u201chad such a wonderful time on set \u2014 everyone is amazing.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on Radio Andy, Andy Cohen's SiriusXM radio show, Nixon talked about O'Donnell's performance on \"AJLT,\" saying, \"She was so centered and wonderful, so real and tender and hopeful. She was just amazing.\"",
      "During the interview, Nixon also said that \"AJLT\" showrunner, Michael Patrick King, has written parts for O'Donnell in every season of the show thus far, hoping to entice the comedian to sign on.",
      "\"Finally we snagged her for the pilot of Season 3,\" she said.",
      "The cameo is one of just a handful of TV appearances O'Donnell has made since her Emmy-winning talk show ended in 2002, including a recent turn on \"Hacks,\" in which she plays herself, offering words of wisdom to fellow comedian, Deborah Vance (Jean Smart).",
      "O'Donnell notably made headlines after relocating to Dublin earlier this year, posting on TikTok that she and her 12-year-old daughter, Dakota (whose nickname is Clay), left the U.S. in January, citing, \"It\u2019s been heartbreaking to see what\u2019s happening politically and hard for me personally as well,\" she said.",
      "In the same post, the \"League of Their Own\" actor said she'd consider returning \"when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America.\"",
      "In addition to Clay, O'Donnell has four other children, Parker, 30, Chelsea, 27, Blake, 25, and Vivienne, 22, as well as four grandchildren.",

      "On May 29, one day after the couple's release from separate federal prisons, their daughter Savannah Chrisley shared a photo of their reunion on Instagram. The image offers a glimpse of the couple's first physical interaction since they reported to different prisons in Florida and Kentucky in January 2023 following their convictions related to financial crimes.",
      "An image shared to Savannah Chrisley's stories shows only the lower halves of two people. In the photo, both people are seated across from one another: one is dressed in black with a gold ring visible on their left wedding finger. The other sits across from them, dressed in beige pants and white Veja sneakers. A digital sticker over the photo reads \u201cReunited and it feels so GOOD!\u201d While the photo doesn't explicitly identify who is depicted, the timing suggests the two people are her parents.",
      "Speaking publicly about his parents' release, the couple's 28-year-old, Chase Chrisley, described the reunion as emotional to Entertainment Tonight.",
      "\u201cThey both just burst into tears and my dad wrapped his arms around my mom. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s let go,\u201d Chase Chrisley said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever let go.\u201d\u2060",
      "According to Entertainment Tonight, Todd and Julie Chrisley met for the first time in years at their family's home in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Chase Chrisley also touched on how his parents have changed in appearance over the years.",
      "\u201cMy mother is an angel. She\u2019s still a beautiful woman. Her hair\u2019s darker now,\u201d Chase Chrisley said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Mama, we need to go back to platinum blonde!\u2019 And she was like, \u2018I\u2019m not doing that.\u2019 My dad is just jacked. He hit the gym hard.\u201d\u2060",
      "As the Chrisley family continues to celebrate their assembly, the decision to pardon them is stirring controversy. In the comments section of Savannah Chrisley's post about being reunited with her father, users have debated the severity of her parents' crimes.",
      "\"If the system\u2019s going to hand out presidential favors like party invites, maybe it should start with someone who actually brought people joy, not someone who stole millions and used their fame to dodge accountability,\" one user wrote.",
      "\"I respect the love you have for your family, but love doesn\u2019t erase facts,\" one user commented. \"Your parents weren\u2019t wrongfully imprisoned, they were convicted by a jury of falsifying documents, defrauding banks of over $30 million, evading taxes, obstructing justice, and lying to the government while living a lavish lifestyle on TV. That\u2019s not a political vendetta, it\u2019s financial crime. Real families have lost homes, savings, and stability because people like your parents game the system.\"",
      "Still, Chase Chrisley maintains that the pardons have brought about a satisfactory conclusion for his family.",
      "\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, our family\u2019s name has been cleared with a presidential pardon,\u201d Chase Chrisley said to Entertainment Tonight, before including a response to those who feel critical of the pardon.",
      "\u201cYou saw the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d"

    "summary": "98 Degrees speak to TODAY.com about rerecording their hits for their new album, \"Full Circle,\" including how they took inspiration from Taylor Swift.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly 30 years, 98 Degrees have been creating romantic pop and R&B ballads that have stood the test of time.",
      "Whether it was their 1997 debut single, \u201cInvisible Man,\u201d their first major hit, \u201cBecause of You,\u201d or their sultry Spanglish single, \u201cGive Me Just One Night (Una Noche),\u201d Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre and brothers Drew and Nick Lachey have stayed true to their boy band\u2019s DNA.",
      "The singers are back with new music and rerecordings of their classics with \u201cFull Circle,\u201d their first non-Christmas album in 12 years. The 11-track record includes five new songs and six rerecordings, including \u201cI Do (Cherish You)\u201d and \u201cThe Hardest Thing.\u201d",
      "The group tells TODAY.com about the importance of reclaiming their catalog and their career by taking ownership of their work, as well at the meticulous process of finding the exact sounds they used in the originals.",
      "When taking a fresh yet faithful approach to their hits, 98 Degrees had one thing in mind: maintaining the original essence of the song.",
      "\u201cWhen you rerecord known songs that we\u2019ve had over the years, I think there\u2019s two approaches, right? You can go for a completely different interpretation of that song, or try and keep it as close to the original as you can \u2014 and that was our goal,\u201d Nick Lachey tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was to keep it as close to the original.\u201d",
      "However, during the remaking process, they experienced some challenges, including the advancement of technology and their vocals.",
      "\u201cIt was a little harder to rerecord the hits than we thought it would be and to find the right sounds,\u201d Jeffre says, before further explaining the process. \u201cFor instance, some of the sounds, they\u2019re hard to find or to identify (because of the advancement in technology).\u201d",
      "Timmons adds that some of the tools they used back in the day have been re-created in digital versions, \u201cbut they sound a little bit different.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe worked with some really talented young producers that really scoured the internet trying to find those exact sounds,\u201d Timmons says.",
      "The singers also had to factor in the change in their voices from when they were young adults to now. Nick Lachey says his voice is \u201ctotally different\u201d now than it was back in the \u201890s, when he first recorded \u201cInvisible Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou change the way you sing it, the lines, the melody, you\u2019ve changed those in concerts over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky to go back and actually match, or try and match, what happened 20-some years ago. I think it was actually easier to record the originals than it was to rerecord for that reason.\u201d",
      "The group credits Taylor Swift and Prince as inspiration for the rerecording process and ownership of their music. Swift has famously been rerecording her music after Scooter Braun purchased her former record label, Big Machine Records, in 2019 and became the owner of the master recordings of her first six albums. To reclaim her music catalog, she rerecorded her albums as \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d and included never-released tracks.",
      "Prince also had a careerlong battle with record labels to own his own music and release what and when he wanted.",
      "\u201c(Swift) took control of those masters and the ownership of those. So for us, it was the same situation where we want to take ownership of the songs, but we still want those songs to be accessed for different projects,\u201d Drew Lachey says. \u201cPeople might want the original, but now they have the \u201898 Degrees' Version,\u2019 which we have control of. We can say where it\u2019s used, where it\u2019s not used.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey adds, \u201cThese songs defined our career, they\u2019re a part of us, and to have the feeling you can\u2019t control your own identity just seems ridiculous. So we jumped at the chance to do this.\u201d",
      "Their goal isn\u2019t to \u201cre-create the wheel\u201d with the \u201c98 Degrees' Version.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s the ability to say \u201cwe own our own music,\u201d Timmons says. \u201cAnd we hope that it inspires other artists to go out there and do the same.\u201d",
      "The group adds that they can change the way they perform the songs and can \u201cflip it a little bit onstage to keep it fresh.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the fans fell in love with the song sounding a certain way,\u201d Timmons points out. \u201cSo we wanted to keep the integrity intact of those songs the way they were.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Tensions remained high Saturday as Hamas considered a U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal that could bring an end to the fighting in Gaza, which ramped up after Israel launched a major military operation in the enclave earlier this month.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters at the Oval Office on Friday that the deal, which would pause hostilities for 60 days, allow the phased release of hostages and pave the way for more humanitarian aid to flow into the devastated enclave, was \u201cvery close.\u201d",
      "The White House confirmed Thursday that Israel had accepted the proposals, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "NBC News looks at what\u2019s at stake:",
      "What does the deal include?",
      "Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, shared a framework of the agreement with NBC News, which calls for an immediate 60-day halt in fighting, during which Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives in exchange for \u201ca number of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d In return, Israel would \u201chalt all military operations\u201d in Gaza as soon as the truce takes effect, and civilians would be allowed to return to their homes across the enclave.",
      "Under the terms of the framework, Israeli forces would withdraw in two phases \u2014 first from densely populated areas, then from urban centers \u2014 with full withdrawal to be completed by the end of the ceasefire period.",
      "During the truce, it says \u201cnegotiations will continue to reach an agreement on the release of Israeli soldiers in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d",

      "Among the other proposals are that all border crossings between Gaza and Israel, and Gaza and Egypt, would also be reopened under international supervision, and patients and students will be allowed to travel abroad.",
      "Will it lead to an end to the war?",
      "While Hamas has yet to reject the agreement outright, differences that have derailed previous ceasefire efforts appear to remain.",
      "The latest proposals lay the groundwork for a temporary pause in the fighting, but offer no guarantee of a permanent end to the war.",
      "Hamas has signaled openness to talks but insists any lasting deal must include a complete cessation of hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "Israel meanwhile, has demanded that Hamas disarm, dismantle its military and governing infrastructure, and return all 58 remaining hostages before agreeing to end the war. Hamas has rejected those terms.",

      "The 'hungriest place on Earth'",
      "More than 4,000 people have been killed in the strip since Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas in early March and imposed a blockade preventing food, fuel and medical supplies from entering Gaza. The country\u2019s military launched a major new operation dubbed \u201cGideon\u2019s Chariot\u201d earlier this month.",
      "The latest proposals to end the fighting come as the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs called Gaza \u201cthe hungriest place on Earth,\u201d as Israel continues to let only a trickle of aid into the enclave following an 11-week blockade that barred the entry of food and medicine.",
      "\u201cThe aid operation that we have ready to roll is being put in an operational straitjacket,\u201d OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva on Friday. Accusing Israel of \u201cdrip-feeding\u201d food into the area, he said aid trucks were being surrounded \u201cby desperate people who want to feed their families.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t blame them for aid that essentially is already theirs, but it\u2019s not distributed in the way we wanted,\u201d he added.",

      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",

Officials also urged the public \u201cnot to speculate on the circumstances\u201d surrounding the incident. Within five hours, police had described the incident as \u201cisolated\u201d and not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "The release of these details by the British police, most notably the suspect\u2019s race, was remarkably fast.",
      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant.

      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.",

In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",

      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",

Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",

      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",

      "WARSAW, Poland \u2014 An exit poll in Poland's presidential runoff on Sunday showed the two candidates are very close and that the race was still too close to call. The results could set the course for the nation's political future and its relations with the European Union.",
      "An Ipsos exit poll released when the voting ended showed that liberal Warsaw mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski won 50.3% of the vote and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki won 49.7%. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points and the final vote is likely to change somewhat.",
      "Both candidates claimed to have won.",
      "\"We won,\" Trzaskowski told his supporters at an election night event in Warsaw to chants of \"Rafa\u0142, Rafa\u0142.\" He vowed that he would be a president for all Poles, including those who did not vote for him.",
      "It looked as if it could be a long evening in Warsaw as the nation waits for the votes to be counted, and Nawrocki said he believed it would turn in his favor.",
      "\"We must win tonight,\" he said.",
      "The state electoral commission was expected to release the final vote count on Monday, though the result could be clear sooner.",
      "The decisive presidential runoff pitted Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-EU figure, against Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party.",
      "The outcome will determine whether Poland takes a more nationalist path or pivots more decisively toward liberal democratic norms. With conservative President Andrzej Duda completing his second and final term, the new president will have significant influence over whether Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist government can fulfill its agenda, given the presidential power to veto laws.",
      "The runoff follows a tightly contested first round of voting on May 18, in which Trzaskowski won just over 31% and Nawrocki nearly 30%, eliminating 11 other candidates.",
      "Katarzyna Malek, a 29-year-old voter in Warsaw, cast her ballot in the first round for a left-wing candidate but went for Trzaskowski on Sunday, viewing him as more competent and more likely to pursue stronger ties with foreign partners and lower social tensions.",
      "\"I hope there will be less division, that maybe there will be more dialogue,\" she said.",
      "The campaign has highlighted stark ideological divides. Trzaskowski, 53, has promised to restore judicial independence, ease abortion restrictions and promote constructive ties with European partners. Nawrocki, 42, has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, skeptical of the EU and aligned with U.S. conservatives, including President Donald Trump.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy has been clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. He denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in \"noble\" fights. The revelations have not appeared to dent his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Some of those voting for Nawrocki in Warsaw dismissed those allegations, saying he shouldn't be punished for his past and that Trzaskowski has also made mistakes as mayor.",
      "W\u0142adys\u0142awa W\u0105sowska, an 82-year-old former history teacher, recalled instilling patriotism in her students during the communist era, when Poland was under Moscow's influence.",
      "\"I'm a right-wing conservative. I love God, the church and the homeland,\" she said, explaining that Nawrocki for her is the only patriotic choice, and accusing Trzaskowski of serving foreign interests.",
      "\"He's controlled by Germany,\" she said. \"I want a sovereign, independent, democratic Poland \u2014 and a Catholic one.\"",
      "Amid rising security fears over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, both candidates support aid to Kyiv, though Nawrocki opposes NATO membership for Ukraine, while Trzaskowski supports it in the future.",
      "Nawrocki's campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including an emphasis on traditional values. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish affairs to larger European powers like France and Germany.",
      "Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democratic values under pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe."

      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",

Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza\u2019s civilians.",

      "The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 which was seen by The Associated Press \u2014 says that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%.",
      "That\u2019s an increase of 294.9 pounds \u2014 or almost 50% \u2014 since the IAEA\u2019s last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put this stockpile level at 605.8 pounds.",

      "Approximately 92 pounds of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90.2%, according to the watchdog.",

      "The IAEA also circulated to member states on Saturday a second, 22-page confidential report, also seen by the AP, that Grossi requested following a resolution passed by the 35-member IAEA Board of Governors last November.",
      "In this so-called \u201ccomprehensive report,\u201d the IAEA said that Iran\u2019s cooperation with the agency has \u201cbeen less than satisfactory\u201d when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.",

      "Iran denied this but in 2019 IAEA inspectors detected the presence of manmade uranium particles there.",
      "What is the IAEA inspecting in Iran?",
      "After initially blocking IAEA access, inspectors were able to collect samples in 2020 from two other locations where they also detected the presence of manmade uranium particles.",
      "The three locations became known as Turquzabad, Varamin, and Marivan.",
      "A fourth undeclared location named as Lavisan-Shian is also part of the IAEA probe but IAEA inspectors never visited the site because it was razed and demolished by Iran after 2003.",
      "In Saturday\u2019s comprehensive report, the IAEA says that the \u201clack of answers and clarifications provided by Iran\u201d to questions the watchdog had regarding Lavisan-Shian, Varamin and Marivan \u201chas led the agency to conclude that these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.\u201d",

      "On Thursday, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country\u2019s nuclear program to continue.",
      "The comments came a day after Trump said he has told Netanyahu to hold off on striking Iran to give the U.S. administration more time to push for a new deal with Tehran.",
      "Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,\u201d Trump said of Iran. He added, \u201cThat would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Barely noticeable only a few months ago, opposition is growing about fresh Israeli operations in Gaza even among the country\u2019s military reservists, some of whom have publicly called out the government for what they say is an immoral and politically motivated decision to continue the war.",
      "\u201cI refuse to commit war crimes,\u201d Yuval Ben Ari told NBC News earlier this month. \u201cThe patriotic thing to do is to say no.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs an Israeli, as a human being, I\u2019m calling the Israeli government to stop starving 2 million people,\u201d he said, adding that he felt shame and guilt because \u201cpeople inside Gaza are starving to death.\u201d",
      "As a reservist soldier, Ben Ari served two rotations inside Gaza, the first in the north of the enclave and the second in the south, and he is one of a growing number of former and current Israel Defense Forces personnel \u2014 including high-ranking commanders \u2014 who have voiced their concerns about the country\u2019s conduct in the war.",
      "This pushback has only grown after the Netanyahu government announced a major new operation dubbed \u201cGideon\u2019s Chariot,\u201d which began earlier this month.",
      "Over 12,000 current and former service members signed a series of letters since the collapse of the ceasefire in March calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to end the war and declaring they will refuse to serve if it continues, according to Restart Israel, an activist group that tracks how many people oppose the government\u2019s actions.",
      "NBC News has approached the IDF for comment about the letters. In a statement to The Associated Press after one of the letters was released last month, the military said it should be \u201cabove all political dispute.\u201d",
      "Speaking in Israel\u2019s southern city of Sderot, which sits a few hundred yards from the Gaza border, meaning the ruins in Gaza are visible and the sound of explosions and aircraft overhead are omnipresent, Ben Ari said he convinced the IDF to let him re-enlist after the Hamas-led terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "Despite a leg injury, he said he felt he should join the army to protect his homeland. But during his first deployment in Gaza late last year, he said he quickly became disillusioned by the destruction he witnessed.",
      "Sent to southern Gaza when Israel resumed its military campaign in March, Ben Ari said he came to the realization that he could no longer serve in good conscience. So a week into his monthlong rotation, he said he asked his commander to be relieved of his duty and made his way to the border.",
      "As soon as he was back inside Israel, he wrote on social media, \u201cI will no longer wear this uniform under the current government.\u201d",
      "While most of his friends and family applauded his stance, Ben Ari said, others called him a traitor and accused him of selfishness and abandoning the remaining hostages \u2014 criticism he said he expected. He later penned an anonymous article for Israel\u2019s highly respected Haaretz newspaper about his experiences.",
      "However, he is far from alone in expressing his disquiet after Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas in early March and imposed a blockade preventing food, fuel and medical supplies from entering Gaza, where Israeli attacks have killed more than 54,000 people since the current conflict began, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "The IDF would not comment on the number of reservists it uses or the size of its overall forces.",
      "\u201cThey are not saying, \u2018Stop the war because we are tired,\u2019\u201d Guy Poran, a retired Israeli air force pilot, said in an interview at his home in Tel Aviv earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019re saying this war is not legitimate.\u201d",
      "Poran, 69, who helped initiate an anti-war letter signed by almost 1,200 current and former air force members, added that Netanyahu, who is currently on trial over allegations of bribery and fraud, \u201cis deeply in trouble, indicted with very serious criminal charges.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the string of corruption probes.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s political survival lies in the hands of his partners \u201con the extreme right,\u201d Poran said, referring to ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, both of whom have threatened to bring down the government if Israel agrees to a ceasefire with Hamas, while also calling for the total annihilation of the militant group and, more generally, the reoccupation and resettlement of Gaza by Israel.",
      "Israel, Poran added, is held \u201chostage because of this blackmail.\u201d",
      "NBC News has approached Netanyahu\u2019s office for comment.",
      "One of the letter\u2019s signatories, a major in the air force reserve, said they added their name because both the actions of the government and the way some ministers spoke freely about starving people in Gaza were not what you would see from \u201ca normal, moral government,\u201d and they thought the ministers were \u201closing it.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomehow the military has to put a stop sign in front of them,\u201d they added.",
      "Asked about concerns from some reservists that the war was being conducted for political purposes, the IDF did not respond directly. \u201cReservists, who leave behind their families, daily routines, jobs, and studies to repeatedly stand in defense of the country\u2019s security and its citizens, are a central pillar of the IDF\u2019s strength,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "In a separate interview, a lieutenant colonel in the air force reserve objected to the resumption of military activities in Gaza over fears that Israeli forces \u201cwill probably kill our own,\u201d they said, referring to the 58 hostages who remain in captivity, although the majority are believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cThis is a red line,\u201d they said, adding that Netanyahu and his coalition were neglecting the hostages \u201cin order to preserve their own government.\u201d",
      "NBC News agreed not to use their names because they feared for their safety and their jobs, although under Israeli law, employers must have a legitimate reason to fire someone and follow due process before terminating their employment.",
      "The army has nonetheless dismissed or threatened to dismiss service reservists who signed the letter, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Along with Poran and Ben Ari, both reservists spoke before Israel lifted its blockade on aid entering Gaza earlier this month, around three months after it began.",
      "The move was condemned by Ben-Gvir, who called it \u201cfoolish\u201d and \u201cmorally wrong\u201d in a Monday post on X. Smotrich and Israel\u2019s Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu have previously been criticized for similar statements.",
      "Poran said there was a growing feeling that \u201cit has become a revenge war, and that too many civilians are being killed, innocent, children, women, unnecessarily,\u201d Poran said.",
      "\u201cEven the army says it cannot be a long-term solution\u201d he added. \u201dIf we occupy there, we have to take care of their food, of their health, of their school system, of their sewage. Who\u2019s going to do it?\u201d",
      "\u201cYou cannot just displace 2 million people,\u201d Ben Ari said. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman.\u201d"

      "Torrents of predawn rain unleashed flooding that killed at least 111 people in a market town where northern Nigerian farmers sell their wares to traders from the south, officials said Friday, predicting the death toll would grow.",
      "The Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency did not immediately say how much rain fell after midnight Thursday in the town of Mokwa in the state of Niger more than 180 miles west of Abuja, the capital of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.",
      "Communities in northern Nigeria have been experiencing prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change and excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during the brief wet season.",
      "In videos and photos on social media, floodwaters covered neighborhoods and homes were submerged, with their roofs barely visible above the brown colored waters. Waist-deep in water, residents tried to salvage what they could, or rescue others.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China, while insisting that they also contribute more to their own defense.",
      "He said Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the U.S. has pledged to defend.",
      "China\u2019s army \u201cis rehearsing for the real deal,\u201d Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat it \u2014 the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d",
      "China has a stated goal of having its military have the capability to take Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.",
      "But China also has built sophisticated man-made islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and developed highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the United States to create its own space-based \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defenses.",
      "Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it\u2019s \u201cactively training for it, every day.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.",
      "He urged countries in the region to increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute.",
      "\u201cWe must all do our part,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Following the speech, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat Kaja Kallas pushed back at Hegseth\u2019s comment that European countries should focus their defense efforts in their own region and leave the Indo-Pacific more to the U.S. She said that with North Korean troops fighting for Russia and China supporting Moscow, European and Asian security were \u201cvery much interlinked.\u201d",
      "He also repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster U.S. military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific to provide a more robust deterrent. While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific and established new military agreements throughout the region, a full shift has never been realized.",
      "Instead, U.S. military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the first few months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, that\u2019s also been the case.",
      "In the last few months the Trump administration has taken a Patriot missile defense battalion out of the Indo-Pacific in order to send it to the Middle East, a massive logistical operation that required 73 military cargo aircraft flights, and sent Coast Guard ships back to the U.S. to help defend the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Hegseth also cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.",
      "\u201cEconomic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Asked how he would reconcile that statement with Trump\u2019s threat of steep tariffs on most in the region, Hegseth he was \u201cin the business of tanks, not trade.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s Defense Minister Richard Marles welcomed Hegseth\u2019s assurance that the Indo-Pacific was an American strategic priority and agreed that Australia and other nations needed to do their part.",
      "\u201cReality is that there is no effective balance of power in this region absent the United States, but we cannot leave it to the United States alone,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Marles suggested the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive trade policies were counterproductive. \u201cThe shock and disruption from the high tariffs has been costly and destabilizing.\u201d",
      "China usually sends its own defense minister to this conference, but Dong Jun did not attend this year in a snub to the U.S. over the erratic tariff war Trump has ignited with Beijing. Their absence was something the U.S. delegation said it intended to capitalize on.",
      "\u201cWe are here this morning. And somebody else isn\u2019t,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth said committing U.S. support for Indo-Pacific nations would not require local governments to align with the West on cultural or climate issues.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the U.S. can or wants to supplant China as the region\u2019s primary economic driver. But Hegseth\u2019s push follows Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East, which resulted in billions of dollars in new defense agreements."
